While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as standalone melodies and had no swing in them. Heavy metal took on darker characteristics after Black Sabbath's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s. In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by hardcore punk, and which further differentiated the two styles.

Russia captured Viborg in 1710 and successfully held it against Swedish attempts to retake the town in 1711. In 1712 the first Russian campaign to capture Finland began under the command of General Admiral Fyodor Apraksin. Apraksin gathered an army of 15,000 men at Vyborg and started the operation in late August. Swedish General Georg Henrik Lybecker chose not to face the Russians with his 7,500 men in the prepared positions close to Vyborg and instead withdrew west of Kymijoki river using scorched earth tactics. Apraksin's forces reached the river but chose not to cross it and instead withdrew back to Vyborg, likely due to problems in supply. Swedish efforts to maintain their defences were greatly hampered by the drain of manpower by the continental army and various garrisons around the Baltic Sea as well as by the plague outbreak that struck Finland and Sweden]] between 17101713, which devastated the land killing, amongst others, over half of the population of Helsingfors .

Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19thcentury racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of postcolonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply unanswerable): What did Margaret Meade use to argue against 19th century racial ideology?","output":"I'm sorry but that question contains a mistake.

These feathered creatures are caught in nets and then weighed and measured to gather data about their migration patterns and breeding habits. The research has been ongoing for several years and has provided valuable insight into the movements of these small birds. By analyzing the data, researchers can identify trends and patterns in the behavior of these birds, and in turn, use this information to develop effective strategies for their conservation and protection. Despite being a common sight in the skies, these birds face numerous threats, including habitat loss and climate change. By understanding their movements and behaviors, experts can create plans to mitigate these threats and ensure that their populations remain healthy and sustainable. The research project is a collaborative effort, with volunteers and experts working together to capture and study these birds. It is an important reminder of how citizen science can contribute to scientific understanding and conservation efforts. In conclusion, the ongoing research project that captures and studies up to a thousand Swallows, House Martins, and Sand Martins each night is doing vital work in understanding these species' migration and breeding habits.

The main reason behind this was the queen's failure to produce a son as an heir to the throne.

Longterm memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The hippocampus is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from shortterm to longterm memory, although it does not seem to store information itself.

Scratching can aggravate and spread skin conditions such as eczema or hives. Another important step is to wash affected skin carefully. It is crucial to use gentle soap and lukewarm water to prevent irritation. Moreover, it is vital to take care of the skin by keeping it moisturized. Dry skin can cause itching and lead to various skin infections. Wearing loose, comfortable, and clean clothing is another helpful tip to keep skin healthy. Tight clothing can cause itchy rashes and promote the growth of bacteria on the skin. Keeping clothing clean prevents the accumulation of dirt and germs. To avoid skin allergens, it is essential to identify the triggers and eliminate them. It is beneficial to keep a record of skin allergic reactions and assess what causes them. Common allergens include dust, pollen, and certain foods. Eliminating these allergens can decrease the chance of skin irritation. Lastly, reducing stress can prevent skin irritation. Stress can affect the immune system, making the skin more susceptible to infections and other skin problems. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can help to reduce stress levels. In conclusion, taking care of your skin is an essential part of your overall health.

However, there are various facial treatments that can help us rejuvenate and maintain a youthful appearance. Depending on your desired results, you can choose from a variety of facial treatments that range from quick and painless to more invasive procedures. One popular facial massage is the microneedling treatment, which can give you quicker skin-tightening results. If you want longer-lasting results, an ultrasound facial treatment may be the right option for you. This treatment uses ultrasound waves to penetrate deep into the skin, stimulating collagen production and tightening the skin. Another option is a radiofrequency facial that uses energy waves to stimulate collagen production and tighten the skin. This treatment can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles on the face, giving you a smoother and more youthful appearance. If you prefer a more aggressive approach, a laser skin resurfacing procedure can help reduce wrinkles and fine lines while also addressing other common skin concerns such as sun damage and acne scars. The procedure involves using a laser to stimulate collagen production and remove the top layer of the skin, revealing a smoother and more even complexion. For those seeking permanent results, a facelift may be the best option. This surgical procedure involves removing excess skin and tightening the remaining skin and muscles. Although it is a more invasive and expensive option, a facelift can provide dramatic and long-lasting results. In conclusion, there are many facial treatments available to those who want to maintain a youthful appearance. Whether you prefer a painless massage, a quick and effective treatment, or a more invasive procedure, there is an option for everyone. Before choosing a treatment, it is important to consult with a skincare professional to determine which option will work best for you."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with throughhole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about onequarter to onetenth of the size and weight of throughhole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. Some wireended components, such as 1N4148 smallsignal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.

As of 2019, there were approximately 25.6 million people of English descent living in the United States, while there were only around 11.2 million people of Irish descent. It is important to note that the Census Bureau defines \\"ancestry\\" or \\"ethnicity\\" as a person's self-reported heritage, which can vary based on individual interpretation and cultural identification. The methodology for collecting this data may also differ across time and geography, which can influence the accuracy of these figures. Additionally, some individuals may identify with multiple ethnic groups, making it more difficult to determine a clear numerical comparison between the two groups. Despite these limitations, the Census data provides valuable insights into the racial and ethnic composition of the United States. There are various factors that contribute to the larger population of ethnic English individuals, including historical migration patterns, the legacy of British colonialism, and ongoing immigration from the United Kingdom. Overall, while the Irish-American community continues to play an important role in shaping American culture and society, the English-American population remains slightly larger in size."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question Many middle and small powers in Europe, unlike in the previous wars, tried to steer clear away from the escalating conflict, even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents, like DenmarkNorway.

His early years were marked by political upheavals, which would significantly shape his future. Ratzinger was briefly a member of the Hitler Youth and later joined the Nazi army, although he deserted soon after. After the war, Ratzinger went back to school and eventually became a theology professor. He taught at several universities, including the University of Regensburg, where he gained international attention for his works on theology and philosophy. Ratzinger also rose up the ranks of the Roman Catholic Church. He was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising in 1977, after a long and distinguished career as a theologian. Ratzinger's strict enforcement of doctrine earned him the nickname \\"Cardinal No.\\" However, this reputation did not prevent him from rising to the position of head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a powerful office in the Vatican that he held for more than 20 years. In 2005, Ratzinger was elected Pope, becoming Pope Benedict XVI. His papacy lasted eight years, during which he reiterated his commitment to traditional Catholic teachings, while also speaking out against social and moral issues. He resigned in 2013, citing health reasons, and has since been living in seclusion. Joseph Ratzinger's life reflects his unwavering commitment to his faith and his strict enforcement of doctrine.

This is a growing concern for those who use hair extensions as a way to enhance their appearance. The inquest was focused on the death of Atasha Graham, who passed away in 2019 after using hair extensions. The court heard that the cause of death was due to the glue used in the extensions entering her bloodstream. It was suggested that dancing all night could have caused Graham to sweat, which in turn allowed the glue to enter her bloodstream. This highlights the importance of understanding the potential risks involved when using hair extensions and the need for proper precautions to be taken. It is crucial for individuals to be aware of the signs of an allergic reaction to hair extension glue. Symptoms may include itching, redness, and swelling, among others. If any of these symptoms are present, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. Hair extensions are a popular trend, but it is important to remember that they come with risks. Individuals should do their research and make sure that they are using glue that is safe and appropriate for their skin type.

Account hacking is more common than you might think. Checking Twitter on a Friday night is the new normal. Washington may be obsessed with Weiner, but Twitter users have moved on. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The Power and Perils of Twitter Twitter has transformed the way we consume and disseminate news. With its vast reach and lightning-fast communication, Twitter has become a key player in shaping the media landscape. However, as recent events have shown, Twitter is not without its challenges. One of the benefits of Twitter is its ability to spread news quickly and efficiently. With a few clicks of a button, breaking news can be shared with millions of followers around the world. However, this same feature can also be a double-edged sword. If misinformation or fake news is spread, it can be difficult to control or correct the narrative. Another challenge facing Twitter users is the prevalence of account hacking. Twitter's security measures are not foolproof, and hackers can gain access to personal information or use a compromised account to spread harmful content. It's important for users to take precautionary measures, such as setting up two-factor authentication, to protect their accounts. Despite these challenges, Twitter has become an essential part of our daily lives. Checking Twitter on a Friday night has become the new normal, as users share their thoughts and experiences in real-time. Twitter has also become a platform for activism, with social justice movements like Black Lives Matter gaining traction through the use of hashtags and viral tweets. Finally, it's important to note that while Washington may be obsessed with scandals like the Anthony Weiner saga, Twitter users have a more diverse range of interests. Twitter is a reflection of the world we live in, with users discussing everything from politics to pop culture. In conclusion, Twitter is a powerful tool that has revolutionized the way we consume and share news. However, users should be aware of the potential perils associated with the platform, from account hacking to the spread of fake news. By staying vigilant and using Twitter responsibly, we can continue to harness its power for good."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

To keep up with the demand, Scandinavian Airlines has announced a six-days-a-week service between Copenhagen and Humberside. The Deputy Prime Minister has claimed that investing in renewable energy could create up to 30,000 British jobs by the end of the decade. As the world moves towards sustainable energy sources, offshore wind farm projects such as the one off Lincolnshire coast are becoming increasingly common. However, maintaining these projects requires specialized workers with specific skills that may not be readily available in the local workforce. To address this issue, workers are being flown in from Scandinavia to keep the project up and running. To cater to the demand for such workers, Scandinavian Airlines has announced a new service between Copenhagen and Humberside. This service will run six days a week, providing a convenient way for the workers to travel back and forth between Denmark and the UK. This new service highlights the growing demand for renewable energy projects and the need for a global workforce with specialized skills. The Deputy Prime Minister has also spoken about the potential benefits of investing in renewable energy. He has claimed that up to 30,000 British jobs could be created by the end of the decade by investing in such projects. With the right infrastructure and support, the renewable energy industry could become a major source of employment and drive economic growth. In conclusion, the offshore wind farm project off the coast of Lincolnshire is a prime example of how renewable energy projects can drive economic growth and employment. While specialized skills may not always be readily available in the local workforce, the global community can come together to maintain and support these projects. The future of renewable energy looks bright, and it is essential that we invest in this industry to secure a sustainable future for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Q: Compared to the Sun, a red star most likely has a greater What is the correct answer to this question?

One example is Athens, which had been decisively defeated by Antipater in the Lamian war (323322) and had its port in the Piraeus garrisoned by Macedonian troops who supported a conservative oligarchy. After Demetrius Poliorcetes captured Athens in 307 and restored the democracy, the Athenians honored him and his father Antigonus by placing gold statues of them on the agora and granting them the title of king. Athens later allied itself to Ptolemaic Egypt to throw off Macedonian rule, eventually setting up a religious cult for the Ptolemaic kings and naming one of the city phyles in honor of Ptolemy for his aid against Macedon. In spite of the Ptolemaic monies and fleets backing their endeavors, Athens and Sparta were defeated by Antigonus II during the Chremonidean War (26761).

Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights. In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judgemade remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most famous is the Miranda warning.

The experimental treatment is more commonly used to treat nervous system disorders. Doctors are testing it out for depression and OCD.","output":"Deep Brain Stimulation: A Promising Experimental Treatment Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an experimental treatment that involves the implantation of electrodes in the brain to stimulate certain brain regions. Originally used to treat nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease, DBS is now being tested for the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In Parkinson's disease, DBS electrodes are placed in the brain to regulate movement and tremors. The electrodes produce electrical signals that block abnormal nerve signals that cause tremors. However, the use of DBS for depression and OCD is still in the experimental stage. Depression is a common psychiatric disorder that affects millions of people around the world. It is a serious illness that can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Antidepressant drugs and therapy are two of the most common treatments for depression. However, in some cases, these treatments may not work, and alternative treatments like DBS are being explored. In DBS for depression, brain electrodes are implanted in the brain's mood-regulating area. The electrodes stimulate this region, which can alleviate depression symptoms. DBS for OCD has shown promise in patients who have not responded to traditional treatments such as medication and therapy. In OCD, brain circuits that manage behaviors and thoughts are not functioning correctly, resulting in repetitive, uncontrollable thoughts and behaviors. DBS electrodes are placed in the brain circuits that manage these behaviors and thoughts. The electrodes send electrical signals to block the abnormal signals that cause OCD symptoms. Deep brain stimulation is still an experimental treatment for depression and OCD, but it has shown promise in early studies. Although DBS does not cure depression or OCD, it can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life for some patients. However, DBS is not for everyone, and it is essential to speak with a doctor before considering the treatment. In conclusion, deep brain stimulation is a promising experimental treatment for depression and OCD. Although it is more commonly used to treat nervous system disorders like Parkinson's disease, it has shown promise for alleviating symptoms of depression and OCD when traditional treatments fail. As research into DBS continues, it could become an increasingly significant tool in the management of these debilitating conditions."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","output":"\\"Marvel's latest film is a must-see for superhero fans.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Former Rwandan militia leader, Idephonse Nizeyimana, has been arrested and extradited to Tanzania to stand trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Nizeyimana was picked up from a hotel north of the Ugandan capital, and the police have confirmed that he is among the top three most-wanted suspects. The charges centre around his role in the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994. The attacks on ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus led to the deaths of over a million people. Nizeyimana is believed to have played an important role in these atrocities, with some figures estimating that he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people. This latest arrest is a significant step towards bringing those responsible for the genocide to justice. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established in 1995 to prosecute individuals for the most serious violations of international law. It has been instrumental in bringing a number of high-profile suspects to justice, including the former prime minister, Jean Kambanda, who was convicted in 1998. Despite these successes, there is still much work to be done. Many of the suspects responsible for the genocide are still at large, and bringing them to justice is a difficult and complex process. Nevertheless, the efforts of the international community are making a difference, and each new arrest serves to demonstrate that those who commit such atrocities will eventually be held accountable for their actions. The people of Rwanda have suffered a great deal, and their path to healing and reconciliation will be a long and difficult one. However, each new step towards justice brings us closer to the day when those affected by the genocide can begin to rebuild their lives and look towards a brighter future. The arrest of Idephonse Nizeyimana is just one such step, but it is an important one that sends a clear message to those who would seek to commit similar atrocities in the future."},{"instruction":"Solve 48*n = n + 6*n 53 for n.

Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogencontaining amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose.

It is a tragic reminder of the importance of mental health awareness and the need for resources to support those who struggle with these issues. The incident also raises questions about the use of derogatory language and the impact it can have on an individual's mental state. While it is unclear if the rap collective's message directly contributed to Johnson's actions, the fact that it was intended to be hurtful and dismissive cannot be dismissed. In conclusion, this is a deeply saddening story that highlights the importance of promoting mental health resources and the need for thoughtful and respectful language.

Experts predicted that people who believe in guardian spirits would take more risks, but they found that believers are less likely to take risks. This may be because they use an angel as a coping mechanism to deal with their fear and anxiety over perceived risks in their environment, experts say. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A recent study by York University, Canada, has shed light on the link between belief in guardian spirits and risk-taking behavior. Contrary to popular belief, the study found that individuals who believe in guardian spirits are actually less likely to take risks. Experts initially predicted that believers in guardian spirits would be more prone to risk-taking behavior, given the nature of their faith. However, the study's findings surprised everyone. Instead of being risk-takers, believers in guardian spirits were found to be more cautious and conservative in their approach to situations. One possible reason for this phenomenon is the use of guardian spirits as a coping mechanism. Believers may turn to their faith as a way to deal with the fear and anxiety surrounding potential risks in their environment. By relying on the comfort and protection of a guardian spirit, they feel more secure and less compelled to take unnecessary risks. While some might view this as a negative outcome, there are positive implications to be drawn from this study as well. For one, it could help to dispel negative stereotypes or assumptions about believers in guardian spirits being reckless. By showing that these individuals are, in fact, quite cautious, the study could help bridge gaps between different belief systems and foster greater understanding and respect. Furthermore, the study highlights the powerful role that faith and spirituality can play in our lives. Whether we believe in guardian spirits or other entities, many of us turn to faith as a way to cope with the challenges and uncertainties of life. By acknowledging and honoring these beliefs, we can find greater inner peace and strength — and perhaps even reduce our overall risk-taking behavior in the process."},{"instruction":"Question: In politics, psephology is the study of what?

This comes after Chisora sparked controversy in the build-up to the bout in Munich by slapping Klitschko at the weigh-in. Chisora then made news again by brawling with fellow British boxer David Haye at the post-fight press conference.

The ban serves as a strong message to all professional boxers to uphold the values and principles of the sport both in and out of the ring. Chisora's actions have drawn criticism from the wider boxing community, with many questioning whether he should be allowed to continue to compete professionally. Some have argued that this ban should be extended to other governing bodies to ensure that the sport continues to be respected by all those involved. Regardless of the debate surrounding Chisora's future in boxing, it is clear that the WBC believes his behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

Another crucial aspect of a real smile is the involvement of the eyes. A genuine smile includes a subtle crinkling of the corners of the eyes, also known as crow's feet. This movement indicates that your smile is sincere and that you're genuinely happy to see someone. To learn how to smile with your eyes, practice holding a soft gaze while you smile, rather than staring or looking away. Finally, remember always to check in on yourself to see how your smile looks. The best way to do this is by practicing in front of a mirror. Take note of how your mouth and eyes move and how your face feels when you smile. This feedback will allow you to adjust your technique and ensure that you're always presenting your best self. By following these tips, you'll become more adept at delivering a genuine and effective smile. Not only will this make a positive impression on the people you interact with, but it can also improve your own mood and well-being. Smiling is a simple but powerful tool that can help you navigate any situation with grace and confidence."},{"instruction":"Data: Adam Koc, battle, World War I; Adam Koc, award, Legion of Honour Sentence about the following d","output":"Adam Koc was awarded the Legion of Honour for his service in the battle during World War I."},{"instruction":"They delivered late which was great as an alternative to Sushi Express but the texture of their sushi was a little off.

Researchers say the beauty of sheep is that they stick together easily transmitting data between the flock. When the flock comes close to an internet receiving station it would transmit data to researchers at Lancaster University. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In today's digital age, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we perceive any physical object. IoT suggests that all devices could communicate data over the internet, creating a network of smart and interconnected gadgets. Recently, researchers in rural Wales have begun an exciting project called the \\"Internet of Sheep,\\" which aims to attach IoT devices to sheep to collect valuable data. This endeavor is conducted by researchers at Lancaster University who hope to use this innovative system to observe the grazing habits of sheep. The researchers have stated that the beauty of using sheep for this project lies in their natural behavior of sticking together in a flock. This mannerism of sheep allows for efficient communication and transmission of data between the devices attached to each sheep. The small IoT devices attached to the sheep gather important information, such as the distance traveled, food consumption, and duration of grazing. Once the flock comes close to an internet receiving station, the collected data is transmitted to Lancaster University's researchers. Experts believe that this data can be of great significance for the livestock industry, as it could help farmers optimize their grazing practices and enhance their livestock's overall health. They believe that real-time monitoring could help detect potential health issues and inform farmers promptly, enabling them to take necessary preventive measures. In conclusion, the Internet of Sheep seems to be an excellent opportunity to harness the power of IoT and animal behavior for a worthy cause. This project could empower farmers with valuable data and help further optimize livestock management practices, thus leading to better animal welfare and improved productivity."},{"instruction":"Generate a movie review with positive sentiment.","output":"The film I just watched was absolutely fantastic!

They are the first to have detected neutrinos created in the sun's core, thanks to the Borexino instrument located in Italy. The results of their research show that the fusion process responsible for 99 per cent of the sun's power is real and functions just as our theories have stated for years. What are neutrinos, you might ask? These subatomic particles are created through a fusion process that occurs in the sun's core, which generates its power. In fact, every square inch of our planet is hit by roughly 420 billion solar neutrinos every second! However, neutrinos are hard to detect, which makes their discovery even more significant. The findings by physicists from the University of Massachusetts Amherst help to reinforce scientific theories regarding the fusion process responsible for generating the sun's power. It is groundbreaking research that proves these theories are true and accurate. In conclusion, the detection of neutrinos created in the sun's core is a significant milestone in the scientific community.

Write them a letter. Talk to someone you trust. Be prepared to be denied.","output":"Having private conversations with parents or guardians can be challenging, especially if the topic to be discussed is a sensitive one. However, asking for a private conversation with your parent or guardian is an essential step when faced with issues that you cannot handle alone. One effective way to ask for a private conversation with a parent or guardian is to write them a letter. This way, you can express your thoughts and feelings in a clear and concise manner without being interrupted. In the letter, make sure to specify the reason why you want to speak with them privately and let them know that you value their opinion and guidance. Another alternative is to talk to someone you trust, like your teacher or counselor. They can offer support and help you figure out how to approach your parent or guardian about the issue. Sometimes, it’s easier to talk to a neutral third party before having the conversation with the person you want to address. It is important to be prepared to be denied when asking for a private conversation. Some parents or guardians might not be willing to have the conversation at that moment, but that doesn't mean that they are not willing to listen at all. Respect their decision and try to find another opportunity to have the conversation. In conclusion, when faced with issues that require the involvement of a parent or guardian, it’s important to ask for a private conversation to express your thoughts and feelings. Writing a letter or talking to someone you trust can help you prepare for the conversation, but be prepared to be denied and find another opportunity to speak with the person.

The dispute began after Fleming incorporated elements of an undeveloped film script written by McClory and screenwriter Jack Whittingham—including characters and plot points—into Thunderball, which McClory contested in court, claiming ownership over elements of the novel. In 1963, Fleming settled out of court with McClory, in an agreement which awarded McClory the film rights. This enabled him to become a producer for the 1965 film Thunderball—with Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as executive producers—and the nonEon film Never Say Never Again, an updated remake of Thunderball, in 1983.[N 3] A second remake, entitled Warhead 2000 A.D., was planned for production and release in the 1990s before being abandoned.
