The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics. It divides every 16 to 20 hours, which is an extremely slow rate compared with other bacteria, which usually divide in less than an hour. Mycobacteria have an outer membrane lipid bilayer. If a Gram stain is performed, MTB either stains very weakly Grampositive or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall.

Shaving is an option that can provide you with a quick and easy solution, but it's important to do it correctly to avoid skin irritation or unwanted hair growth. First of all, note that shaving your unibrow is a short-term solution. The hair will grow back within a few days, so you'll need to repeat the process regularly. If you're looking for something more long-lasting, consider other options such as tweezing or waxing, which can keep your unibrow at bay for a couple of weeks. If shaving is your preferred method, invest in an eyebrow touch up razor, which is specifically designed to shave eyebrows. These razors are smaller and more precise than regular ones, making it easier to target only the hair you want to remove. Before you start shaving, make sure your skin is clean and free of any products or debris. You can use a gentle cleanser or toner to remove any dirt or oils that might interfere with the razor's glide. Next, apply a small amount of standard shaving cream to your unibrow. This will help reduce friction and prevent razor burn or cuts. Be sure to spread the cream evenly and avoid applying too much, which could create a mess. Take your razor and run it under water to wet the blade. Then, gently glide the razor over your unibrow, starting from the outside and working your way inwards. Take your time and use short, controlled strokes to avoid removing more hair than necessary. Once you've finished shaving, wipe off the shaving cream and hair with a wet washcloth. Rinse your skin with cool water and pat it dry with a clean towel. Avoid rubbing or scratching your skin, which could cause irritation or inflammation. Finally, don't forget to moisturize your skin to help replenish its natural oils and prevent dryness. You can use a lightweight lotion or serum that won't clog your pores or make your skin greasy. In conclusion, shaving your unibrow can be a quick and easy way to get rid of unwanted hair. Just make sure to use the right razor, apply shaving cream, and take your time to avoid any mishaps. With a little practice, you'll be able to get a smooth and flawless look in no time."},{"instruction":"Tweet: I wait for @liiiindsaay Predict the sentiment of this tweet.

The meeting comes at a time when more than 1,000 people have lost their lives in what can only be described as 'urban warfare' in Cairo. Many people find it difficult to justify the distribution of aid to countries where there is so much unrest and violence. The fact that the leaders of Egypt will be receiving such a significant amount of money at this time has divided opinions. On the one hand, some argue that it is important to continue to provide aid to Egypt in order to support the country and its people. They believe that it is crucial to maintain stability and prevent further unrest. On the other hand, others argue that giving money to leaders who are not properly managing the situation in their country is not the solution. Instead, they suggest that the aid should be given to groups who are working to create positive change in Egypt and alleviate the suffering of the people. Regardless of the opinions, one thing is clear: the situation in Egypt is dire. The recent 'urban warfare' has caused a significant loss of life and has left many people feeling lost and hopeless. It is important that the international community continues to monitor the situation closely and work towards finding a solution that brings real change for the people of Egypt.

In one technique, the pie crust is lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper, then filled with pastry or pie weights (sometimes called \`\`baking beans'') to ensure the crust retains its shape while baking. Pieweights are available as ceramic or metal beads, but rice, dried peas, lentils, beans or other pulses can be used instead. When using this method for a fully baked crust, the weights are removed before the prebaking is complete in order to achieve a browned crust. Another technique dispenses with weights by placing a second pie tin on top of the crust, then inverting the tins to bake. In this method, the crust browns between the tins. A further simplified technique involves piercing the crust repeatedly with the tines of a fork to produce small holes, allowing steam to escape and preventing the crust from bubbling up, but that does not work with soft doughs such as pâte sucrée.

With gridtied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Hillary Clinton's highly anticipated memoir 'Hard Choices' has been deemed a 'newsless snore' and 'low-salt, low-fat, low-calorie' by early readers ahead of its release today. With the snippets that have been leaked, it seems that Clinton goes out of her way to portray her former colleagues and the president positively rather than giving readers her real opinions. While readers might have expected dish on her time as secretary of state, journalists from The New York Times and The Daily Beast have criticized the memoir for lacking substance. Instead, Clinton seems to focus more on the positive aspects of her time in office, with no real, tangible insights. The book has been described as a shallow offering, with vanilla pudding as the dessert. Critics have noted that Clinton's account of her tenure as secretary of state leaves out a lot of the gritty details, and instead opts to give readers a shiny, polished version of events. This has led some to speculate whether this is a calculated move, designed to paint Clinton in a more positive light ahead of any future political ambitions. All in all, it seems that 'Hard Choices' is unlikely to provide any major revelations or insights into Clinton's life and career - it's a 'vanilla' version of events that leaves readers wanting for more."},{"instruction":"k mutual funds rebounded smartly in the fourth quarter from their postsept .

Run your washing machine and dishwasher only when they are full. Check for leaks regularly. Take your climate into consideration when landscaping. Don't wash your car that often.","output":"As the world’s population continues to grow, so does the demand for resources such as water. Conserving water is one of the easiest and most effective ways to make a real difference in the fight against climate change, as well as to save money on your water bill. There are a number of simple and effective ways to conserve water, which can easily be implemented in your everyday routine. One of the easiest ways to conserve water is to take shorter showers. A five-minute shower uses far less water than a long, leisurely soak in the tub. Additionally, running your washing machine and dishwasher only when they are full can help to save significant amounts of water over time. A single large load of laundry can use as much as 40 gallons of water, so washing only full loads is a simple way to reduce water consumption. It's also important to check for leaks regularly. A small leak can waste a significant amount of water over time, so it's important to fix leaks as soon as they are detected. A slow drip from a faucet can waste as much as 20 gallons of water a day, while a leaky toilet can waste up to 200 gallons of water a day. When it comes to landscaping, it's important to take your climate into consideration. This means choosing plants that are native to your region and require less water, as well as using mulch to retain moisture in the soil. By planting native species, you can help to reduce water consumption in your garden and prevent the need for excessive watering. Finally, it's important to avoid washing your car too often. Instead of wasting water by hosing down your car every weekend, try using a bucket and sponge to wash your car by hand. Not only will this save water, but it will also give you a chance to get up close and personal with your car's finish, allowing you to check for any scratches or other issues that need attention. In conclusion, conserving water is one of the most important things we can do to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. By implementing these simple and effective water-saving methods in your everyday routine, you can make a real difference in the fight against climate change while also saving money on your water bill."},{"instruction":"begin your free file analysis, simply draganddrop your fat file inside the dotted lines below, or click browse my computer and select your file.

This is in direct contrast to a U.N. report that revealed 15 people died, 69 were hospitalized, and thousands more were treated as a result of the dumping. The toxic waste sites still have not been properly decontaminated according to the U.N. The dumping occurred in 2006 and saw the company depositing thousands of tonnes of waste in and around the city of Abidjan. The toxic chemicals, which are known to damage the respiratory and nervous systems, quickly caused widespread panic and outrage among locals. Despite the company's assertions that there were no harmful effects from the dumping, the U.N. report's findings highlight the grave repercussions on the Ivorian population. Those exposed to the toxic chemicals experienced vomiting, nausea, respiratory problems and had damaged immune systems - the elderly were particularly vulnerable. Moreover, the U.N. statement that the toxic waste sites are still contaminated years later is a damning indictment of Trafigura’s approach to environmental responsibility. The waste should have been cleaned up immediately, and the fact that it still has not been dealt with properly is unacceptable. This is not the first time that Trafigura has faced criticism for their environmental record. The company was previously involved in a large-scale oil spill in Nigeria that caused severe ecological damage. It is crucial that multinational firms, such as Trafigura, are held accountable for their actions and have a duty to clean up and attend to the negative effects of their waste. It is inexcusable that the company is still denying the harmful impact of their dumping in Ivory Coast, and it is imperative that measures are taken to prevent such occurrences in the future."},{"instruction":"Please answer a question about the following article about Samurai: For example, the full name of Oda Nobunaga would be Oda Kazusanosuke Saburo Nobunaga (織田上総介三郎信長), in which Oda is a clan or family name, Kazusanosuke is a title of vicegovernor of Kazusa province, Saburo is a formal nickname (yobina), and Nobunaga is an adult name (nanori) given at genpuku, the coming of age ceremony.

First, create a background by painting with your desired color. Let the paint dry completely before moving on to the next step. Next, sketch out the clouds you want to paint directly onto the background. This will give you an idea of where to place the colors as you start to layer. Once you have the basic sketch of the clouds, it's time to start layering over them with lighter shades of paint. This will give the clouds depth and make them look more realistic. Be sure to blend the paint where it meets the background to make it look seamless. To add interest to your painting, you can also add in patches of the background color in the spaces between the clouds. This will break up any monotony and give your painting a more dynamic look. Finally, to make the clouds pop even more, you can add highlights in a cream color. This will make the edges of the clouds stand out and give them a fluffy appearance. Remember to blend the highlights in with the rest of the paint for a cohesive look.

Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of nonupgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams.

In a statement, he said that such an inquiry \\"will involve yet more enormous cost, both to the public purse and the participants\\". Lord Leveson's inquiry, which began in 2011 and reported in 2012, resulted in a raft of proposed changes to press regulation, including the establishment of a new regulatory body, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO). However, critics of the press argue that IPSO has not done enough to hold newspapers to account, particularly in cases of intrusion and harassment. As a result, some have called for a new inquiry to be launched, to explore how best to enforce press standards and protect the public from abuses by media organisations. But Lord Leveson has urged caution, warning that any further inquiry would be costly and time-consuming. He also expressed doubt about whether a new inquiry would be able to achieve anything that his original inquiry had not. Instead, he suggested that efforts should be focused on improving the existing regulatory framework and strengthening IPSO's powers, so that it is better able to hold newspapers to account. Lord Leveson's comments are likely to be welcomed by some in the media, who have long argued that the existing regulatory framework is sufficient, and that a further inquiry would be a waste of public money. However, they are also likely to be criticised by those who feel that the press is still not doing enough to protect individuals' privacy and dignity. In conclusion, it is clear that there are strong views on both sides of the debate around press regulation, and the role that an inquiry might play in this. While some believe that a further investigation is needed to protect the public and reinforce press standards, others argue that this would be an unnecessary expense that would achieve little. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that there is scope for improvement in the way that the media operates, and how it is held accountable for its actions."},{"instruction":"(CNN What are highlight points for this article?","output":"I'm sorry, but you haven't provided the article or its title for me to identify the highlight points.

Caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green).

Eating a healthy, well-balanced diet is not only good for our internal health but also reflects on our skin. A diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants is crucial for healthy skin. Nutrients such as vitamin C, E, and A have been found to boost the skin's health, protecting it against damage, and promoting cell regeneration. Aside from proper nutrition, we must also protect our skin from the harmful effects of the sun. Excessive sun exposure can cause premature aging, sunburns, and even skin cancer. Whenever you go outside, it's best to wear protective clothing, such as long sleeves and hats, and apply sunscreen with a minimum SPF 30 to any exposed skin. In addition to our faces, we must also take care of our hands and feet, which tend to get neglected. Our hands and feet are constantly exposed to the elements and prone to dryness and cracking. Regular moisturizing, exfoliating, and cutting the nails regularly can keep them looking healthy and beautiful. In summary, eating a healthy diet, wearing sunscreen, and taking care of our hands and feet can significantly improve our skin's health and overall well-being. By incorporating these habits into our daily routine, we can maintain healthy, beautiful, and youthful-looking skin."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: After, the male adds a stick of butter to the bowl and the child begins to stir it and stick their hand in the bowl to taste it. while that OPTIONS: is happening, the woman reach for a milk and her child fell and began stomping her foot repeatedly and tried to get up.
