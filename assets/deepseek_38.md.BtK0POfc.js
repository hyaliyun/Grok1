However, these calendars have been a source of controversy since then, as many have criticized them for being sexist and demeaning. In 2011, thousands of people signed a petition calling for the company to stop producing these calendars. The petitioners argued that these calendars objectify women and reinforce gender stereotypes, as the women featured in them are only seen as sexual objects. They also criticized the company for using its female employees' looks to attract customers, instead of focusing on their skills or expertise. Despite the criticisms, Ryanair continued to publish these calendars until recently. In 2018, CEO Michael O'Leary announced that the company would stop producing them, stating that they no longer fit with the company's new family-friendly image. This decision was welcomed by many, as it shows that the company is slowly moving away from its controversial past. However, some argue that it took the company too long to realize that these calendars were offensive and that their decision was only made due to external pressures. Overall, the end of Ryanair's calendars is a positive step towards gender equality and respect for women. It is essential that companies move away from using women's bodies for advertising and focus on their talents and skills.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Corona del Mar High School's prom has been a hot topic recently due to the controversial practice of some boys using a draft system to select their prom dates. This method has drawn criticism from the school's principal, Kathy Scott, who has condemned the practice as objectifying girls. The draft system works like a sports draft, with the boys' group creating a ranked list of potential prom dates. The girls are then notified of their draft status and can either accept or decline the invitation. This process has been criticized for treating girls like commodities to be chosen and rated solely based on their desirability. Principal Kathy Scott was quick to condemn the practice, warning parents and students that it objectifies girls and goes against the values of the school. She urged students to approach prom with respect and kindness for all, rather than turning it into a competition. Many students have also spoken out against the draft system, with some girls feeling anxious about their draft rankings and others feeling pressure to compete for boys' attention. The controversy has brought wider attention to the issue of objectification of girls and the need for schools to teach respect and healthy relationships. While the draft system may seem harmless to some, it sends a troubling message about how girls' worth is measured and reinforces gender stereotypes. As prom season approaches, it's important for schools and communities to prioritize respect, inclusivity, and consent.

Based on fundamental research performed by Gregory Pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by Carl Djerassi at Syntex and by Frank Colton at G.D. Searle & Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960. The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones, and caused severe side effects. Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were on the pill, and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million.

It's not easy to go through challenging times alone, and there are people out there who want to help. There are three ways to get help: seeking professional help, relying on family and friends, and joining a support group. Professional help is available for those who need it. Therapists and counselors have the expertise and training to help people through difficult times. They provide a non-judgmental space to talk about issues that are causing stress, anxiety, or depression. They can offer coping strategies, resources and help create a plan to manage issues in life. Seeking help from a mental health professional is beneficial because talking to friends and family could often become a burden on the relationship. However, it's essential to have a support system in place. Family and friends can be a significant source of comfort and support. They know us best, and usually, we tend to listen to them more. It's important to communicate effectively and honestly with them about how we are feeling. When you have people in your life who care about you, it's easier to face challenges. Joining a support group can also provide comfort and understanding. It's helpful to be around people who are going through similar experiences. Support groups provide an indirect sense of accountability and normalization of common experiences. Hearing stories of how others got through a similar tough time can offer hope and inspiration. There are different kinds of groups available for various issues and needs. In conclusion, coping with challenging times can be easier when you have people to talk to and rely on. A support system not only offers emotional support, but different types of support, resources, and skills to help someone to navigate through any issues in life. Don't be afraid to seek professional help as well if needed.

Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II) literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech.

Float the fish initially. Transfer water to the bucket. Set up a siphon drip. Discard half the water once the water doubles. Transfer your fish to the main tank.","output":"If you're moving fish from one tank to another, it's important to do it properly to ensure that your fish survive the journey without any problems. To get started, you will need to gather all the necessary supplies before you begin. Once you have everything you need, you can follow these simple steps to move your fish safely and with minimal stress. First, you should float the fish in the water from the original tank. This will help to acclimate them to the temperature of the water in the new tank. You should do this for at least 15-20 minutes to allow your fish to adjust to the temperature difference. Next, transfer some of the water from the original tank to a clean bucket. It's important to use a clean bucket so as not to introduce any impurities or bacteria that could harm your fish. The amount of water you transfer will depend on how many fish you are moving, but a good rule of thumb is to transfer about half of the water. Once you have transferred the water, you should set up a siphon drip. This can be done by using a length of airline tubing and attaching it to the end of a funnel. Place the funnel in the top of the bucket and allow the water to start flowing through the tubing. Adjust the flow rate so that it is slow enough that it won't stress out your fish but fast enough to keep the water flowing steadily. As the water doubles in the bucket, you should discard half of it. You can repeat this process of adding water from the original tank and discarding half the water in the bucket until you have reached the desired amount of water in the bucket.

Susan May, 58, finally called the police on her son, Leigh May, 21. Leigh had been diagnosed with ADHD when he was five years old. This devastating story highlights the importance of mental health resources for both the person struggling and their family members. Susan's bravery in reporting her son's abuse led to Leigh's ban from visiting his mother or entering her road, as well as his suspended 20-month prison sentence. While it's important to hold individuals accountable for their actions, it's also critical to recognize the cycle of abuse and trauma that can occur in families where mental health resources are lacking. Children with ADHD often require specialized support and care, but access to these resources can be limited for low-income families. This can lead to a lack of diagnosis and treatment for ADHD, which can contribute to difficult behaviors and strained relationships within the family. As we strive towards a more just and equitable society, it is crucial to prioritize mental health resources for all individuals, regardless of financial or social status.

Young's package includes a basic salary of £350,000 and a bonus of £525,000, totaling almost £875,000. This news has sparked outrage, especially as RBS has received government support in the past. Many people are questioning the fairness of these high salaries and bonuses while the bank is still recovering from the financial crisis. Some argue that it sends the wrong message to the public, who may feel that the bank is not taking their concerns seriously. Others believe that such a high salary is simply unnecessary, especially considering the ongoing economic uncertainty. There are also concerns about the wider impact of such a high salary on society. Critics argue that it contributes to a growing income inequality gap and highlights the need for greater regulation of executive pay. As taxpayers bailed out RBS during the financial crisis, many people feel that they have a right to know how their money is being spent. It remains to be seen how RBS will respond to these criticisms, but it is clear that high executive salaries and bonuses remain a contentious issue within the banking sector.

Keen argues that these platforms gain immense power from the personal data provided by users. He adds that the hype around apps that secretly access data exposes a wider problem in the industry. Keen believes that social networking platforms' access to lists of friends is the crack cocaine of the industry. This data is valuable to companies as it provides insights into users' social circles and preferences. Companies can use this data to create targeted advertisements, making it a highly profitable business. However, this data collection directly impacts users’ privacy as often companies collect data in a covert manner. Many users remain uninformed about the extent of data collected about them, further increasing security concerns. Keen adds that the fear of being monitored or watched by tech giants such as Facebook and Google has led to a loss of trust between users and platforms. Despite growing concerns, social networking companies have struggled to implement effective data protection mechanisms. For instance, the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal saw Facebook embroiled in controversy after the political consulting firm harvested data from millions of Facebook accounts without user consent. In conclusion, Keen’s criticism of social networking platforms is valid as it highlights a growing problem of data exploitation. Companies must prioritize user privacy and implement stricter regulations to prevent further breaches of trust. Users must also remain vigilant and cautious of the data they share online."},{"instruction":"Data: Alan Bean, nationality, United States; Alan Bean, mission, Apollo 12; Alan Bean, birthPlace, Wheeler, Texas; Alan Bean, selectedByNasa, 1963; Alan Bean, status, Retired Sentence about the following d","output":"Alan Bean was a United States national who was part of the Apollo 12 mission.

In response, he has urged \\"all people\\" to join the military and pro-government militias. This follows his recent order to shut down an oil pipeline from South Sudan. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, but tensions between the two nations have remained high due to unresolved issues. One of these issues is the sharing of oil revenue. South Sudan has the majority of the oil reserves but relies on Sudan's pipelines to export them. Al-Bashir's decision to shut down the pipeline will have severe economic consequences for South Sudan. It is estimated that the country will lose around 2 billion a year in revenue, which is its main source of income. The accusation that South Sudan is using oil funds to arm mercenaries and traitors is a serious one, and if true, it would escalate tensions between the two nations even further. However, it is important to note that these claims have not been independently verified, and South Sudan has denied any wrongdoing. Al-Bashir's call to arms could also be seen as a move to consolidate his power. Sudan has faced significant protests in recent months, with many calling for al-Bashir to step down. By calling on civilians to join the military and pro-government militias, he may be trying to boost his support base. Overall, the situation between Sudan and South Sudan remains tense. The closure of the oil pipeline will have significant economic consequences for South Sudan, while the accusations of arming mercenaries and traitors could further escalate tensions between the two nations. It is crucial that both sides engage in dialogue to resolve these issues peacefully."},{"instruction":"Generate a negative review for a place.","output":"The place was an absolute disaster!

This war, also known as the Dutch War of Independence, began in 1568 when the Dutch rebelled against the rule of Spain. The Dutch Republic was seeking independence, religious freedom, and economic prosperity. The war was marked by brutal battles and sieges, including the Siege of Haarlem and the Siege of Leiden. Despite some early successes, the Dutch rebels found themselves on the defensive against the well-trained and well-equipped Spanish army. It wasn't until the Battle of Turnhout in 1597 that the Dutch gained a decisive victory, and this signaled to Spain that the war would be prolonged and costly. It was then that the Spanish court decided to initiate peace negotiations. In 1608, the Dutch and Spanish began negotiations for a peace treaty. These negotiations were long and difficult, but in 1609 the Twelve Years' Truce was signed, which put an end to the violence for a time.

See your doctor or get emergency medical help for a severe splinter. Watch for signs of infection. Consider leaving the splinter alone.","output":"If you've got a splinter, deciding whether to remove it yourself or seek medical attention can be a difficult decision. While minor splinters can typically be treated at home, more severe splinters that are deep or causing significant pain may require the attention of a doctor. If you're unsure whether to remove a splinter at home or not, a good rule of thumb is to watch for signs of infection. Redness, swelling, or warmth around the splinter are all signs of infection and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. It's also important to note that any splinter that is causing significant pain or discomfort should be evaluated by a doctor, as it could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. In these cases, it's best to seek emergency medical attention. For minor splinters, removing them at home can be done with a pair of sterilized tweezers. Be sure to wash your hands and the affected area thoroughly before attempting to remove the splinter. Gently pull the splinter out in the same direction that it entered, being careful not to dig deeper under the skin. However, not all splinters need to be removed right away. If the splinter is small and not causing any pain or discomfort, it may be best to simply leave it alone. The body's immune system will eventually destroy and absorb the splinter, and attempting to remove it may only cause further damage or infection. In summary, if you have a splinter, it's important to evaluate its severity and consider watching for signs of infection. Seek medical attention if the splinter is causing significant pain, or if there are signs of infection. For minor splinters, attempt to remove them at home with sterilized tweezers, and consider leaving small, painless splinters alone.

In a survey in a northeastern U.S. university of college students who identified as white, about 30% were estimated to have up to 10% African ancestry. Now answer this question: Who do many people who identify as white have for ancestors?","output":"Many people who identify as white have some African ancestors."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent of people were not from 2 or more races?","output":"According to recent data from the United States Census Bureau, as of 2020, approximately 69.4% of the population in the United States identified as White alone, not Hispanic or Latino. Additionally, about 12.2% of the population identified as Black or African American alone, while 5.7% identified as Asian alone. When it comes to people who identified as being of two or more races, the Census Bureau reports that about 2.8% of the population falls into this category. Therefore, if we subtract the percentage of people who identify as being of two or more races from the total population, we can determine the approximate percentage of people who do NOT fall into this category. Doing the math, it looks like this: 100% - 2.8% = 97.2% So, according to the latest census data, approximately 97.2% of people in the United States do not identify as being of two or more races. It's worth noting, however, that this figure only includes people who took part in the census and provided this information - there may be people who did not participate or who did not disclose this information.

None of the action sequences felt real, and hence, the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger. The film had potential, but it needed a better script, better acting, and a better director. I kept thinking during the film, you know, this movie would've worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director.

The case centres on a severely disabled woman who has been told by her local council that she is no longer entitled to state-funded education. The woman's family argue that she has a right to continue her education alongside children, something that the council disputes. The case is being seen as a test case for the idea that adults with learning difficulties should be able to share classes with children. Supporters of this approach argue that it could help to break down barriers between people of different ages and abilities, and promote greater understanding and empathy. The argument against it is that it could be difficult to accommodate adult needs within a classroom setting, and that it might not be appropriate to mix adults and children in this way. There are also concerns about the cost implications of such a move, as it could mean the need for additional teachers and support staff. Despite these concerns, the legal fight continues. The woman's family have secured the support of several disability rights groups, who argue that her right to an education is protected by law, and that the council is therefore acting unlawfully in denying it to her. The outcome of this case is likely to have a significant impact on the future provision of education for people with learning difficulties. It will be interesting to see how the courts respond, and whether or not they agree that the woman in question has a right to continue her education alongside children.

US President Barack Obama has expressed his confidence in Europe's ability to \\"break the fever\\" of its economic crisis through this new initiative. However, a spokesman for the EU commissioner has described the move as \\"financial paracetamol,\\" suggesting that it may only serve as a temporary solution to the ongoing problems facing the eurozone. Nonetheless, the economic news has had a positive impact on European stock markets. The FTSE-100 is up by 0.48%, while the CAC 40 has risen by 0.14%. The DAX has also seen a boost, rising by 0.37%. In conclusion, Chancellor Merkel's announcement of two eurozone funds worth €750bn marks a significant step forward in addressing the economic challenges facing the struggling southern European nations. This initiative will be underwritten by Germany and other wealthy eurozone members, and while it may only be a temporary solution, the positive impact on European stock markets suggests that it has already had a beneficial effect."},{"instruction":"What would be an example of an negative review?","output":"Example negative review: \\"Very disappointed with this product.

But it's not just about money and prestige - there's a genuine love for the sport that drives many of these celebrities to take part. Royalty is also a significant player in the racing world, with Queen Elizabeth II being one of the most prolific owners and breeders worldwide. Her Majesty has owned more than 1,500 racehorses and has bred several champions, including Estimate, who won the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in 2013. Beyond the UK, Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is another notable owner and breeder, having established his Godolphin racing operation in 1992. He has since had numerous successes in races around the world, including multiple wins in the Dubai World Cup. The link between soccer and horse racing may seem tenuous, but Manchester United has a long-standing partnership with the racing industry. They even have their own racehorse syndicate, Golden Goal, providing fans with a unique opportunity to share in the excitement of racehorse ownership. As for MC Hammer, his entry into horse racing may have been short-lived, but it was memorable. He famously purchased a colt named Dance Floor for 1.5 million in 1991. Though the horse never lived up to its lofty price tag, it was a sign of how the sport was opening up to new audiences.

Whether it’s the thrill of competition, the prestige of ownership, or the chance to be part of a unique community, there's no denying that horse racing has a timeless allure."},{"instruction":"ared of thunder..... and it's thundering What is the sentiment of this tweet?

If you do a false start, you are automatically disqualified in most competitions, unless the official says otherwise. OPTIONS: Some official ways of doing this are : Move out of the water and onto the platform. Skip a block and slog your way down to the floor after you've scored a point. Don't go past the 15 metre mark underwater. In any event you cannot pass this marker underwater, you have to have surfaced before this. Avoid situations where you will have to swim to be disqualified. There are some situations that can be responsible for you missing. Decide how far out you want to go.

Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earthbased telescopes.

Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit coadapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey.
