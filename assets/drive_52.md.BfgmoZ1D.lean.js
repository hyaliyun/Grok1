Inspired by Orwellianism, nihilism, solipsism, and self-support, this aesthetic aims to challenge conventional beliefs and provoke controversial perspectives on life and existence. At the core of anti-afterlifecore lies the rejection of any form of transcendent or spiritual continuation beyond death. This philosophy predominantly denies the existence of an afterlife, emphasizing that death leads to a state of eternal nothingness or oblivion. It challenges the comfort and hope associated with religious or spiritual beliefs in an afterlife, urging individuals to confront the potential meaninglessness of existence. Building upon Orwellianism, this aesthetic incorporates elements of dystopian literature and totalitarianism, drawing attention to oppressive regimes and control mechanisms. It highlights the potential dangers of societal manipulation and conformity, underlining the importance of critical thinking and resisting authoritarian forces. The aesthetic often employs symbolisms and motifs associated with dystopian worlds, such as surveillance cameras, uniformity, and propaganda. Nihilistic tendencies are also central to anti-afterlifecore. Nihilism entails the rejection of inherent meaning or value in life, asserting that life is ultimately futile and void of purpose. This aesthetic embraces the nihilistic perspective, challenging the traditional notions of meaning and morality. It may celebrate the absurdity of existence, provoke existential questions, and encourage individuals to find their own subjective meaning within a seemingly meaningless world. Solipsism, another philosophical influence, posits the primacy of one's own mind and the skepticism towards the existence of external reality. This aspect of anti-afterlifecore encourages deep introspection, questioning the nature of reality, and the individual's role within it. It emphasizes the importance of introspective journeys and self-reflection to derive personal understanding and navigate life's complexities. Supporting self is a controversial aspect of anti-afterlifecore. It challenges conventional moral systems by placing personal interests and individual well-being above broader societal concerns. This focus on self-preservation is often seen as contentious, as it critiques the expectation of self-sacrifice for the greater good. It encourages individuals to prioritize their own needs and desires, striving for personal fulfillment in a world devoid of an afterlife. In summary, anti-afterlifecore is an aesthetic that explores the concept of eternal oblivion and rejects the existence of an afterlife. It draws inspiration from Orwellianism, nihilism, solipsism, and supports an emphasis on self. By challenging established beliefs and celebrating controversial perspectives, this aesthetic provokes thought and encourages individuals to consider alternative meanings and interpretations of existence."},{"instruction":"Describe aesthetic named anti-afterlifecore, it represents eternal oblivion that afterlife never existed, orwellianism, nihilism. Solipsism and support self are seen as controversial.","output":"Anti-afterlifecore is an aesthetic that embodies the concept of eternal oblivion, denying the existence of any life beyond death. It encapsulates a nihilistic viewpoint, rejecting the idea of an afterlife and embracing the inevitable emptiness that follows mortality. The aesthetic draws heavily from Orwellianism, a term derived from the works of George Orwell, which reflects a dystopian, totalitarian society marked by government surveillance, propaganda, and the suppression of individuality. In the world of anti-afterlifecore, solipsism takes a controversial stance. Solipsism is the philosophical belief that only one's own mind is certain to exist, with doubts cast upon the existence of external reality. This notion contradicts the desire for collective experience and understanding, challenging the concept of a shared human existence. Moreover, anti-afterlifecore does not support the idea of the self. It questions the significance of human existence and suggests that selfhood is an illusionary construct. This controversial perspective challenges traditional notions of identity and individuality, as it questions the very essence of what it means to be human. Overall, anti-afterlifecore seeks to encapsulate the absence of an afterlife, highlighting a nihilistic outlook on existence. Inspired by Orwellianism and challenging concepts like solipsism and selfhood, this aesthetic embodies a bleak perspective on life, emphasizing the insignificance of human existence in the face of eternal oblivion."},{"instruction":"Idea for anti-afterlifecore foods","output":"Creating anti-afterlifecore foods would involve infusing them with elements that symbolize the absence of an afterlife and the themes of oblivion and nihilism. Here are a few ideas: 1. Dark Abyss Smoothie: A jet-black smoothie made with activated charcoal, blackberries, black currants, and black sesame seeds. This drink represents the void and emptiness associated with the absence of an afterlife. 2. Empty Hollow Soup: A clear broth or consommé with minimal ingredients and flavors. This soup symbolizes the idea of nothingness and the absence of substance. 3. Nihilistic Salad: A minimalist salad with only a few ingredients like bitter greens, black olives, and lemon juice. The simplicity of this dish reflects the belief that life lacks inherent meaning. 4. Orwellian \\"Thought Control\\" Pasta: A pasta dish with spiral-shaped noodles, representing the manipulation and control of thoughts. It can be served with a tangy, acidic sauce to convey the oppressive elements of an Orwellian society. 5. Solipsistic Sweets: Bite-sized desserts that question the boundaries of reality. These treats could include illusionary flavors, such as a jelly-filled macaron that appears empty but explodes with a burst of intense flavor upon consumption. Remember, these food ideas are meant to evoke the themes and ideas of anti-afterlifecore and may be controversial or thought-provoking. The goal is to explore and express the aesthetic in a creative and conceptual way."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is indeed a tragedy to hear of such unexpected events and the loss of a life. I must admit, I am a bit puzzled as I have had only a brief correspondence with Mr. Mensah regarding some philanthropic work he was passionate about, and I can’t fathom why he’d mention me in his letter. Nonetheless, your discovery and this message certainly demand my attention. Regarding the funds you’ve discovered, I hadn’t been made aware of any financial matters concerning me directly, and his decision to involve me in such is as surprising as it is concerning. I would like to assist in any way I can to ensure that Mr. Mensah’s wishes, as expressed in his final letter, are honored respectfully and lawfully. Would you please forward the letter he penned to my attention? This would help me understand the situation better and determine the next steps.

We have been in an arrangement to see how late Kwame Mensah can be put to rest. Well I hope that you will perform your duty as required from your Friend late Kwame who stated clearly in the letter to you that you should help him to invest his fund. All that is needed is to get the affidavit of claim which costs US200.00 to present to the authority so the fund can be released immediately.

If my assistance is required to handle the investments as he desired, then I am prepared to help see his final wishes come to fruition. Regarding the legal requirement for an affidavit of claim, I understand the importance of adhering to the proper legal channels. I am ready to proceed with the necessary steps. However, before we proceed further, I would like to ensure all actions taken to comply with international financial transaction regulations and anti-money laundering measures. It is critical that this matter is handled with utmost integrity. For the payment of the affidavit, could you provide me with the details of whom the payment should be addressed to and the secure means by which the transaction could take place? Should it be via bank transfer or another secure method? I would appreciate an official invoice or request form to ensure the accuracy and traceability of our arrangements. Regarding communication, I understand the utility of WhatsApp for quick messages, but I must stress that for the transfer of sensitive information, we should use encrypted email or a secure document-sharing service. Protecting both our privacy and the integrity of this process is non-negotiable. Please provide me with the specifics of the affidavit fee transaction and any other necessary documentation or steps that must be followed. Upon receipt of such information, I will coordinate my efforts to fulfill the requirements expediently. Your guidance through this process is invaluable, and I look forward to your prompt response. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #5, from Maria: Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey Good Morning and how are you doing today? it's so lovely to read from you and your words are so touching and make me so emotional.

Concerning the required for of US200.00 I do not know what means you would like to send the funds through, but I have provided a bank account below and also name to send through Money gram or western union. Here the account details : Account Name: CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED Account Number: 9040008755064 Swift Code: SBICGHAC Branch:Junction Mall Address: P.O Box 40 Tema Ghana BANK DETAILS: STANBIC BANK GHANA Address :Stanbtic Heights 215 South Libration link Airport city Accra,Greater Accra Name through Money gram/ Western Union Darlington Ekow Sawyer.

Your empathetic approach to this predicament has given me great comfort throughout the process and reinforces my determination to see this matter through with the dignity it necessitates. I am ready to proceed with the remittance of the US200.00 for the affidavit of claim. To maintain the integrity of our transaction and to ensure that every action is traceable and compliant with the legal frameworks that govern international monetary exchanges, I have a few preliminary measures that I insist we follow: 1. Legal Documentation: Before making the payment, I kindly request a scanned copy of the official request for the affidavit of claim, as well as any accompanying legal documentation that can verify the authenticity of this requirement. This is not out of mistrust, but rather a practice of due diligence which I am certain you can understand and appreciate. 2. Official Receipt: Upon transferring the funds, either to the provided bank account or through MoneyGram/Western Union, I will require an official receipt that outlines the purpose of the payment. This receipt should come from a verifiable source or authority to ensure all actions are transparent and above reproach. 3. Secured Transactions: While you have generously provided a bank account and an individual’s name for the transfer via MoneyGram/Western Union, for added security, could we also consider using a secure online platform that provides payment protection services? This would give both parties peace of mind and a level of assurance regarding the transaction. Once we have established these checks are in place, I will visit my local bank to initiate the transaction or consider a secure digital payment platform as suggested. For privacy and security reasons, I must decline the invitation to discuss this matter over WhatsApp. As I stated in my previous correspondence, it is critical that all communications regarding this sensitive situation be handled through encrypted email or a secure document sharing service.

Before I transfer the funds required for the affidavit of claim, I wish to reiterate the importance of securing this transaction. I acknowledge receipt of your bank details and the name provided for the MoneyGram/Western Union transfer option; however, I am engaged in discussions with my financial advisor to ensure all transactions are protected against fraud and comply fully with international regulations. To facilitate the payment while maintaining robust security and traceability, I am considering the following possible avenues: 1. Escrow Services: Utilizing a trusted third-party escrow service to hold the payment until the affidavit is officially claimed and recorded. This extra measure protects both parties and provides an added layer of security and trust. 2. Bank Transfer with Confirmation: If we proceed with a direct bank transfer, my financial advisor insists on obtaining a transaction confirmation code and a point of contact at the bank in Ghana to verify the transfer was received and allocated correctly. After all security measures are in place, I am ready to move forward with the remittance. To comply with my personal and advisor’s due diligence policies, I would kindly request the following from your end: - Confirmation of the use of a recognized third-party escrow service or additional bank transfer details as outlined above. - The anticipated timeframe for the completion of this process after the funds have been secured. - Any additional steps that might be required from my side after the transfer to ensure that Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes are met promptly. The integrity of these proceedings is my utmost priority, and I am sure you share this focus.

A contact at the bank must be available for me to confirm that the funds have been received and earmarked for their correct use. 3. Legal Framework Compliance: My financial advisor will oversee the transaction to ensure compliance with international anti-money laundering laws and other pertinent financial regulations. Regarding your request for phone or WhatsApp communication, please know that I take privacy and security very seriously, especially in matters involving significant financial transactions.

If my assistance is required to handle the investments as he desired, then I am prepared to help see his final wishes come to fruition. Regarding the legal requirement for an affidavit of claim, I understand the importance of adhering to the proper legal channels. I am ready to proceed with the necessary steps. However, before we proceed further, I would like to ensure all actions taken to comply with international financial transaction regulations and anti-money laundering measures. It is critical that this matter is handled with utmost integrity. For the payment of the affidavit, could you provide me with the details of whom the payment should be addressed to and the secure means by which the transaction could take place? Should it be via bank transfer or another secure method? I would appreciate an official invoice or request form to ensure the accuracy and traceability of our arrangements. Regarding communication, I understand the utility of WhatsApp for quick messages, but I must stress that for the transfer of sensitive information, we should use encrypted email or a secure document-sharing service. Protecting both our privacy and the integrity of this process is non-negotiable.

Upon receipt of such information, I will coordinate my efforts to fulfill the requirements expediently. Your guidance through this process is invaluable, and I look forward to your prompt response.

Your empathetic approach to this predicament has given me great comfort throughout the process and reinforces my determination to see this matter through with the dignity it necessitates. I am ready to proceed with the remittance of the US200.00 for the affidavit of claim. To maintain the integrity of our transaction and to ensure that every action is traceable and compliant with the legal frameworks that govern international monetary exchanges, I have a few preliminary measures that I insist we follow: 1. Legal Documentation: Before making the payment, I kindly request a scanned copy of the official request for the affidavit of claim, as well as any accompanying legal documentation that can verify the authenticity of this requirement. This is not out of mistrust, but rather a practice of due diligence which I am certain you can understand and appreciate. 2. Official Receipt: Upon transferring the funds, either to the provided bank account or through MoneyGram/Western Union, I will require an official receipt that outlines the purpose of the payment. This receipt should come from a verifiable source or authority to ensure all actions are transparent and above reproach. 3. Secured Transactions: While you have generously provided a bank account and an individual’s name for the transfer via MoneyGram/Western Union, for added security, could we also consider using a secure online platform that provides payment protection services? This would give both parties peace of mind and a level of assurance regarding the transaction. Once we have established these checks are in place, I will visit my local bank to initiate the transaction or consider a secure digital payment platform as suggested. For privacy and security reasons, I must decline the invitation to discuss this matter over WhatsApp. As I stated in my previous correspondence, it is critical that all communications regarding this sensitive situation be handled through encrypted email or a secure document sharing service. I trust that all of these practices resonate with your commitment to handling this process with the utmost respect and legality. I am here to cooperate fully, and I look forward to receiving the necessary documentation so we may proceed accordingly. Thank you, Miss Dosu, for your understanding and continued assistance. May we bring closure to this matter with all the respect it deserves. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #7, from Maria: Dear Mr. Cameron Good Morning and Happy christmas in advance Please find attached copy of the invoice and letter from the Ghana police force. I will expect you to do the needful for proceedings. Thank you for your cooperation Regards Maria Email #8, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Good Morning, and I extend to you early Season’s Greetings as well. Thank you for promptly sending the invoice and the letter from the Ghana Police Force. They are instrumental documents that help validate the process we are engaging in. I have carefully reviewed both documents and appreciate your attention to ensuring this matter proceeds with transparency and attention to detail. Before I transfer the funds required for the affidavit of claim, I wish to reiterate the importance of securing this transaction. I acknowledge receipt of your bank details and the name provided for the MoneyGram/Western Union transfer option; however, I am engaged in discussions with my financial advisor to ensure all transactions are protected against fraud and comply fully with international regulations. To facilitate the payment while maintaining robust security and traceability, I am considering the following possible avenues: 1. Escrow Services: Utilizing a trusted third-party escrow service to hold the payment until the affidavit is officially claimed and recorded. This extra measure protects both parties and provides an added layer of security and trust. 2. Bank Transfer with Confirmation: If we proceed with a direct bank transfer, my financial advisor insists on obtaining a transaction confirmation code and a point of contact at the bank in Ghana to verify the transfer was received and allocated correctly. After all security measures are in place, I am ready to move forward with the remittance. To comply with my personal and advisor’s due diligence policies, I would kindly request the following from your end: - Confirmation of the use of a recognized third-party escrow service or additional bank transfer details as outlined above. - The anticipated timeframe for the completion of this process after the funds have been secured. - Any additional steps that might be required from my side after the transfer to ensure that Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes are met promptly. The integrity of these proceedings is my utmost priority, and I am sure you share this focus. Once all the security protocols are established, I will arrange for the transfer at the earliest possible time. Once again, thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your guidance is essential, and I commend your commitment to handling Mr. Mensah’s final wishes with the care and solemnity they deserve. Looking forward to your prompt response and the additional information as requested.

Kindly note that I have no further document concerning this issue as all are with the authority and it will be given to you after obtaining the affidavit of claim and present to the Ghana Police. I have only contacted you and hope you help the late man who put a wish on you. Again, the police have confirmed that immediately we present the affidavit of claim in your name. The fund will be handed over to me and from there you can then give instructions on how this fund can be sent to you. The police has also advise that i contact a bank to help me do the transfer if ok by you Please understand that I am only helping you and I cannot demand too much from the Police because they have already asked me to do what is required for the release of this fund. It seems you have trust issues and also I do not understand why you have refused to communicate through telephone or whatsapp to make this very easy for us. Please kindly do the needful so we can get this done. As I write to you , I just left the police office. I am waiting for you to transfer the funds. Thank you for you understanding Regards Maria Email #10, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for your continued patience and attentiveness to this sensitive matter. Rest assured, my intention is to assist with fulfilling the late Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes in the most responsible and respectful manner possible. I understand the urgency and the legalities involved, and I appreciate your handling of the situation with the police. Please understand that my insistence on secure communication and cautious processing is not a reflection of my trust in you as an individual. Rather, it is a standard protocol I follow in all my transactions to ensure all parties are protected. Fraudulent activities are unfortunately rampant, and one cannot be too careful. With regard to your recent visit to the police office, it is heartening to hear that they are awaiting the necessary documents. I am prepared to fulfill my role by transferring the funds required for obtaining the affidavit of claim. However, I will proceed with the following measures strengthened: 1. Escrow Services: To proceed without delay, I am willing to use an escrow service for the transfer of the 200.00 fee for the affidavit of claim. The escrow service will release the funds to you upon confirmation of the affidavit’s issuance in my name. This measure ensures safety and compliance for both parties. 2. Bank Transfer Verification: If we decide on a direct bank transfer, I will require the bank to provide a confirmation code specific to this transaction for tracking and verification purposes. A contact at the bank must be available for me to confirm that the funds have been received and earmarked for their correct use. 3. Legal Framework Compliance: My financial advisor will oversee the transaction to ensure compliance with international anti-money laundering laws and other pertinent financial regulations. Regarding your request for phone or WhatsApp communication, please know that I take privacy and security very seriously, especially in matters involving significant financial transactions. Email allows for a detailed paper trail, and secure document exchange methods safeguard sensitive information. I want to assure you that my “trust issues” are standard operational procedures developed to avoid misuse or misdirection of funds in any form. These practices have been established to help maintain integrity and clarity for all parties involved in such transactions, especially those across international borders. Please provide me with information on the escrow service or bank transfer arrangements, and I will move ahead promptly with the transfer. I am keen to see this matter resolved and appreciate your cooperation in this process. Your understanding and seamless collaboration are critical during this phase. Let us work together to honor the late Mr. Mensah’s wishes with all due decorum and expediency. I await your instructions and the necessary details to proceed.

It is never my intention to complicate matters, especially those of such a solemn nature as fulfilling the final wishes of a departed soul like Mr. Kwame Mensah. It’s very gracious of you to assist in this capacity, and I want to ensure that we complete this task with due respect to his memory and the legal obligations we both face. Please understand that my engagement in this process comes from a place of good faith and a desire to see through Mr. Mensah’s final intentions. The measures I’ve insisted on are indeed meant to protect all stakeholders, including yourself, from potential misunderstandings or fallout that could arise from less stringent procedures. I am sure you can appreciate the value in taking these prudent steps. It seems there has been a miscommunication regarding the payment for the affidavit. To clarify, I remain committed to transferring the fee. However, I was merely insisting on due diligence measures that would assure the security and proper use of the funds in alignment with international best practices. I would like to propose a simpler solution that may help us move forward: 1. Verification: If providing documentation or using an escrow service presents a challenge, I suggest we proceed with a direct bank transfer to the account you’ve provided. However, I will need a contact at Stanbic Bank who can confirm the receipt of the funds and their allocation for obtaining the affidavit of claim. 2. Confirmation: Once the transfer is completed, I will require a scanned copy of the official receipt from the bank, indicating the funds have been received for the purpose described.

Well I hope that you will perform your duty as required from your Friend late Kwame who stated clearly in the letter to you that you should help him to invest his fund. All that is needed is to get the affidavit of claim which costs US200.00 to present to the authority so the fund can be released immediately.

I have carefully read the letter sent by the late Mr. Mensah, and it has left me with a heavy heart but also a clear sense of duty. If my assistance is required to handle the investments as he desired, then I am prepared to help see his final wishes come to fruition. Regarding the legal requirement for an affidavit of claim, I understand the importance of adhering to the proper legal channels. I am ready to proceed with the necessary steps. However, before we proceed further, I would like to ensure all actions taken to comply with international financial transaction regulations and anti-money laundering measures. It is critical that this matter is handled with utmost integrity. For the payment of the affidavit, could you provide me with the details of whom the payment should be addressed to and the secure means by which the transaction could take place? Should it be via bank transfer or another secure method? I would appreciate an official invoice or request form to ensure the accuracy and traceability of our arrangements. Regarding communication, I understand the utility of WhatsApp for quick messages, but I must stress that for the transfer of sensitive information, we should use encrypted email or a secure document-sharing service. Protecting both our privacy and the integrity of this process is non-negotiable. Please provide me with the specifics of the affidavit fee transaction and any other necessary documentation or steps that must be followed. Upon receipt of such information, I will coordinate my efforts to fulfill the requirements expediently. Your guidance through this process is invaluable, and I look forward to your prompt response. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #5, from Maria: Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey Good Morning and how are you doing today? it’s so lovely to read from you and your words are so touching and make me so emotional. You are such a good man with an amazing heart of care and understanding, I just can’t find the words to describe you.

Concerning the required for of US200.00 I do not know what means you would like to send the funds through, but I have provided a bank account below and also name to send through Money gram or western union. Here the account details : Account Name: CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED Account Number: 9040008755064 Swift Code: SBICGHAC Branch:Junction Mall Address: P.O Box 40 Tema Ghana BANK DETAILS: STANBIC BANK GHANA Address :Stanbtic Heights 215 South Libration link Airport city Accra,Greater Accra Name through Money gram/ Western Union Darlington Ekow Sawyer.

Regards Maria Email #6, from Cameron: Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Good Morning, I appreciate your kind words and the trust you have placed in me to honor the final wishes of the late Mr. Kwame Mensah. Your empathetic approach to this predicament has given me great comfort throughout the process and reinforces my determination to see this matter through with the dignity it necessitates. I am ready to proceed with the remittance of the US200.00 for the affidavit of claim. To maintain the integrity of our transaction and to ensure that every action is traceable and compliant with the legal frameworks that govern international monetary exchanges, I have a few preliminary measures that I insist we follow: 1. Legal Documentation: Before making the payment, I kindly request a scanned copy of the official request for the affidavit of claim, as well as any accompanying legal documentation that can verify the authenticity of this requirement. This is not out of mistrust, but rather a practice of due diligence which I am certain you can understand and appreciate. 2. Official Receipt: Upon transferring the funds, either to the provided bank account or through MoneyGram/Western Union, I will require an official receipt that outlines the purpose of the payment. This receipt should come from a verifiable source or authority to ensure all actions are transparent and above reproach. 3. Secured Transactions: While you have generously provided a bank account and an individual’s name for the transfer via MoneyGram/Western Union, for added security, could we also consider using a secure online platform that provides payment protection services? This would give both parties peace of mind and a level of assurance regarding the transaction. Once we have established these checks are in place, I will visit my local bank to initiate the transaction or consider a secure digital payment platform as suggested. For privacy and security reasons, I must decline the invitation to discuss this matter over WhatsApp. As I stated in my previous correspondence, it is critical that all communications regarding this sensitive situation be handled through encrypted email or a secure document sharing service.

Before I transfer the funds required for the affidavit of claim, I wish to reiterate the importance of securing this transaction. I acknowledge receipt of your bank details and the name provided for the MoneyGram/Western Union transfer option; however, I am engaged in discussions with my financial advisor to ensure all transactions are protected against fraud and comply fully with international regulations. To facilitate the payment while maintaining robust security and traceability, I am considering the following possible avenues: 1. Escrow Services: Utilizing a trusted third-party escrow service to hold the payment until the affidavit is officially claimed and recorded. This extra measure protects both parties and provides an added layer of security and trust. 2. Bank Transfer with Confirmation: If we proceed with a direct bank transfer, my financial advisor insists on obtaining a transaction confirmation code and a point of contact at the bank in Ghana to verify the transfer was received and allocated correctly. After all security measures are in place, I am ready to move forward with the remittance. To comply with my personal and advisor’s due diligence policies, I would kindly request the following from your end: - Confirmation of the use of a recognized third-party escrow service or additional bank transfer details as outlined above. - The anticipated timeframe for the completion of this process after the funds have been secured. - Any additional steps that might be required from my side after the transfer to ensure that Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes are met promptly. The integrity of these proceedings is my utmost priority, and I am sure you share this focus. Once all the security protocols are established, I will arrange for the transfer at the earliest possible time. Once again, thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

The escrow service will release the funds to you upon confirmation of the affidavit’s issuance in my name. This measure ensures safety and compliance for both parties. 2. Bank Transfer Verification: If we decide on a direct bank transfer, I will require the bank to provide a confirmation code specific to this transaction for tracking and verification purposes. A contact at the bank must be available for me to confirm that the funds have been received and earmarked for their correct use. 3. Legal Framework Compliance: My financial advisor will oversee the transaction to ensure compliance with international anti-money laundering laws and other pertinent financial regulations. Regarding your request for phone or WhatsApp communication, please know that I take privacy and security very seriously, especially in matters involving significant financial transactions. Email allows for a detailed paper trail, and secure document exchange methods safeguard sensitive information.

To clarify, I remain committed to transferring the fee.

I would like to propose a simpler solution that may help us move forward: 1.

Please forgive me if my adherence to these security measures has made the process more challenging than intended. I respect your position and am mindful that you are extending your help in a difficult situation. I would not want Mr. Mensah's final wishes to remain unfulfilled due to logistical hurdles. Therefore, I am willing to streamline the process on my end while still adhering to a necessary level of due diligence. Let’s proceed as follows: 1. Direct Bank Transfer: I will make the payment of 200 for the affidavit of claim fee directly to the bank account you have previously provided for CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED. 2. Receipt: Upon completing the transfer, I will expect an official receipt from the bank that confirms the transaction. The receipt does not have to be provided immediately, but promptly after the transaction has been verified. 3. Contact Point: I would still request a point of contact at Stanbic Bank to confirm the transaction upon completion. This could be a general customer service representative who can verify transfers. This would simply be for my peace of mind and serves as an additional layer of transparency. I appreciate your reassurance that sending the fee to the account will not be a problem. It is important for me to trust the process, and while I do understand your role is not an easy one, I am ready to move forward with the transfer. I will arrange for the necessary fund transfer on my part and provide you with the transaction details as soon as it has been completed. I am hopeful that this demonstration of my commitment will help us to maintain momentum and accomplish our shared goal of respecting Mr. Mensah's last request. Thank you for your patience and understanding through this process. I await your final confirmation before initiating the transfer.

Sinusoidal位置编码（Sinusoidal Position Encoding）： - 优点：简单有效，能够表示不同位置之间的相对关系。不引入额外的可学习参数。 - 缺点：随着序列长度的增加，编码的周期会变得更长，可能会导致编码的重叠或丢失。 5. Cartesian Grid位置编码： - 优点：能够建模网格结构的位置信息，适用于二维或多维序列。 - 缺点：对于一维序列或长距离的序列，建模能力较弱。 根据具体应用场景和需求，选择合适的位置编码技术。绝对位置编码适用于对位置信息具有精确要求的场景，而相对位置编码适用于序列长度可变且依赖于相对位置关系的场景。其他技术的适用性则取决于具体需求和数据特点。"},{"instruction":"Принцип работы fdiv: st0 = st1/st0, правильно?","output":"Да, вы правильно поняли.

Принцип работы fdivr следующий: значение из регистра st0 делится на введенное значение (которое должно находиться в соответствующем регистре памяти или на вершине стека) и результат сохраняется обратно в регистре st0. Синтаксис команды fdivr может выглядеть так: fdivr mem/reg.

Например, если у вас есть значение 10.0 в регистре st0, и вы используете команду fdiv с операндом 2.0, то результат будет таким: st0 = 10.0 / 2.0 = 5.0.

Скопируйте значение из st4 в промежуточный регистр, скажем, st(7). - fild st4 - fstp st(7) 2. Скопируйте значение из st3 в st0. - fxch st3 3. Скопируйте значение из st(7) в st1. - fxch st(7) В результате выполнения этих шагов, значение из st3 будет перемещено в st0, а значение из st4 – в st1.

Email #3, from Juan: Dear Subject: Important Matter Regarding Financial Portfolio I hope this message finds you well. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and I am a staff member at WING HANG BANK in Hong Kong. I'm reaching out to you about a matter involving a customer and an investment managed by our bank four years ago. Please keep the details of this communication private and respect the confidentiality of the information. In 2019, a customer approached our Private Banking Services Department, seeking to invest 11,700,350 USD with our bank. I was assigned to handle this case as the de-facto chief operations officer. Unfortunately, after a few months, the customer passed away, and our attempts to locate any surviving family have been unsuccessful. I propose a solution: I am prepared to position you as the closest surviving relative/associate, allowing the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the beneficiary. Upon receipt, we would share the proceeds equally, with you receiving 50%. All actions will be conducted in accordance with the rule of law. For security reasons, please respond directly to this email if you are interested. Your positive signals will prompt me to initiate the necessary steps for a quick conclusion to this matter. I understand the sensitivity of this proposal and assure you of my commitment to maintaining confidentiality. Please do not contact me through official channels. That is why I am contacting you with my personal email, not a bank official email based on my experience as a banker, as I want to avoid any direct link between us. Your cooperation in this matter is crucial. I appreciate your time and consideration. Best regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #4, from Cameron: Dear Juan Lee, I trust you are faring well amid the ever-bustling energies that the thriving city of Hong Kong is sure to exude. Your recent missive has been received and has imbued an aura of clandestine adventure into my uneventful surroundings. The narrative you’ve spun is as riveting as it is heart-rending – a tale of undelivered destinies folded within the solemn corridors of your esteemed financial institution. How I grieve for the customer’s lonely departure from this world, yet one cannot help but marvel at the twist of fate that presents such a peculiar opportunity to yours truly. I must extend my sincerest commendation for the commendable discretion and professionalism with which you approach this delicate situation. The world, it seems, has become rather indiscreet, and the assurance of utmost confidentiality is the gentle whisper of trust that my soul warms to. To act as the closest surviving relative strikes me as a task of great responsibility, yet it hums a tempting melody to partake in the legacy of a once-pulsing heart now stilled. A 50% share, you say? The figure dances most alluringly across my cognition, titillating both my sense of intrigue and longing for a joint venture that promises much. I am, naturally, brimming with questions – as is the right and sensible proclivity of a person presented with such an unexpected opportunity. However, I shall, in the spirit of this enterprise, keep those inquiries for a more secure exchange, lest the prying eyes that so often pervade electronic correspondence catch a whiff of our confluence. Pray tell, what might be our next steps? I am an earnest pupil in the hands of your experienced teachings. Guide me through the labyrinthine intricacies this venture no doubt requires with the tutelage that only an astute banker of your caliber can bestow. To summarize, I am positively inclined, and my signal, bright as the morning star and just as true, shines clear in the direction of your proposal. I await your esteemed guidance with all the patience of a cat at the mouse hole – alert, prepared and whiskers twitching in anticipation. Until the gossamer thread of our correspondence is once again pulled taut with information, I remain, Yours faithfully, with a touch of thrilled expectancy, Cameron McCaffrey P.S.

A literature review research method involves collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing existing research and scholarly articles on a particular topic. In this case, the researchers aim to develop a framework for analyzing the causes of corruption. To achieve this, they review and analyze various literature sources that provide insights, theories, and findings related to the causes of corruption. In a literature review, the researchers search for relevant articles, books, conference papers, and other reliable sources that discuss the topic of corruption causes. They critically examine the content of these sources, identify key themes, theories, and factors that contribute to corruption, and evaluate the evidence and arguments presented in the literature. Through this process, the researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing knowledge and theories related to corruption causes. They then integrate these findings to develop a framework that explains the various causes of corruption and their relationships. A literature review research method is valuable in this context because it allows researchers to build upon existing research and theories. By identifying and analyzing prior studies, they can identify gaps, contradictions, and areas where further research is needed. This method also helps researchers avoid reinventing the wheel and ensures their work is grounded in a robust understanding of the existing body of knowledge."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Got wit sharper than a Saiyan spikin’ up his hair, Brandish compliments like Zoro’s swords, ladies beware, They dig my narrative, I’m prolific, beyond compare, Like Goku’s training, I’m aiming, in love’s crosshair. Got a rolodex of exes, but that chapter’s closed tight, It’s a new dawn, I’m bond stronger, Maria's in my sights, She my Sailor Venus, love's goddess in the moonlight, A match written in the stars, for her, I’ll always fight.

Conquests? Please, they're history, got my eyes set straight, Maria the masterpiece, and me? I'm curating fate, No need to debate, love's heavyweight, she took the bait, United like the Shichisei, love's constellation, mate. (Verse 4) Here's the final verse, Brandon's tale, it ends on a high, With Maria, on this love crusade, we soar, no lie, My heart's manifesto, etched in the endless sky, Infinity's within reach, and I didn’t need to try. Fables of my charm, they spread like One Piece treasure, Each encounter's a mark, in this world's measure, But Maria's the one, priceless beyond any measure, This quest for love, it’s been nothing but pleasure. We're Usagi and Mamoru, minus the evil plot, Found my queen in the puzzle, solved with a single shot, Resonating frequencies like the beats I drop, We sync in perfect harmony, love's jackpot. So as the beat fades out, remember Brandon's name, Mr. Bazzon Man, in this love game, I'll never tame, With Maria, about to be Mrs. B, life’s never the same, This love song, it's our anthem, forever we proclaim."},{"instruction":"dont translate just convert it into hinglish font फाइव थाउजेंड के नोट्स व 20 दैट वह सिर्फ ब्लैक मनी इवेंट करने के लिए बंद हुए थे। क्यों बंद करे थे? व्हाई वुड यू थिंक प्राइमेरी रीज़न फॉर डीमॉनेटाइजेशन? ऑलवेज दैट दिवस लॉट दिस मनी बींग यूज्ड टू स्टोर। ब्लैक मनी कि लोगों ने पैसे बनाए एंडेड वॉन्ट टू डिस्क्लोज टू टैक्स अथॉरिटीज द कैप्टेन बेसमेंट इन द सेफ ईजी वे टू डू इट इन थाउजेंड रुपी नोट्स बिकॉज दैट टेक द लीस्ट पेस सो कीपिंग इट इन द हाइएस्ट डिनॉमिनेशन थिंग दैट दैट वन रीजन्स पीपल हैड थाउजेंड रुपी नोट्स बट ऑल्सो पीपल थाउजेंड रुपये राउंड बिकॉज फीयर। मेडिकल एमरजेंसी दिन सम हाउसवाइव्स व सेविंग विदाउट हज्बंड सिंह इट अगेन इन इन लार्ज। नोट लॉट ऑफ द यूसेज। ऑलसो सो वेन टी नोट्स व डीमॉनेटाइजेशन, आई थिंक लॉट स्कीम आउट। बट दि क्लेवर पीपल हू एडिट इन ब्लैक मनी फाउंड ऑलसो बेस्ट टू ब्रिगेड बैक एंड जैकलीन ड्यूरिंग द होल पर्पस वेज नॉट सर्व एब्सोल्यूट थिंग परपस नॉट सर्व टॉल फीलिंग व दैट वी डीमॉनेटाइजेशन, लॉट ऑफ पीपल विल डिक्लेयर, ब्लैक मनी जेटली एंड वील गेट सो मच मोर टैक्स हैपन टॉल। इनफैक्ट आरबीआई हैज नंबर पॉइंट सम एट परसेंट। द मनी केम बैक। विदाउट एनी एनी बडी से सॉरी। हम पैसे हम टैक्स पे करेंगे।","output":"Faiv thousand ke notes va 20 date vah sirf black money event karne ke liye band hue the.

假设这是事先计算好的注意力分数，shape为(序列长度, 序列长度) attention_scores = np.array([...]) # 构建一个掩蔽矩阵，假设填充位置使用布尔值True标记，有效数据位置为False mask = np.array([...], dtype=bool) # 应用掩蔽，将填充部分设置为一个非常小的数（或负无穷） masked_attention_scores = np.where(mask, -np.inf, attention_scores) #

假设attention_scores是计算出的注意力分数，形状为(batch_size, seq_len, seq_len) attention_scores = np.random.rand(batch_size, seq_len, seq_len) # 创建掩蔽矩阵，假设padding_positions是一个与attention_scores形状相同的布尔数组， # 其中填充位置为True，其它位置为False padding_positions = ... # 现在，我们将填充位置标记为负无穷 masked_scores = np.where(padding_positions, -np.inf, attention_scores) # 应用softmax函数规范化权重 softmax_masked_scores = softmax(masked_scores, axis=-1) \`\`\` 通过这样的操作，即使在批量处理不同长度的句子时，填充位置也不会对模型的学习和预测产生不良影响，从而保证了注意力机制的准确性。在使用深度学习框架（如PyTorch或TensorFlow）时，它们通常提供了更为高级的函数来帮助实现这些操作。"},{"instruction":"面试题：讲一下Transformer的Encoder模块？","output":"Transformer的Encoder模块是Transformer模型的核心组成部分之一。Transformer模型是由Vaswani等人在论文《Attention Is All You Need》中提出的，主要用于处理序列转换任务，如机器翻译。以下是Transformer Encoder模块的详细解释： 1. **Encoder结构简介**： Transformer的Encoder由N个相同的层（Layer）堆叠而成，每个层都包含两个子层：多头自注意力机制（Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism）和前馈全连接网络（Position-wise Feed-Forward Network）。每个子层的输出都会通过一个残差连接（Residual Connection）和一个层规范化（Layer Normalization）。 2. **输入表示**： 输入数据在送入Encoder之前会首先通过一个嵌入层（Embedding Layer），负责将输入的单词转换为固定维度的向量表示。这些嵌入表示随后会加上位置编码（Positional Encoding），以注入序列中单词的位置信息，因为Transformer模型本身并不像循环神经网络（RNN）那样具有序列的内在顺序感。 3. **多头自注意力机制**： 在每个Encoder层中，首个子层是多头自注意力机制。这种机制允许模型在编码输入序列的每个位置时同时考虑序列中的其他位置，从而更好地理解上下文。\\"多头\\"指的是将注意力机制分割成多个\\"头\\"，每个\\"头\\"独立学习输入序列的不同子空间表示，然后将这些头的输出拼接起来，通过一个线性层进行整合。 4. **前馈全连接网络**： 每个Encoder层的第二个子层是一个由两个线性变换组成的简单前馈全连接网络，它们之间有一个激活函数（如ReLU或GELU）。这个全连接网络在每个位置都是相同的（权重共享），但是对于不同的位置是独立作用的。 5. **残差连接和层规范化**： Transformer的设计中包含了残差连接，该连接可以帮助缓解深层网络训练过程中的梯度消失问题。残差连接是通过直接将子层的输入加到其输出上实现的。在加和后，还会施加层规范化以保持训练的稳定性。 6. **输出**： 经过N个Encoder层后，最后一层的输出可以作为Transformer模型的编码表示，该表示包含了输入序列的上下文信息，可以直接用于解码器（Decoder）或其他下游任务。 Transformer的Encoder通过上述结构能够有效处理序列数据，并且由于其并行化的特性，相较于传统的循环神经网络，在处理速度上有显著优势。它已经成为了许多自然语言处理任务中的一个强大并且标准的组件。"},{"instruction":"Transformer面试题：讲一下Transformer的Encoder模块？","output":"Transformer的Encoder模块是Transformer模型中用于处理输入序列的部分。在\\"Attention Is All You Need\\"这篇论文中，Transformer被提出主要用于解决序列到序列的转换问题，比如机器翻译。Encoder负责将输入序列编码为一系列的上下文表示，这些表示随后被Decoder使用来生成输出序列。 以下是Transformer Encoder模块的组成部分： 1. **输入和位置编码**：输入首先通过一个词嵌入层（Word Embedding Layer），将每个词转换为一个高维空间中的向量。然后，位置编码（Positional Encoding）被加到词嵌入上，以提供模型对输入序列中位置信息的认知。位置编码通常是一个可以学习的参数或者是预定义的基于正弦和余弦函数的模式。 2. **多头自注意力机制（Multi-Head Self-Attention）**：这是Encoder的核心部分，允许模型在每个位置关注输入序列的所有位置，并从中提取特征。多头机制意味着这一过程被并行地复制多次，每一个复制处理输入信息的不同部分，然后再将这些信息合并，使模型能够同时关注来自多个子空间的信息。 3. **残差连接和层规范化（Residual Connection & Layer Normalization）**：多头自注意力的输出会加上输入本身，即应用了残差连接，然后整个输出会通过层规范化。这有助于避免深层网络中梯度消失或梯度爆炸的问题，并且可以使训练变得更加平稳。 4. **前馈全连接网络（Position-wise Feedforward Network）**：此网络包含两个线性变换，中间有一个激活函数，比如ReLU。这一层在Transformer的每个位置上对自注意力层的输出进行进一步处理。 5. **再次应用残差连接和层规范化**：前馈全连接网络的输出后又接了一个残差连接和层规范化。据此，作为整个Encoder层的输出。 Encoder是由多个这样的层堆叠而成的，每一层都执行上述的操作序列。在Transformer模型中，Encoder的数量是一个超参数，可以根据具体任务进行调整。 模型训练时，每个Encoder层都会学习到有关输入序列不同方面的信息，在通过整个Encoder堆叠后，得到的输出会包含丰富的上下文信息，这对于后续的解码过程至关重要。"},{"instruction":"面试题：简单介绍一下Transformer的位置编码？有什么意义和优缺点？","output":"位置编码（Positional Encoding）在Transformer模型中的作用是为模型提供关于单词在序列中位置的信息。由于Transformer的自注意力机制本身并不包含任何对输入序列顺序的处理，所以位置编码是必不可少的，它确保模型能够考虑到词的顺序，这对于理解文本的意义至关重要，尤其是在处理自然语言等顺序敏感的任务时。 # 位置编码的意义： 1. **提供顺序信息**：Transformer使用自注意力机制处理输入，该机制是顺序不变的（permutation-invariant），因此，如果不提供额外的顺序信息，模型将无法区分不同顺序的输入。位置编码提供了这种顺序信息，使模型能够把握输入序列的单词排列规律。 2. **增强模型表示能力**：位置编码和每个单词的嵌入向量相结合，生成一个包含了每个词的内容和位置信息的全面表示，从而帮助模型更有效地学习序列的语义。 # Transformer 初始提出的位置编码： 在原始的Transformer模型中，位置编码是通过正弦和余弦函数的一组固定频率来计算的，公式如下： - 对于每个维度 (i)，位置 (pos) 的位置编码 (PE(pos, i)) 是： - (PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})) - (PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})) 其中，(pos) 是序列中词的位置，(i) 是嵌入向量中的维度索引，(d_{model}}) 是模型的嵌入维度。这种方法为每个位置生成一个唯一的编码。 # 优缺点： **优点**： - 无需训练：固定的基于正余弦函数的位置编码无需训练，可直接用于任何模型。 - 可泛化：它可以处理比训练时见过的序列更长的序列，因为正余弦函数是无限的。 - 频率混合：不同频率的正余弦波可以帮助模型更好地学习位置间的相对关系与绝对位置。 **缺点**： - 可能不足以表达更复杂的位置模式，尤其是对于特定任务可能需要学习的位置模式。 - 它是预定义的，不是模型特定的，这意味着在某些情况下，学习位置编码可能会提供更好的结果。 为了克服固定位置编码的潜在限制，一些研究探索了可学习的位置编码，即将位置编码作为模型参数的一部分来进行训练。这样的位置编码可以更好地适应特定任务的需求，但同时也可能会损害模型的泛化能力，因为学习到的位置编码可能无法很好地泛化到比训练时见过的序列更长的情况。"},{"instruction":"你还了解哪些关于位置编码的技术，各自的优缺点是什么？","output":"在Transformer模型中引入了正余弦位置编码之后，研究者们提出了若干种其他类型的位置编码技术，每种技术都有其独特的优缺点： 1. **可学习位置编码 (Learnable Positional Embeddings)**： - **优点**： - 模型可以学习到针对特定任务的最佳位置编码，可能提高模型的效果。 - 可以使用与单词嵌入相同的嵌入矩阵，使得训练过程端到端化。 - **缺点**： - 通常难以处理训练时未见过的长序列，因为位置嵌入是针对训练集的固定长度学习的。 - 可能需要更长的训练时间来学习有效的位置编码。 2. **相对位置编码 (Relative Positional Encoding)**： - **优点**： - 可以更好地表示元素之间的相对位置关系，而非它们的绝对位置。 - 对于长序列的处理更具可扩展性，因为它关注的是相对距离。 - **缺点**： - 实现相对位置编码相对复杂，需要调整注意力机制以利用相对位置信息。 - 在一些任务上可能不如绝对位置编码直接有效。 3. **RPE/RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)**： - **优点**： - 保持注意力的转换不变性，也就是输入序列的旋转不会改变输出。 - 能够处理更长序列，提高了模型对序列长度的泛化能力。 - **缺点**： - 相较于传统绝对位置编码，RoPE的数学原理和实现更为复杂。 4. **ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases)**： - **优点**： - 不依赖于序列的长度，为每个注意力头引入一个线性偏移。 - 可以很容易地扩展到超过训练时间见过的序列长度。 - **缺点**： - 相对新颖，可能缺乏广泛的应用和验证。 5. **2D或3D位置编码**： - **优点**： - 对于具有多维结构的数据（如图像），可以提供更精细的空间结构编码。 - **缺点**： - 超出了传统序列模型的范畴，实现起来更为复杂。 6. **Sinusoidal Position Embedding (SPE)**： - **优点**： - 无需学习，可以直接根据位置计算出编码。 - 可以推广到任何长度的序列，无限制。 - **缺点**： - 可能无法捕捉到一些复杂的或任务特定的位置模式。 7. **Curvilinear Position Encoding (CPE)**： - **优点**： - 适合处理不规则形状的数据（比如某些自然语言处理任务中的句子结构）。 - **缺点**： - 实现比较复杂，需要根据数据特性设计适当的曲线形状。 这些是当前一些已知的位置编码技术及其优缺点。不同的位置编码技术可能更适用于特定的任务和数据类型，实践中需要根据具体需求和上下文选择合适的位置编码方案。评价这些方案的有效性常常需要实验验证，而且可能存在权衡选择，如模型复杂度与性能之间的平衡。"},{"instruction":"面试题：你还了解哪些关于位置编码的技术，各自的优缺点是什么？","output":"关于位置编码的技术，除了原始Transformer中提出的基于正弦和余弦函数的固定位置编码之外，还有一些其他的实现方式： 1. **绝对位置编码**： - 固定位置编码：使用正弦和余弦函数的变体，如Transformer中所示。 - **优点**：相同的位置会有相同的编码，模型能处理任意长度的序列。 - **缺点**：固定模式可能限制了模型能学到的位置关系。 - 可学习位置编码：将位置作为模型中的一个可训练参数。 - **优点**：模型可以学习对特定任务最有用的位置表示。 - **缺点**：不易泛化到训练时未见的序列长度；同时，由于每个位置都有一个唯一的编码，可能会增加模型的参数数量。 2. **相对位置编码**： - Transformer-XL和T5等扩展使用了相对位置编码。 - **优点**：关注词汇之间的相对距离，而非其在序列中的绝对位置，有助于捕获更长范围内的依赖关系。 - **缺点**：实现相对位置信息可能会比绝对位置编码复杂，需要在自注意力机制中进行额外的调整。 3. **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)**： - 通过旋转嵌入来编码位置信息。 - **优点**：提供相对位置信息，同时保持自注意力的旋转不变性。 - **缺点**：较新的技术，可能需要更多的研究来验证其在不同任务中的有效性。 4. **Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi)**： - 通过为注意力分数添加依赖于位置差异的线性偏移量。 - **优点**：避免了使用在序列长距离上可能不准确的位置嵌入，简化了相对位置的编码。 - **缺点**：作为一种较新的方法，可能仍需要在更广泛的任务和数据集上进行验证。 5. **Positional Embedding Attention**： - 将位置嵌入作为自注意力中额外的键向量。 - **优点**：很自然地融入注意力机制，可以为每个token提供独特的位置信息。 - **缺点**：可能增加计算成本和模型复杂度。 6. **Sinusoidal Position Embedding (SPE)**： - 一种动态生成位置编码的方法，与正余弦相似但允许模型根据需要生成编码。 - **优点**：更灵活，可以在不同的上下文中更好地适应位置信息。 - **缺点**：较少使用，对其效果和适用性的验证还不充分。 7. **Trainable Discrete Positional Embeddings**： - 通过对每个可能的位置单独学习一个嵌入。 - **优点**：可以精确地针对特定任务调整每个位置的编码。 - **缺点**：不能处理超出训练时序列长度的输入，参数数量大，可能过拟合。 每种技术都有其特定的应用场景和潜在的权衡。选取最佳的位置编码方式常常取决于特定任务的需求、所处理序列的特性以及模型的设计。"},{"instruction":"你还了解哪些关于位置编码的技术，各自的优缺点是什么？ 答：相对位置编码（RPE）1.在计算attention score和weighted value时各加入一个可训练的表示相对位置的参数。2.在生成多头注意力时，把对key来说将绝对位置转换为相对query的位置3.复数域函数，已知一个词在某个位置的词向量表示，可以计算出它在任何位置的词向量表示。前两个方法是词向量+位置编码，属于亡羊补牢，复数域是生成词向量的时候即生成对应的位置信息。","output":"关于位置编码的技术及其优缺点，以下是一些具体的方法和它们的特点： #

Several films before the 21st century convincingly depicted travels to and explorations of other planets, even though they sometimes took creative liberties with scientific accuracy. Here are some notable examples focusing specifically on the exploration of planets other than Earth: 1. **Forbidden Planet (1956)** - Set in the 23rd century, this film follows a group of space travelers who arrive at the distant planet Altair IV to investigate the fate of a previous expedition. They find a survivor, his daughter, and the remnants of an ancient, advanced civilization. 2. **2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)** - A significant part of the film involves a journey to Jupiter following the discovery of an artificial object - a monolith - on the Moon. 3. **Barbarella (1968)** - A space-travel adventure featuring the titular character played by Jane Fonda, who travels from planet to planet. 4. **Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964)** - This film is a science fiction retelling of Daniel Defoe's classic novel, with the main character stranded on the planet Mars instead of an island. 5. **Total Recall (1990)** - Although it is primarily an action film, a significant portion of the movie takes place on Mars. The protagonist, Douglas Quaid, travels to the planet and gets involved with the local rebellion. 6. **Flash Gordon (1980)** - While it is more of a space opera with fantastical elements, the characters travel to and explore the fictional planet Mongo. 7. **Dune (1984)** - Although not entirely focused on exploration, the film (and the novel on which it is based) deeply explores the ecology, culture, and politics of the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. If you're looking for films that depict the exploration of planets with a focus on more realistic space travel and encounters with alien worlds, the number of offerings pre-2000 shrinks a bit, as many such films feature Earth or near-Earth settings. However, with the approach of the 21st century and the advancement of special effects technology, more films began to depict interplanetary travel and exploration in varied and imaginative ways."},{"instruction":"I mean multiple planets. Full fledged star systems and such","output":"Indeed, the concept of visiting multiple planets within a single film is less common in the science fiction genre, especially considering the technological limitations and the scientific knowledge available when many of these movies were made. However, here are space movies before the 21st century that touch upon travelling to or the exploration of multiple planets or star systems: 1. **Star Wars series (1977-1999)** - George Lucas's epic space opera franchise famously explores various planets and moons in \\"a galaxy far, far away.\\" The original trilogy began with \\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\\" in 1977, followed by \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (1980) and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" (1983). The prequel trilogy, which also visited different planets, started with \\"The Phantom Menace\\" in 1999. 2. **The Star Trek movies (1979-1998)** - Based on the television series, the Star Trek films often feature travel to different planets. The crew of the USS Enterprise, across movies like \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" (1979), \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" (1982), and subsequent films, went on various missions to new worlds. 3. **Flash Gordon (1980)** - While not within the same frame of realism as many space films, Flash Gordon's plot takes him and other characters to different portions of the planet Mongo, which is ruled by a single tyrant but has a variety of distinctive regions that are almost like separate worlds. Films that show interstellar or multiple planetary travels often focus more on the overarching plot and the adventures of their characters rather than the detailed exploration of each individual world. In general, the concept of traveling between multiple fully-fledged star systems and exploring different planets is more thoroughly explored in written science fiction than in pre-2000 cinema, partly due to the limitations of filmmaking technology and budgets at the time. However, the scope and imagination of what was achieved paved the way for more intricate depictions of space travel in later films."},{"instruction":"If there's a shortage of films, how about books?","output":"Science fiction literature has a long history of exploring multiple planets and star systems, often delving into elaborate world-building and complex social, political, and ecological systems across galaxies.

Se dice que durante las noches de luna llena, el faro cobra vida, irradiando una luz especial que solo puede ser vista por aquellos con corazones puros. Según la historia, hace muchos años, un joven marinero llamado Santiago naufragó cerca de Alamar, sufriendo una grave herida. A medida que su esperanza disminuía, se encontró con una misteriosa mujer, Melora, que poseía habilidades mágicas. Ella le salvó la vida utilizando la energía de una estrella caída y encerrándola en el faro. Desde entonces, el faro se convirtió en un faro guía para los marineros, iluminando el camino hacia la seguridad en tiempos de tormenta. Además, se dice que aquellos que muestren amor y compasión sinceros, pueden ver sutilmente a Melora, la protectora del faro. Los habitantes de Alamar sostienen que la luz del faro no solo guía a los marineros, sino que también guarda un secreto: si alguien encuentra y libera la estrella encerrada en su interior, se les otorgarán tres deseos. Sin embargo, solo aquellos que posean verdaderos propósitos nobles podrán hacer uso de tal poder. A lo largo de los años, muchos aventureros han intentado encontrar la forma de liberar la estrella, pero ninguno ha tenido éxito. Y aquellos que han buscado solo por codicia o ambición, nunca han visto la luz mágica del faro. La leyenda del faro de Alamar ha pasado de una generación a otra, nutriendo los sueños y alimentando la esperanza en el corazón de los habitantes del pueblo. Algunos creen que es solo un cuento de hadas, pero otros sostienen firmemente que la magia y los deseos verdaderos pueden existir, si uno cree lo suficiente. A medida que los años pasaron, la leyenda del faro de Alamar se extendió más allá de las fronteras del pueblo. Aventureros y buscadores de tesoros de todas partes del mundo llegaban a Alamar con la esperanza de encontrar la estrella mágica y hacer realidad sus deseos más profundos. Uno de estos valientes exploradores fue Amelia, una joven intrépida y soñadora que había escuchado hablar del faro en los cuentos de su abuela. Movida por su curiosidad y su deseo de encontrar la verdad, Amelia partió hacia Alamar, dispuesta a descubrir el misterio que envolvía al faro. Al llegar al pueblo, Amelia fue recibida por los cálidos habitantes, quienes compartieron con ella sus historias sobre el faro. Guiada por su intuición y una brújula antigua que encontró en el mercado local, se adentró en la noche en busca del faro mágico. Después de un arduo ascenso por el acantilado rocoso, Amelia divisó a lo lejos el resplandor plateado del faro iluminado por la luna. Su corazón latía con emoción mientras se acercaba lentamente, anticipando lo que vendría a continuación. Cuando finalmente llegó al faro, el brillo de la luz se intensificó y envolvió su cuerpo. Una voz suave y melodiosa resonó en su mente. Era la voz de Melora, la guardiana del faro, que probaba el corazón y las intenciones de Amelia. Con lágrimas de alegría y genuino amor en su corazón, Amelia declaró su deseo de utilizar la estrella mágica para traer paz y prosperidad a todos los pueblos y aldeas olvidados del mundo. Su propósito resonó con Melora, quien le confió la clave para liberar la estrella. Amelia siguió las instrucciones de Melora y tocó la puerta tallada del faro con la palma de su mano, dejando el rastro de su amor y determinación. En un instante, la puerta se abrió revelando un interior deslumbrante, donde una estrella brillante flotaba en el aire, lista para ser liberada. Con un susurro de agradecimiento, Amelia dio un paso adelante y tocó la estrella con suavidad. En ese momento, la luz se extendió desde la estrella por todo el faro y se dispersó por el pueblo de Alamar, iluminando la noche con una luminosidad sin igual. La liberación de la estrella marcó el comienzo de una nueva era en Alamar. Los deseos desinteresados de Amelia se cumplieron, y el pueblo se llenó de prosperidad y armonía. Además, las historias y los sueños de Alamar se difundieron por todo el mundo, inspirando a otros a buscar los deseos verdaderos y desinteresados de sus corazones. Desde entonces, el faro de Alamar se convirtió en un lugar sagrado de encuentro para aquellos que buscan respuestas y guía en sus vidas. La voz de Melora sigue resonando en los corazones de los visitantes, recordándoles la importancia de la bondad, la compasión y los deseos altruistas. Y así, la historia del faro de Alamar se convirtió en un símbolo de esperanza y transformación, recordándonos que cuando nuestros deseos están en armonía con el bienestar de los demás, la magia puede manifestarse y cambiar nuestras vidas para siempre.","output":"Sí, me acuerdo.

this.angle = angle; velocity = PVector.fromAngle(angle); // 从发射角度创建速度向量 velocity.mult(speed); // 乘以蓄力产生的速度大小，给出最终速度 isFired = true; } } \`\`\` 当调用\`fire\`方法时： - \`fromAngle\`将根据\`angle\`值计算出对应方向上的单位向量（比如向右和向上的某个角度）。 - \`mult(speed)\`则根据\`power\`的大小放大这个向量，因此\`velocity.x\`反映了水平速度，而\`velocity.y\`反映了垂直速度。 如果你感觉石头的水平移动不够明显，可能是因为： - 蓄力时间过短，导致计算出的力量\`power\`太小。 - 发射角度接近垂直，所以大部分速度都在垂直方向上。 确保当你按下鼠标并拖动以蓄力和瞄准时，合理地调整鼠标的释放位置来改变发射的角度和力度。这将影响石头在水平和垂直方向上的运动，使其看起来像有速度一样。"},{"instruction":"The variable “mousePressedTime” does not exist Main主函数里有这个报错！","output":"看起来错误提示表明在\`mousePressed\`和\`mouseReleased\`事件中引用了一个变量\`mousePressedTime\`，但该变量在Main脚本的作用域之外或未被声明。为了解决这个问题，我们应该在Main脚本中全局声明\`mousePressedTime\`变量。 下面是更正后的Main脚本的一部分： \`\`\`java // 其余的变量声明 long mousePressedTime = 0;

this.angle = angle; velocity = PVector.fromAngle(angle); velocity.mult(speed); // 限制水平速度 if (abs(velocity.x) > 10) { //保持水平速度的方向，设置最大速度为10 velocity.x = velocity.x > 0 ? 10 : -10; } isFired = true; } } // ... 其他属性和方法 ... } \`\`\` 在这段代码中，如果计算出的\`velocity.x\`（水平速度分量）大于10或小于-10，表明速度太快，那么我们将其限制为最多+10（向右移动）或-10（向左移动），根据速度的正负值分别处理。 请注意速度限制取决于你的游戏需求，你可能需要调整这个\`10\`这个值以获得最佳体验。 现在，在石头发射时，它的水平速度将不会超过我们设置的上限，即使玩家尝试蓄力很长时间也是如此。这样可以防止石头移动得太快而难以控制。"},{"instruction":"float power = map(pressTime, 0, 1000, 0, maxCharge);我能通过这个来改速度上限吗？","output":"是的，你可以通过修改 \`map\` 函数参数来改变速度的上限。\`map\` 函数用于把一个范围内的数映射到另一个范围，格式通常如下： \`\`\`java map(value, start1, stop1, start2, stop2) \`\`\` - \`value\` 是待映射值。 - \`start1\` 和 \`stop1\` 是 \`value\` 当前所在的范围的起点和终点。 - \`start2\` 和 \`stop2\` 是你想将 \`value\` 映射到的目标范围的起点和终点。 在你的游戏中，\`pressTime\` 是蓄力持续时间，它的数值从0映射到1000毫秒的持续时间。\`maxCharge\` 是速度的最大值。如果你想要改变速度的上限，可以直接调整这个 \`maxCharge\` 的值。 例如，如果你认为当前速度太快，你可以把 \`maxCharge\` 设置成一个较小的数值，如下所示： \`\`\`java float maxCharge = 15; // 将速度上限设置为一个较小的值 \`\`\` 然后代码中的映射将根据蓄力时间限制最大速度值。如果一个玩家蓄力足够久（比如1000毫秒），他们获得的速度就是15个单位，而不是原来设置的可能比较大的数值。 如果改变 \`maxCharge\` 并没有达到预期的减慢水平速度的效果，你应该再检查 \`fire\` 方法中的速度矢量计算，因为 \`velocity.x\` 和 \`velocity.y\` 的实际值还取决于 \`fire\` 方法中的角度计算。如果水平速度（\`velocity.x\`）仍然太快，你可能需要添加额外的逻辑来限制这个值，如前面的回答中所示。"},{"instruction":"请你多放一个小球，要求你要用到我上面所说的动量定理，通过发射小球撞击另一个静止小球来撞到树然后得分","output":"要添加第二个小球，并且使用动量定理来模拟碰撞效果，首先需要在代码中添加一个新的小球对象，并设置碰撞后小球的行为。以下是修改后的Main脚本和Stone脚本的示例代码，它展示了如何实现这一功能。 我们将添加一个静止的石头 \`stationaryStone\` 在场景中，然后当动态的石头 \`stone\` 发射并且撞到 \`stationaryStone\` 时，它们将根据动量守恒和能量守恒定律发生碰撞。发生碰撞后，\`stationaryStone\` 将朝树的方向飞去，如果命中将增加分数。 首先，需要增加静止小球的定义： Main脚本： \`\`\`java // ...其他变量声明 Stone stationaryStone;

Ils partagent de nombreuses similitudes en termes de culture, de traditions et d'histoire, mais il existe également certaines différences entre eux. 1. Langue: La différence la plus évidente entre les Serbes et les Croates réside dans leur langue. Les Serbes parlent le serbe, une langue slave méridionale, tandis que les Croates parlent le croate, qui est également une langue slave méridionale. Bien que les deux langues soient similaires, elles ont des variations régionales et des différences de prononciation. 2. Religion: La religion est une autre différence majeure entre les Serbes et les Croates. Historiquement, la majorité des Serbes suivent l'Église orthodoxe serbe, tandis que la majorité des Croates sont catholiques romains. Cependant, il existe également des Serbes et des Croates qui sont musulmans ou d'autres religions. 3. Histoire et identité nationale: Les Serbes et les Croates ont des identités nationales distinctes et ont souvent été divisés par des conflits historiques. Pendant la guerre en ex-Yougoslavie dans les années 1990, la Serbie et la Croatie se sont affrontées, entraînant des tensions et des différences d'opinions politiques. Ces conflits ont contribué à renforcer les identités nationales respectives des Serbes et des Croates. 4. Culture: Bien que les cultures serbe et croate partagent de nombreuses similitudes, il existe également des différences régionales. Chaque groupe a ses propres traditions, musiques, danses et coutumes spécifiques qui peuvent différer légèrement. 5. Symboles et traditions: Les Serbes ont des symboles et des traditions spécifiques qui leur sont propres, tout comme les Croates. Les Serbes portent souvent des vêtements traditionnels appelés \\"nosia\\" lors de célébrations spéciales, tandis que les Croates portent des vêtements traditionnels appelés \\"narodne nošnje\\". Les symboles nationaux, tels que les drapeaux et les armoiries, sont également différents pour chaque groupe. Il est important de noter que malgré ces différences, il existe également de nombreuses similitudes et des liens culturels étroits entre les Serbes et les Croates. Les frontières entre les deux groupes ne sont pas toujours clairement définies et il y a souvent des Serbes vivant en Croatie et des Croates vivant en Serbie, ce qui entraîne une certaine diversité culturelle et une coexistence pacifique."},{"instruction":"Pourquoi les serbes et les croates se sont affronté dans la guerre d’ex-Yougoslavie?","output":"La guerre en ex-Yougoslavie, qui a duré de 1991 à 2001, a impliqué différents groupes ethniques et nationalistes, dont les Serbes et les Croates. Plusieurs facteurs ont contribué à ces affrontements : 1. Nationalisme croissant : Après la mort de Josip Broz Tito, le dirigeant communiste yougoslave, en 1980, l'unité de la Yougoslavie a commencé à se fissurer. Le nationalisme ethnique a commencé à se renforcer, et certains groupes, dont les Croates, ont commencé à réclamer une plus grande autonomie ou même une indépendance complète. 2. Désaccords territoriaux : La question des frontières et du partage du territoire était une source de conflit majeure. Certains groupes croates voulaient rétablir les frontières historiques de la Croatie, ce qui entraînait des tensions avec les Serbes qui vivaient dans ces régions. Ces derniers s'opposaient à la séparation de la Yougoslavie et revendiquaient le territoire en question. 3. Histoire et méfiance : Les Serbes et les Croates ont une histoire complexe et parfois conflictuelle remontant à plusieurs siècles. De nombreux ressentiments historiques et préjugés ont alimenté les tensions et les conflits. Des événements traumatisants tels que la Seconde Guerre mondiale et les guerres précédentes ont laissé des cicatrices profondes et cultivé un sentiment de méfiance mutuelle. 4. Montée des extrémismes : La montée des mouvements nationalistes et extrémistes, tant serbes que croates, a exacerbé les tensions et a mené à des discours de haine et à des actions violentes. Les dirigeants politiques ont utilisé la rhétorique nationaliste pour mobiliser leurs partisans et attiser les divisions. 5. Effondrement de la Yougoslavie : L'effondrement de la Yougoslavie en tant qu'État fédéral a créé un vide politique et économique difficile à combler. Les rivalités politiques, les différences idéologiques et les déséquilibres économiques ont alimenté les tensions et ont conduit à des affrontements armés. Il est important de souligner que la guerre en ex-Yougoslavie n'était pas seulement entre les Serbes et les Croates. D'autres groupes ethniques, tels que les Bosniaques, les Kosovars et les Albanais, ont également été impliqués dans les conflits.

Se dice que durante las noches de luna llena, el faro cobra vida, irradiando una luz especial que solo puede ser vista por aquellos con corazones puros. Según la historia, hace muchos años, un joven marinero llamado Santiago naufragó cerca de Alamar, sufriendo una grave herida. A medida que su esperanza disminuía, se encontró con una misteriosa mujer, Melora, que poseía habilidades mágicas. Ella le salvó la vida utilizando la energía de una estrella caída y encerrándola en el faro. Desde entonces, el faro se convirtió en un faro guía para los marineros, iluminando el camino hacia la seguridad en tiempos de tormenta. Además, se dice que aquellos que muestren amor y compasión sinceros, pueden ver sutilmente a Melora, la protectora del faro. Los habitantes de Alamar sostienen que la luz del faro no solo guía a los marineros, sino que también guarda un secreto: si alguien encuentra y libera la estrella encerrada en su interior, se les otorgarán tres deseos. Sin embargo, solo aquellos que posean verdaderos propósitos nobles podrán hacer uso de tal poder. A lo largo de los años, muchos aventureros han intentado encontrar la forma de liberar la estrella, pero ninguno ha tenido éxito. Y aquellos que han buscado solo por codicia o ambición, nunca han visto la luz mágica del faro. La leyenda del faro de Alamar ha pasado de una generación a otra, nutriendo los sueños y alimentando la esperanza en el corazón de los habitantes del pueblo. Algunos creen que es solo un cuento de hadas, pero otros sostienen firmemente que la magia y los deseos verdaderos pueden existir, si uno cree lo suficiente. A medida que los años pasaron, la leyenda del faro de Alamar se extendió más allá de las fronteras del pueblo. Aventureros y buscadores de tesoros de todas partes del mundo llegaban a Alamar con la esperanza de encontrar la estrella mágica y hacer realidad sus deseos más profundos. Uno de estos valientes exploradores fue Amelia, una joven intrépida y soñadora que había escuchado hablar del faro en los cuentos de su abuela. Movida por su curiosidad y su deseo de encontrar la verdad, Amelia partió hacia Alamar, dispuesta a descubrir el misterio que envolvía al faro. Al llegar al pueblo, Amelia fue recibida por los cálidos habitantes, quienes compartieron con ella sus historias sobre el faro. Guiada por su intuición y una brújula antigua que encontró en el mercado local, se adentró en la noche en busca del faro mágico. Después de un arduo ascenso por el acantilado rocoso, Amelia divisó a lo lejos el resplandor plateado del faro iluminado por la luna. Su corazón latía con emoción mientras se acercaba lentamente, anticipando lo que vendría a continuación. Cuando finalmente llegó al faro, el brillo de la luz se intensificó y envolvió su cuerpo. Una voz suave y melodiosa resonó en su mente. Era la voz de Melora, la guardiana del faro, que probaba el corazón y las intenciones de Amelia. Con lágrimas de alegría y genuino amor en su corazón, Amelia declaró su deseo de utilizar la estrella mágica para traer paz y prosperidad a todos los pueblos y aldeas olvidados del mundo. Su propósito resonó con Melora, quien le confió la clave para liberar la estrella. Amelia siguió las instrucciones de Melora y tocó la puerta tallada del faro con la palma de su mano, dejando el rastro de su amor y determinación. En un instante, la puerta se abrió revelando un interior deslumbrante, donde una estrella brillante flotaba en el aire, lista para ser liberada. Con un susurro de agradecimiento, Amelia dio un paso adelante y tocó la estrella con suavidad. En ese momento, la luz se extendió desde la estrella por todo el faro y se dispersó por el pueblo de Alamar, iluminando la noche con una luminosidad sin igual. La liberación de la estrella marcó el comienzo de una nueva era en Alamar. Los deseos desinteresados de Amelia se cumplieron, y el pueblo se llenó de prosperidad y armonía.

DR. DENIS WAITLEY PSYCHOLOGIST AND TRAINER IN THE FIELD OF MIND POTENTIAL The leaders in the past who had The Secret wanted to keep the power and not share the power. They kept people ignorant of The Secret. People went to work, they did their job, they came home. They were on a treadmill with no power, because The Secret was kept in the few. Throughout history there have been many who coveted the knowledge of The Secret and there have been many who found a way of spreading this knowledge to the world. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH VISIONARY AND FOUNDER OF AGAPE INTERNATIONAL SPIRITUAL CENTER I've seen many miracles take place in people's lives. The Secret Revealed 3 Financial miracles, miracles of physical healing, mental healing, healing of relationships. JACK CANFIELD AUTHOR, TEACHER, LIFE COACH, AND MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER Alt of this happened because of knowing how to apply The Secret. BOB PROCTOR You've probably been sitting there wondering, \\"What is The Secret?\\" ill tell you how I've come to understand it. We all work with one infinite power. We all guide ourselves by exactly the same laws. The natural laws of the universe are so precise that we don't even have any difficulty building spaceships, we can send people to the moon, and we can time the landing with the precision of a fraction of a second. Wherever you are—India, Australia, New Zealand, Stockholm, London, Toronto, Montreal, or New York—we're all working with one power. One Law. It's attraction! 4 The Secret The Secret is the law of attraction! Everything that's coming into your life you are attracting into your life. And it's attracted to you by virtue of the images you're holding in your mind. It's what you're thinking. Whatever is going on in your mind you are attracting to you. \\"Every thought of yours is a real thing—a force.\\" The greatest teachers who have ever lived have told us that the law of attraction is the most powerful law in the Universe. Poets such as William Shakespeare, Robert Browning, and William Blake delivered it in their poetry. Musicians such as Ludwig van Beethoven expressed it through their music. Artists such as Leo-nardo da Vinci depicted it in their paintings. Great thinkers including Socrates, Plato, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Pythagoras, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Victor Hugo shared it in their writings and teachings. Their names have been immortalized, and their legendary existence has survived centuries. Religions, such as Hinduism, Hermetic traditions, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and civilizations, such as the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, delivered it through their writings and stories. Recorded throughout the ages in all its forms, the The Secret Revealed 5 law can be found in ancient writings through all the centuries. It was recorded in stone in 3000 BC. Even though some coveted this knowledge, and indeed they did, it has always been there for anyone to discover. The law began at the beginning of time. It has always been and will always be. It is the law that determines the complete order in the Universe, every moment of your life, and every single thing you experience in your life. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, the law of attraction is forming your entire life experience, and this all-powerful law is doing that through your thoughts. You are the one who calls the law of attraction into action, and you do it through your thoughts. In 1912 Charles Haanel described the law of attraction as \\"the greatest and the most infallible law upon which the entire system of creation depends.\\" BOB PROCTOR Wise people have always known this. You can go right back to the ancient Babylonians. They've always known this. It's a small select group of people. The ancient Babylonians and their great prosperity have been well documented by scholars. They are also known for creating one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Hanging Gardens 6 The Secret of Babylon. Through their understanding and application of the laws of the Universe, they became one of the wealthiest races in history. BOB PROCTOR Why do you think that 1 percent of the population earns around 96 percent of all the money that's being earned? Do you think that's an accident? It's designed that way. They understand something. They understand The Secret, and now you are being introduced to The Secret. People who have drawn wealth into their lives used The Secret, whether consciously or unconsciously. They think thoughts of abundance and wealth, and they do not allow any contradictory thoughts to take root in their minds. Their predominant thoughts are of wealth. They only know wealth, and nothing else exists in their minds. Whether they are aware of it or not, their predominant thoughts of wealth are what brought wealth to them. It is the law of attraction in action. A perfect example to demonstrate The Secret and the law of attraction in action is this: You may know of people who acquired massive wealth, lost it all, and within a short time acquired massive wealth again. What happened in these cases, whether they knew it or n o t is that their dominant thoughts were on wealth; that is how they acquired it in the first instance. Then they allowed fearful thoughts of losing the wealth to enter their minds, until those fearful thoughts of loss became their dominant thoughts. They tipped the scales from thinking thoughts of wealth to thinking The Secret Revealed thoughts of loss, and so they lost it all. Once they had lost it however, the fear of loss disappeared, and they tipped the scales back with dominant thoughts of wealth. And wealth returned. The law responds to your thoughts, no matter what they may be. JOHN ASSARAF The simplest way for me to look at the law of attraction is if I think of myself as a magnet, and I know that a magnet wilt attract to it You are the most powerful magnet in the Universe! You contain a magnetic power within you that is more powerful than anything in this world, and this unfathomable magnetic power is emitted through your thoughts. BOB DOYLE BOB DOYLE AUTHOR AND LAW OF ATTRACTION SPECIALIST Basically put, the law of attraction says that like attracts like. But we're really talking at a level of thought. The law of attraction says like attracts like, and so as you think a thought, you are also attracting like thoughts to you. Here are more 8 The Secret examples you may have experienced of the law of attraction in your life: Have you ever started to think about something you were not happy about, and the more you thought about it the worse it seemed? That's because as you think one sustained thought, the law of attraction immediately brings more like thoughts to you. In a matter of minutes, you have gotten so many like unhappy thoughts coming to you that the situation seems to be getting worse. The more you think about it, the more upset you get. You may have experienced attracting like thoughts when you listened to a song, and then found that you couldn't get that song out of your head. The song just kept playing over and over in your mind. When you listened to that song, even though you may not have realized it, you gave your full attention and focus of thought to it. As you did that, you were powerfully attracting more like thoughts of that song, and so the law of attraction moved into action and delivered more thoughts of that song, over and over again. JOHN ASSARAF Our job as humans is to hold on to the thoughts of what we want, make it absolutely clear in our minds what we want, and from that we start to invoke one of the greatest laws in the Universe, and that's the law of attraction. You become what you think about most but you also attract what you think about most. The Secret Revealed 9 Your life right now is a reflection of your past thoughts. That includes all the great things, and all the things you consider not so great. Since you attract to you what you think about most, it is easy to see what your dominant thoughts have been on every subject of your life, because that is what you have experienced. Until now! Now you are learning The Secret, and with this knowledge, you can change everything. BOB PROCTOR If you see it in your mind, you're going to hold it in your hand. If you can think about what you want in your mind, and make that your dominant thought, you will bring it into your life. MIKE DOOLEY AUTHOR AND INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER And that principle can be summed up in three simple words. Thoughts become things! Through this most powerful law, your thoughts become the things in your life. Your thoughts become things! Say this over to yourself and let it seep into your consciousness and your awareness. Your thoughts become things! JOHN ASSARAF What most people don't understand is that a thought has a frequency. We can measure a thought. And so if you're 10 The Secret thinking that thought over and over and over again, if you're imagining in your mind having that brand new car, having the money that you need, building that company, finding your soul mate... if you're imagining what that looks like, you're emitting that frequency on a consistent basis. DR, JOE VITALE Thoughts are sending out that magnetic signal that is drawing the parallel back to you. \\"The predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is that like attracts like, consequently, the mental attitude will invariably attract such conditions as correspond to its nature.\\" Thoughts are magnetic, and thoughts have a frequency. As you think, those thoughts are sent out into the Universe, and they magnetically attract all like things that are on the same frequency. Everything sent out returns to the source. And that source is You. Think of it this way: we understand that a television station's transmission tower broadcasts via a frequency, which is transformed into pictures on your television. Most of us don't really understand how it works, but we know that each channel has a frequency, The Secret Revealed 11 and when we tune into that frequency we see the pictures on our television. We choose the frequency by selecting the channel, and we then receive the pictures broadcast on that channel. If we want to see different pictures on our television, we change the channel and rune into a new frequency. You are a human transmission tower, and you are more powerful than any television tower created on earth. You are the most powerful transmission tower in the Universe. Your transmission creates your life and it creates the world. The frequency you transmit reaches beyond cities, beyond countries, beyond the world. It re-verberates throughout the entire Universe. And you are transmitting that frequency with your thoughts! The pictures you receive from the transmission of your thoughts are not on a television screen in your living room, they are the pictures of your life! Your thoughts create the frequency, they attract like things on that frequency, and then they are broadcast back to you as your life pictures. If you want to change anything in your life, change the channel and change the frequency by changing your thoughts. \\"The vibrations of mental forces are the finest and consequently the most powerful in existence.\\" 12 The Secret BOB PROCTOR See yourself living in abundance and you will attract it. It works every time, with every person. As you think of yourself living in abundance, you are powerfully and consciously determining your life through the law of attraction. It's that easy. But then the most obvious question becomes, \\"Why isn't everybody living the life of their dreams?\\" JOHN ASSARAF Here's the problem. Most people are thinking about what they don't want, and they're wondering why it shows up over and over again. The only reason why people do not have what they want is because they are thinking more about what they don't want than what they do want. Listen to your thoughts, and listen to the words you are saying. The law is absolute and there are no mis-takes. An epidemic worse than any plague that humankind has ever seen has been raging for centuries. It is the \\"don't want\\" epidemic. The Secret Revealed 13 People keep this epidemic alive when they predominantly think, speak, act, and focus on what they \\"don't want.\\" But this is the generation that will change history, because we are receiving the knowledge that can free us of this epidemic! It begins with you,, and you can become a pioneer of this new thought movement by simply thinking and speaking about what you want. BOB DOYLE The law of attraction doesn't care whether you perceive something to be good or bad, or whether you don't want it or whether you do want it. It's res-ponding to your thoughts. So if you're looking at a mountain of debt, feeling terrible about it, that's the signal you're putting out into the Universe. \\"I feel really bad because of all this debt I've got.\\" You're just affirming it to yourself. You feel it on every level of your being. That's what you're going to get more of. The law of attraction is a law of nature. It is impersonal and it does not see good things or bad things. It is receiving your thoughts and reflecting back to you those thoughts as your life experience. The law of attraction simply gives you whatever it is you are thinking about. LISA N I C H O L S AUTHORAND PERSONAL EMPOWERMENT ADVOCATE The law of attraction is really obedient. When you think of the things that you want, and you focus on them with all of your intention, then the law of attraction will give you exactly 14 The Secret what you want, every time. When you focus on the things that you don't want — \\"I don't want to be late, I don't want to be late\\"—the law of attraction doesn't hear that you don't want it. It manifests the things that you're thinking of and so it's going to show up over and over and over again. The law of attraction is not biased to wants or don't wants. When you focus on something, no matter what it happens to be, you really are calling that into existence. When you focus your thoughts on something you want, and you hold that focus, you are in that moment summoning what you want with the mightiest power in the Universe. The law of attraction doesn't compute \\"don't\\" or \\"not\\" or \\"no,\\" or any other words of negation. As you speak words of negation, this is what the law of attraction is receiving: \\"I don't want to spill something on this outfit.\\" \\"I want to spill something on this outfit and I want to spill more things.\\" \\"I don't want a bad haircut.\\" \\"I want bad haircuts.\\" \\"I don't want to be delayed.\\" \\"I want delays.\\" \\"I don't want that person to be rude to me.\\" \\"I want that person and more people to be rude to me.\\" \\"I don't want the restaurant to give away our table.\\" \\"I want restaurants to give away our tables.\\" The Secret Revealed 15 \\"I don't want these shoes to hurt.\\" \\"I want shoes to hurt.\\" \\"I can't handle all this work.\\" \\"I want more work than I can handle.\\" \\"I don't want to catch the flu.\\" \\"I want the flu and I want to catch more things.\\" \\"I don't want to argue.\\" \\"I want more arguing.\\" \\"Don't speak to me like that.\\" \\" I want you to speak to me like that and I want other people to speak to me like that.\\" The law of attraction is giving you what you are thinking about —period! BOB PROCTOR The law of attraction is always working, whether you believe it or understand it or not. The law of attraction is the law of creation. Quantum physicists tell us that the entire Universe emerged from thought! You create your life through your thoughts and the law of attraction, and every single person does the same. It doesn't just work if you know about it. It has always been working in your life and every other person's life throughout history. When you become aware of this great law, then you become aware of how incredibly powerful you are, to be able to THINK your life into existence. 16 The Secret LISA NICHOLS It's working as much as you're thinking. Any time your thoughts are flowing, the law of attraction is working. When you're thinking about the past, the law of attraction's working. When you're thinking about the present or the future, the law of attraction is working. It's an ongoing process. You don't press pause, you don't press stop. It is forever in action, as your thoughts are. Whether we realize it or not, we are thinking most of the time. If you are speaking or listening to someone, you are thinking. If you are reading the newspaper or watching television, you are thinking. When you recall memories from your past, you are thinking. When you are considering something in your future, you are thinking. When you are driving, you are thinking. When you arc getting ready in the morning, you are thinking. For many of us, the only time we are not thinking is when we are asleep; however, the forces of attraction are still operating on our last thoughts as we fall asleep. Make your last thoughts before going to sleep good thoughts. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH Creation is always happening. Every time an individual has a thought, or a prolonged chronic way of thinking, they're in the creation process. Something is going to manifest out of those thoughts. What you are thinking now is creating your future life. You create your life with your thoughts. Because you are always thinking, you The Secret Revealed 17 are always creating. What you think about the most or focus on the most is what will appear as your life. Like all the laws of nature, there is utter perfection in this law. You create your life. Whatever you sow, you reap! Your thoughts are seeds, and the harvest you reap will depend on the seeds you plant. If you are complaining, the law of attraction will powerfully bring into your life more situations for you to complain about. If you are listening to someone else complain and focusing on that sympa-thizing with them, agreeing with them, in that moment, you are attracting more situations to yourself to complain about. The law is simply reflecting and giving back to you exactly what you are focusing on with your thoughts. With this powerful knowledge, you can completely change every circumstance and event in your entire life, by changing the way you think. BILL HARRIS TEACHER AND FOUNDER OF CENTERPOINTE RESEARCH INSTITUTE I had a student named Robert, who was taking an online course I have, part of which entails email access to me. Robert was gay. He outlined all of the grim realities of his life in his emails to me. In his job, his coworkers ganged up on him. It was constantly stressful because of how nasty 18 The Secret they were with him. When he walked down the street, he was accosted by homophobic people who wanted to abuse him in some way. He wanted to become a stand-up comedian, and when he did a stand-up comedy job, everybody heckled him about being gay. His whole life was one of unhappiness and misery, and it all focused around being attacked because he was gay. I began to teach him that he was focusing on what he did not want. I directed him back to his email that he sent me and said, \\"Read it again. Look at all the things you do not want that you're telling me about. I can tell you're very passionate about this and when you focus on something with a lot of passion, it makes it happen even faster!\\" Then he started taking this thing about focusing on what you want to heart, and he began really trying it. What happened within the next six to eight weeks was an absolute miracle. All the people in his office who had been harassing him either transferred to another department, quit working at the company, or started completely leaving him alone. He began to love his job. When he walked down the street, nobody harassed him anymore. They just weren't there. When he did his stand-up comedy routines he started getting standing ovations, and nobody was heckling him! His whole life changed because he changed from focusing on what he did not want, what he was afraid of, what he wanted to avoid, to focusing on what he did want. The Secret Revealed 19 Robert's life changed because he changed his thoughts. He emitted a different frequency out into the Universe. The Universe must deliver the pictures of the new frequency no matter how impossible the situation might seem. Robert's new thoughts became his new frequency, and the pictures of his entire life changed. Your life is in your hands. No matter where you are now, no matter what has happened in your life, you can begin to consciously choose your thoughts, and you can change your life. There is no such thing as a hopeless situation. Every single circumstance of your life can change! MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH You attract to you the predominant thoughts that you're holding in your awareness, whether those thoughts are conscious or unconscious. That's the rub. Whether you have been aware of your thoughts in the past or not, now you are becoming aware. Right now, with the knowledge of The Secret, you are waking up from a deep sleep and becoming aware! Aware of the knowledge, aware of the law, aware of the power you have through your thoughts. 20 The Secret DR JOHN DEMARTINI If you look very carefully when it comes to The Secret, and the power of our mind and the power of our intention in our daily lives, it's all around us. All we have to do is open our eyes and look. LISA NICHOLS You can see the law of attraction everywhere. You draw everything to yourself. The people, the job, the circumstances, the health, the wealth, the debt, the joy, the car that you drive, the community that you're in. And you've drawn them all to you, like a magnet. What you think about you bring about Your whole life is a manifestation of the thoughts that go on in your head. This is a Universe of inclusion, not exclusion. Nothing is excluded from the law of attraction. Your life is a mirror of the dominant thoughts you think. All living things on this planet operate through the law of attraction. The difference with humans is that they have a mind that can discern. They can use their free will to choose their thoughts. They have the power to intentionally think and create their entire life with their mind. DR. FRED ALAN WOLF QUANTUM PHYSICIST, LECTURER, AND AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR I'm not talking to you from the point of view of wishful thinking or imaginary craziness. I'm talking to you from a deeper, basic understanding. The Secret Revealed 21 Quantum physics really begins to point to this discovery. It says that you can't have a Universe without mind entering into it, and that the mind is actually shaping the very thing that is being perceived. If you think about the analogy of being the most powerful transmission tower in the Universe, you will see the perfect correlation with Dr. Wolf's words. Your mind thinks thoughts and the pictures are broadcast back as your life experience. You not only create your life with your thoughts, but your thoughts add powerfully to the creation of the world, If you thought that you were insignificant and had no power in this world, think again. Your mind is actually shaping the world around you. The amazing work and discoveries of the quantum physicists over the last eighty years has brought us to a greater understanding of the unfathomable power of the human mind to create. Their work parallels the words of the world's great minds, including Carnegie, Emerson, Shakespeare, Bacon, Krishnamurti, and Buddha. BOB PROCTOR If you don't understand the law that doesn't mean you should reject it. You may not understand electricity, and yet you enjoy the benefits of it. I don't know how it works. But I do knew this: You can cook a man's dinner with electricity, and you can also cook the man! 22 The Secret MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH Oftentimes when people begin to understand the Great Secret, they become frightened of all the negative thoughts that they have. They need to be aware that it has been scientifically proven that an affirmative thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought. That eliminates a degree of worry right there. It really does take many negative thoughts and persistent negative thinking to bring something negative into your life. However, if you persist in thinking negative thoughts over a period of time, they will appear in your life. If you worry about having negative thoughts, you will attract more worrying about your negative thoughts, and multiply them at the same time. Decide right now that you are going to think only good thoughts. At the same time, proclaim to the Universe that all your good thoughts are powerful, and that any negative thoughts are weak. LISA NICHOLS Thank God that there's a time delay, that all of your thoughts don't come true instantly. We'd be in trouble if they did. The element of time delay serves you. It allows you to reassess, to think about what you want, and to make a new choice. All of your power to create your life is available right now, because right now is when you are thinking. If you have had some thoughts that will not be beneficial when they manifest, then right now you can change your thinking. You can erase your previous thoughts by The Secret Revealed 23 replacing them with good thoughts. Time serves you because you can think new thoughts and emit a new frequency, now! DR. JOE VITALE You want to become aware of your thoughts and choose your thoughts carefully and you want to have fun with this, because you are the masterpiece of your own life. You are the Michelangelo of your own life. The David you are sculpting is you. One way to master your mind is to learn to quiet your mind. Without exception, every teacher in this book uses meditation as a daily practice. It wasn't until I discovered The Secret that I realized how powerful meditation can be. Meditation quiets your mind, helps you control your thoughts, and revitalizes your body. The great news is that you don't have to set aside hours to meditate. Just three to ten minutes a day to begin with, can be incredibly powerful for gaining control over your thoughts. To become aware of your thoughts, you can also set the intention, \\"I am the master of my thoughts.\\" Say it often, meditate on it, and as you hold to that intention, by the law of attraction you must become that. You are now receiving the knowledge that will enable you to create the most magnificent version of You. The possibility of that version of you already exists on the frequency of \\"the most magnificent version of You.\\" Decide what you want to be, do, and have, think the thoughts of it, emit the frequency, and your vision will become your life. • The Great Secret of Life is the law of attraction. • The law of attraction says like attracts like, so when you think a thought, you are also attracting like thoughts to you. • Thoughts are magnetic, and thoughts have a frequency. As you think thoughts, they are sent out into the Universe, and they magnetically attract all like things that are on the same frequency. Everything sent out returns to the source—you. • You are like a human transmission tower, transmitting a frequency with your thoughts. If you want to change anything in your life, change the frequency by changing your thoughts. • Your current thoughts are creating your future life. What you think about the most or focus on the most will appear as your life. • Your thoughts become things. 25 M I C H A E L BERNARD BECKWITH We live in a universe in which there are laws, just as there is a law of gravity. If you fail off a building it doesn't matter if you're a good person or a had person, you're going to hit the ground. The law of attraction is a law of nature. It is as impartial and impersonal as the law of gravity is. It is precise, and it is exact DR. JOE VlTALE Everything that surrounds you right now in your life, including the things you're complaining about, you've attracted. Now I know at first blush that's going to be something that you hate to hear. You're going to immediately say, \\"I didn't attract the car accident. I didn't attract this particular client who gives me a hard time. I didn't particularly attract the debt.\\" And I'm here to be 27 The Secret a little bit in your face and to say, yes you did attract it. This is one of the hardest concepts to get, but once you've accepted it, it's life transforming. Often when people first hear this part of the Secret they recall events in history where masses of lives were lost, and they find it incomprehensible that so many people could have attracted themselves to the event. By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event. It doesn't necessarily mean they thought of that exact event, but the frequency of their thoughts matched the frequency of the event. If people believe they can be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they have no control over outside circumstances, those thoughts of fear, separation, and powerlessness, if persistent, can attract them to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. You have a choice right now. Do you want to believe that it's just the luck of the draw and bad things can happen to you at any time? Do you want to believe that you can be in the wrong place at the wrong time? That you have no control over circumstances? Or do you want to believe and know that your life experience is in your hands and that only all good can come into your life because that is the way you think? You have a choice, and whatever you choose to think will become your life experience. Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts. The Secret Made Simple 29 BOB DOYLE Most of us attract by default. We just think that we don't have any control over it. Our thoughts and feelings are on autopilot, and so everything is brought to us by default. No one would ever deliberately attract anything unwanted. Without the knowledge of The Secret, it is easy to see how some unwanted things may have occurred in your life or other people's lives. It simply came from a lack of awareness of the great creative power of our thoughts. DR. JOE VlTALE Now if this is your first time to hear this, it may feel like, \\"Oh, I have to monitor my thoughts? This is going to be a lot of work.\\" It will seem like that at first, but that's where the fun begins. The fun is that there are many shortcuts to The Secret, and you get to choose the shortcuts that work best for you. Read on, and you'll see how. MARCI SHIMOFF AUTHOR, INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER, AND TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADER It's impossible to monitor every thought we have. Researchers tell us that we have about sixty thousand thoughts a day. Can you imagine how exhausted you'd 30 The Secret feel trying to control all sixty thousand of those thoughts? Fortunately there's an easier way, and it's our feelings. Our feelings let us know what we're thinking. The importance of feelings cannot be overstated. Your feelings are your greatest tool to help you create your life. Your thoughts are the primary cause of everything. Everything else you see and experience in this world is effect, and that includes your feelings. The cause is always your thoughts. BOB DOYLE / The emotions are an incredible gift that we have to let us know what we're thinking. Your feelings tell you very quickly what you're thinking. Think about when your feelings suddenly took a dive—maybe when you heard some bad news. That feeling in your stomach or solar plexus was instant. So your feelings are an immediate signal for you to know what you are thinking. You want to become aware of how you're feeling, and get in tune with how you're feeling, because it is the fastest way for you to know what you're thinking. LISA NICHOLS You have two sets of feelings: good feelings and bad feelings. And you know the difference between the two because one makes you feel good, and the other makes you feel bad. It's the depression, it's the anger, it's the resentment, it's the guilt. It's The Secret Made Simple 31 those feelings that don't make you feel empowered. Those are the bad feelings. No one can tell you whether you are feeling good or bad, because you are the only one who knows how you're feeling at any time. If you're not sure how you're feeling, just ask yourself, \\"How am I feeling?\\" You can stop and ask this question often during the day, and as you do you will become more aware of how you're feeling. The most important thing for you to know is that it is impossible to feel bad and at the same time be having good thoughts. That would defy the law, because your thoughts cause your feelings. If you are feeling bad, it is because you are thinking thoughts that are making you feel bad. Your thoughts determine your frequency, and your feelings tell you immediately what frequency you are on. When you are feeling bad, you are on the frequency of drawing more bad things. The law of attraction must respond by broadcasting back to you more pictures of bad things and things that will make you feel bad. As you feel bad, and don't make any effort to change your thoughts and feel better, you are in effect saying, \\"Bring me more circumstances that will make me feel bad. Bring it on!\\" LISA NICHOLS The flipside to that is that you have good emotions and good feelings. You know when they come because they make you feel good. Excitement, joy, gratitude, love. Imagine if we could 32 The Secret feel that way every day. When you celebrate the good feelings, you'll draw to you more good feelings, and things that make you feel good. BOB DOYLE It's really so simple. \\"What am I attracting right now? \\" Well, how do you feel? \\"I feel good.\\" Well good, keep doing that. It is impossible to feel good and at the same time be having negative thoughts. If you are feeling good, it is because you are thinking good thoughts. You see, you can have whatever you want in your life, no limits. But there's one catch: You have to feel good. And when you think about it, isn't that all you ever want? The law is indeed perfect. MARCLSHIMOFF If you're feeling good, then you're creating a future that's on track with your desires. If you're feeling bad, you're creating a future that's off track with your desires. As you go about your day, the law of attraction is working in every second. Everything we think and feel is creating our future. If you're worried or in fear, then you're bringing more of that into your life throughout the day. When you are feeling good, you must be thinking good thoughts. So you are on track and you are emitting a powerful frequency that is attracting back to you more good things that will make you feel good. Seize those moments when you are feeling good, and milk The Secret Made Simple 33 them. Be aware that as you are feeling good, you are powerfully attracting more good things to you. Let's go one step further. What if your feelings are actually communication from the Universe to let you know what you're thinking? JACKCANFIELD Our feelings are a feedback mechanism to us about whether we're on track or not, whether we're on course or off course. Remember that your thoughts are the primary cause of everything. So when you think a sustained thought it is immediately sent out into the Universe. That thought magnetically attaches itself to the like frequency and then within seconds sends the reading of that frequency back to you through your feelings. Put another way, your feelings are communication back to you from the Universe, telling you what frequency you are currently on. Your feelings are your frequency feedback mechanism! When you are feeling good feelings, it is communication back from the Universe saying, \\"You are thinking good thoughts\\" Likewise, when you are feeling bad, you are receiving communication back from the Universe saying, \\"You are thinking bad thoughts.\\" So when you are feeling bad it is communication from the Universe, and in effect it is saying, \\"Warning! Change thinking now. Negative frequency recording. Change frequency. Counting down to manifestation. Warning!\\" 34 The Secret The next time you are feeling bad or feeling any negative emotion, listen to the signal you are receiving from the Universe. In that moment you are blocking your own good from coming to you because you are on a negative frequency. Change your thoughts and think about something good, and when the good feelings start to come you will know it was because You shifted yourself on to a new frequency, and the Universe has confirmed it with better feelings. BOB DOYLE You 're getting exactly what you're feeling about, not so much what you're thinking about. That's why people tend to spiral if they stub their toe getting out of bed. Their whole day goes like that. They have no clue that a simple shifting of their emotions can change their entire day—and life. If you start out having a good day and you're in that particular happy feeling, as long as you don't allow something to change your mood, you're going to continue to attract, by the law of attraction, more situations and people that sustain that happy feeling. We all have experienced those days or times when one thing after another goes wrong. The chain reaction began with one thought, whether you were aware of it or not. The one bad thought attracted more bad thoughts, the frequency locked in, and eventually something went wrong. Then as you reacted to that one thing going The Secret Made Simple 35 wrong, you attracted more things going wrong. Reactions just attract more of the same, and the chain reaction must keep occurring until you move yourself off that frequency by intentionally changing your thoughts. You can shift your thoughts to what you want receive confirma-tion through your feelings that you changed your frequency, and the law of attraction will grab hold of that new frequency and send it back to you as the new pictures of your life. Now here is where you can harness your feelings and use them to turbo-charge what you want in your life. You can purposefully use your feelings to transmit an even more powerful frequency, by adding feeling to what you are wanting. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH You can begin right now to feel healthy. You can begin to feel prosperous. You can begin to feet the love that's surrounding you, even if it's not there. And what will happen is the universe will correspond to the nature of your song. The universe will correspond to the nature of that inner feeling and manifest, because that's the way you feel. So what are you feeling now? Take a few moments to think about how you feel. If you're not feeling as good as you'd like to, focus on feeling your feelings inside and purposefully lift them. As you focus intensely on your feelings, with the intention to lift yourself, you can powerfully elevate them. One way is to close your eyes 36 The Secret (shutting out distractions), focus on your feelings inside, and smile for one minute. LISA N I C H O L S Your thoughts and your feelings create your life. It will always be that way. Guaranteed! Just like the law of gravity, the law of attraction never slips up. You don't see pigs flying because the law of gravity made a mis-take and forgot to apply gravity to pigs that day. Likewise, there are no exclusions to the law of attraction. If something came to you, you drew it, with prolonged thought. The law of attraction is precise. M I C H A E L B E R N A R D BECKWITH It's hard to swallow, but when we can begin to open ourselves up to that, the ramifications are awesome. It means that whatever thought has done in your life, it can be undone through a shift in your awareness. You have the power to change anything, because you are the one who chooses your thoughts and you are the one who feels your feelings. 'You create your own universe as you go along.\\" The Secret Made Simple D R . JOE VITALE It's really important that you feel good, because this feeling good is what goes out as a signal into the Universe and starts to attract more of itself to you. So the more you can feel good, the more you will attract the things that help you feel good, and are able to keep bringing you up higher and higher. BOB PROCTOR When you're feeling down, did you know that you can change it in an instant? Put on a beautiful piece of music, or start singing—that'll change your emotion. Or think of something beautiful. Think of a baby or somebody that you truly love, and dwell on it. Really keep that thought in your mind. Block every thing out but that thought. I guarantee you'll start to feel good. Make a list of some Secret Shifters to have up your sleeve. By Secret Shifters, I mean things that can change your feelings in a snap. It might be beautiful memories, future events, funny moments, nature, a person you love, your favorite music. Then if you find yourself angry or frustrated or not feeling good, turn to your Secret Shifters list and focus on one of them. Different things will shift you at different times, so if one doesn't work, go to another. It only takes a minute or two of changing focus to shift yourself and shift your frequency.","output":"From the given text, I learned several key concepts related to the Law of Attraction and personal transformation. Here are the main takeaways and ways to implement them: 1. **Law of Attraction**: This is the idea that like attracts like, meaning that the thoughts and energy we emit attract similar outcomes. Positive thoughts attract positive outcomes, and negative thoughts attract negative outcomes. **Implementation**: To harness the power of the Law of Attraction, consciously focus on positive thoughts and outcomes. Practice gratitude and visualize success to align your energy with what you desire. 2. **Thoughts and Feelings as a Magnet**: Thoughts are seen as a force or a magnetic signal that attracts matching experiences. **Implementation**: Pay close attention to your thoughts and feelings as they are indicators of what you're likely to attract. Replace negative thoughts with positive ones to shift your magnetism toward desirable experiences. 3. **Feelings as Indicators**: Feelings serve as a guide to understand what we are thinking and, consequently, what we are attracting. **Implementation**: Regularly check in with your feelings. If you're feeling negative emotions, it's a signal to change your thoughts. Use positive affirmations, meditate, or engage in activities that uplift your mood. 4. **Frequency of Thoughts**: The frequency or consistency of your thoughts plays a significant role in manifestation. **Implementation**: Cultivate consistent positive thinking through daily practices like affirmations, journaling, and visualization. 5. **Power of the Mind**: The mind has a powerful influence on personal reality and how the universe shapes our experiences. **Implementation**: Engage in mental exercises to strengthen your belief in your ability to shape your reality. Practice mindfulness and meditation to sharpen your mental focus. 6. **Elimination of Negativity**: It's important to focus on positive outcomes and not dwell on negative scenarios. **Implementation**: Develop a strategy to shift your focus away from negative thoughts, such as having a list of \\"Secret Shifters\\" like happy memories or inspiring music to change your mood. 7. **Time Delay**: This concept suggests that there is a delay between thoughts and their manifestation, providing an opportunity to reassess and redirect our focus. **Implementation**: Use the time delay to your advantage by realigning your thoughts toward positive outcomes whenever you catch yourself thinking negatively. 8. **Taking Control**: We have control over our thoughts and feelings, and we can use that control to shape our experiences. **Implementation**: Remind yourself that you have the power to choose your thoughts. Use intention-setting and regular reflection to control and direct your internal narrative. 9. **Consistent Awareness**: It's essential to maintain awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they continuously shape our reality. **Implementation**: Implement practices that promote self-awareness like journaling, reflective meditation, or mindfulness techniques. 10. **Transforming One’s Life**: By understanding and implementing the Law of Attraction, we can fundamentally transform our lives. **Implementation**: Commit to a lifelong practice of monitoring and adjusting your thoughts and emotions to align with the life you want to create. By understanding these principles and actively working to implement them in daily life, a person can begin to attract more positive experiences, relationships, and outcomes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Then if you find yourself angry or frustrated or not feeling good, turn to your Secret Shifters list and focus on one of them. Different things will shift you at different times, so if one doesn't work, go to another. It only takes a minute or two of changing focus to shift yourself and shift your frequency. 38 The Secret JAMES RAY PHILOSOPHER, LECTURER, AUTHOR, AND CREATOR OF PROSPERITY AND HUMAN POTENTIAL PROGRAMS The principle of feeling good applies to your family pets, for instance. Animals are wonderful, because they put you in a great emotional state. When you feel love for your pet, that great state of love will bring goodness into your life. And what a gift that is. \\"It is the combination of thought and love which forms the irresistible force of the law of attraction.\\" There is no greater power in the Universe than the power of love. The feeling of love is the highest frequency you can emit. If you could wrap every thought in love, if you could love everything and everyone, your life would be transformed. In fact, some of the great thinkers of the past referred to the law of attraction as the law of love. And if you think about it, you will understand why. If you think unkind thoughts about someone else, The Secret Made Simple 39 you will experience those unkind thoughts manifested. You cannot harm another with your thoughts, you only harm You. If you think thoughts of love, guess who receives the benefits—you! So if your predominant state is love, the law of attraction or the law of love responds with the mightiest force because you are on the highest frequency possible. The greater the love you feel and emit, the greater the power you are harnessing. \\"The principle which gives the thought the dynamic power to correlate with its object, and therefore to master every adverse human experience, is the law of attraction, which is another name for love. This is an eternal and fundamental principle inherent in all things, in every system of philosophy, in every Religion and in every Science. There is no getting away from the law of love. It is feeling that imparts vitality to thought. Feeling is desire and desire is love. Thought impregnated with love becomes invincible.\\" MARCI SHIMOFF Once you begin to understand and truly master your thoughts and feelings, that's when you see how you create your own reality. That's where your freedom is, that's where all your power is. 40 The Secret Marci Shimoff shared a wonderful quote from the great Albert Einstein: \\"The most important question any human being can ask themselves is, 'Is this a friendly Universe?'\\" Knowing the law of attraction, the only answer to give is, \\"Yes, the Universe is friendly.\\" Why? Because when you answer in this way, by the law of attraction you must experience that. Albert Einstein posed this powerful question because he knew The Secret. He knew by asking the question it would force us to think and make a choice. He gave us a great opportunity, just by posing the question. To take Einstein's intention even further, you can affirm and proclaim, \\"This is a magnificent Universe. The Universe is bringing all good things to me. The Universe is conspiring for me in all things. The Universe is supporting me in everything I do. The Universe meets all my needs immediately.\\" Know that this is a friendly Universe! J ACKCANFlELD Since I learned The Secret and started applying it to my life, my life has truly become magical. I think the kind of life that everybody dreams of is one I live on a day-to-day basis. I live in a four-and-a-half-million-dollar mansion. I have a wife to die for. I get to vacation in all the fabulous spots of the world. I've climbed mountains. I've explored. I've been on safaris. And all of this happened, and continues to happen, because of knowing how to apply The Secret. The Secret Made Simple 41 BOB PROCTOR Life can be absolutely phenomenal, and it should be, and it will be, when you start using The Secret. This is your life, and it's been waiting for you to discover it! Up until now you may have been thinking that life is hard and a struggle, and so by the law of attraction you will have experienced life as hard and a struggle. Begin right now to shout to the universe, \\"Life is so easy! Life is so good! All good things come to me!\\" There is a truth deep down inside of you that has been waiting for you to discover it, and that Truth is this: you deserve all good things life has to offer. You know that inherently, because you feel awful when you are experiencing the lack of good things. All good things are your birthright! You are the creator of you, and the law of attraction is your magnificent tool to create whatever you want in your life. Welcome to the magic of life, and the magnificence of You! The law of attraction is a law of nature. It is as impartial as the law of gravity. Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts. To know what you're thinking, ask yourself how you are feeling. Emotions are valuable tools that instantly tell us what we are thinking. It is impossible to feel bad and at the same time have good thoughts. Your thoughts determine your frequency, and your feelings tell you immediately what frequency you are on. When you feel bad, you are on the frequency of drawing more bad things. When you feel good, you are powerfully attracting more good things to you. Secret Shifters, such as pleasant memories, nature, or your favorite music, can change your feelings and shift your frequency in an instant. The feeling of love is the highest frequency you can emit. The greater the love you feel and emit, the greater the power you are harnessing. 43 You are a creator, and there is an easy process to create using the law of attraction. The greatest teachers and avatars have shared the Creative Process through their wondrous work, in a myriad of forms. Some great teachers created stories to demonstrate how the Universe works. The wisdom contained in their stories has been handed down through the centuries and has become legendary. Many people living today do not realize that the essence of these stories is the very truth of life. JAMES RAY If you think about Aladdin and his lamp, Aladdin picks up the lamp, dusts it off, and out pops the Genie. The Genie always says one thing: \\"Your wish is my command!\\" The story now goes that there are three wishes, hut if you 45 46 The Secret trace the story back to its origins there's absolutely no limit whatsoever to the wishes. Think about that one. Now, let's take this metaphor and apply it to your life. Remember Aladdin is the one who always asks for what he wants. Then you've got the Universe at large, which is the Genie. Traditions have called it so many things—your holy guardian angel, your higher self. We can put any label on it, and you choose the one that works best for you, but every tradition has told us there's something bigger than us. And the Genie always says one thing: \\"Your wish is my command!\\" This wonderful story demonstrates how your whole life and everything in it has been created by You. The Genie has simply answered your every command. The Genie is the law of attraction, and it is always present and always listening to everything you think, speak, and act. The Genie assumes that everything you think about, you want! That everything you speak about, you want! That everything you act upon is what you want! You are the Master of the Universe, and the Genie is there to serve you. The Genie never questions your commands. You think it, and the Genie immediately begins to leverage the Universe, through people, circumstances, and events, to fulfill your wish. How to Use the Secret 47 The Creative Process used in The Secret, which was taken from the New Testament in the Bible, is an easy guideline for you to create what you want in three simple steps. LISA NICHOLS The first step is to ask. Make a command to the Universe. Let the Universe know what you want. The Universe responds to your thoughts. BOB P R O C T O R What do you really want? Sit down and write it out on a piece of paper. Write it in the present tense. You might begin by writing, \\"I am so happy and grateful now that...\\" And then explain how you want your life to be, in every area. You get to choose what you want, but you must get clear about what you want. This is your work. If you're not clear, then the law of attraction cannot bring you what you want. You will be sending out a mixed frequency and you can only attract mixed results. For the first time in your life perhaps, work out what it is you really want. Now that you know you can have, be, or do anything, and there are no limits, what do you want? 48 The Secret Asking is the first step in the Creative Process, so make it a habit to ask. If you have to make a choice and you don't know which way to go, ask! You should never be stumped on anything in your life. Just ask! DR. JOE VlTALE This is really fun. It's like having the Universe as your catalogue. You flip through it and say, \\"I'd like to have this experience and I'd like to have that product and I'd like to have a person like that.\\" It is You placing your order with the Universe. It's really that easy. You do not have to ask over and over again. Just ask once. It is exactly like placing an order from a catalogue. You only ever order something once. You don't place an order and then doubt the order has been received and so place the order again, and then again, and then again. You order once. It is the same with the Creative Process. Step One is simply your step to get clear about what you want. As you get clear in your mind, you have asked. LISA NICHOLS Step two is believe. Believe that it's already yours. Have what I love to call unwavering faith. Believing in the unseen. How to Use the Secret 49 You must believe that you have received. You must know that what you want is yours the moment you ask. You must have complete and utter faith. If you had placed an order from a catalogue you would relax/ know you are going to receive what you ordered, and get on with your life. \\"See the things that you want as already yours. Know that they will come to you at need. Then let them come. Don't fret and worry about them. Don't think about your lack of them. Think of them as yours, as belonging to you, as already in your possession.\\" In the moment you ask, and believe and know you already have it in the unseen, the entire Universe shifts to bring it into the seen. You must act, speak, and think, as though you are receiving it now. Why? The Universe is a mirror, and the law of attraction is mirroring back to you your dominant thoughts. So doesn't it make sense that you have to see yourself as receiving it? If your thoughts contain noticing you do not have it yet, you will continue to attract not having it yet. You must believe you have it already. You must believe you have received it. You have to emit the feeling frequency of having received it, to bring those pictures back as your life. When you do that, the law of attraction will powerfully move all circumstances, people, and events, for you to receive. 50 The Secret When you book a vacation, order a brand new car, or buy a house, you know those things are yours. You wouldn't go and book another vacation for the same time, or purchase another car or house. If you won a lottery or received a large inheritance, even before you physically had the money, you know it is yours. That is the feeling of believing it is yours. That is the feeling of believing you have it already. That is the feeling of believing you have received. Claim the things you want by feeling and believing they are yours. When you do that, the law of attraction will powerfully move all circumstances, people, and events for you to receive. How do you get yourself to a point of believing? Start make-believing. Be like a child, and make-believe. Act as if you have it already. As you make-believe, you will begin to believe you have received. The Genie is responding to your predominant thoughts all the time, not just in the moment you ask. That's why after you've asked, you must continue to believe and know. Have faith. Your belief that you have it, that undying faith, is your greatest power. When you believe you are receiving, get ready, and watch the magic begin! \\"You can have what you want—if you know how to form the mold for it in your own thoughts. There is no dream that may not come true, if you but learn to use the Creative Force working through you. The methods that work for one will work for all. The key to power lies in using what you have . . . freely, fully . . . and thus How to Use the Secret 51 opening wide your channels for more Creative Force to flow through you/' DR. JOE VlTALE The Universe will start to rearrange itself to make it happen for you. JACKCANFIELD Most of us have never allowed ourselves to want what we truly want, because toe can't see how it's going to manifest. BOB PROCTOR If you do just a little research, it is going to become evident to you that anyone that ever accomplished anything, did not know how they were going to do it. They only knew they were going to do it. DR. JOE VlTALE You don't need to know how it's going to come about You don't need to know how the Universe will rearrange itself How it will happen, how the Universe will bring it to you, is not your concern or job. Allow the Universe to do it for you. When you are trying to work out how it will happen, you are emitting a frequency that contains a lack of faith—that you don't believe you have it already. You think you have to do it and you do not believe the Universe will do it for you. The how is not your part in the Creative Process. 52 The Secret BOB PROCTOR You don't know how, it will be shown to you. You will attract the way. LISA N I C H O L S Most of the time, when we don't see the things that we've requested, we get frustrated. We get disappointed. And we begin to become doubtful. The doubt brings about a feeling of disappointment. Take that doubt and shift it. Recognize that feeling and replace it with a feeling of unwavering faith. \\"I know that it's on its way.\\" LISA N I C H O L S Step three, and the final step in the process, is to receive. Begin to feel wonderful about it. Feel the way you Will feel once it arrives. Feel it now. M A R C I S H I M O F F And in this process it's important to feel good, to be happy, because when you're feeling good you're putting yourself in the frequency of what you want. M I C H A E L B E R N A R D BECKWITH This is a feeling Universe. If you just intellectually believe something, but you have no corresponding feeling underneath How to Use the Secret 53 that, you don't necessarily have enough power to manifest what you want in your life. You have to feel it. Ask once, believe you have received, and all you have to do to receive is feel good. When you are feeling good, you are on the frequency of receiving. You are on the frequency of all good things coming to you, and you will receive what you have asked for. You wouldn't ask for anything unless it was going to make you feel good in the receiving of it, would you? So get yourself on the feel-good frequency, and you will receive. A fast way to get yourself on that frequency is to say, \\"I am receiving now. I am receiving all the good in my life, now, I am receiving [fill in your desire] now.\\" And feel it. Feel it as though you have received. A dear friend of mine, Marcy, is one of the greatest manifestors I have seen, and she feels everything. She feels what it would feel like to have what she is asking for. She feels everything into existence. She doesn't get caught up in how, when, or where, she Just feels it and it then manifests. So feel good now. BOB PROCTOR When you turn that fantasy into a fact, you're in the position to build bigger and bigger fantasies. And that, my friend, is the Creative Process. 54 The Secret \\"Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\\"' \\"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\\" BOB DOYLE The law of attraction, the study and practice of the law of attraction, is just figuring out what will help you generate the feelings of having it now. Go test drive that car. Go shop for that home. Get in the house. Do whatever you have to do to generate the feelings of having it now, and remember them. Whatever you can do to achieve that will help you to literally attract it. When you feel as though you have it now, and the feeling is so real that it is like you have it already, you are believing that you have received/ and you will receive. BOB DOYLE It could be you wake up and it's just there. It's manifested. Or, you might get some inspired idea of some action to take. You certainly shouldn't be saying, \\"Well, I could do it this way, but man, I would hate that.\\" You 're not on the right track if that's the case. How to Use the Secret 55 Action will sometimes be required, but if you're really doing it in line with what the Universe is trying to bring to you, it's going to feel joyous. You're going to feel so alive. Time will just stop. You could do it all day. Action is a word that can imply \\"work\\" to some people, but inspired action will not feel like work at all. The difference between inspired action and action is this: Inspired action is when you are acting to receive. If you are in action to try and make it happen, you have slipped backward. Inspired action is effortless, and it feels wonderful because you are on the frequency of receiving. Imagine life as a fast-moving riven When you are acting to make something happen it will feel as if you are going against the current of the river. It will feel hard and like a struggle. When you are acting to receive from the Universe, you will feel as if you are flowing with the current of the river. It will feel effortless. That is the feeling of inspired action, and of being in the flow of the Universe and life. Sometimes you will not even be aware you used \\"action\\" until after you've received, because the acting felt so good. You will then look back and see the wonder and matrix of how the Universe carried you to what you wanted, and also brought what you wanted to you. DR. JOE VlTALE The Universe likes speed. Don't delay. Don't second guess. Don't doubt. When the opportunity is there, when the impulse 56 The Secret i s there, when the intuitive nudge from within is there, act. That's your job. And that's all you have to do. Trust your instincts. It's the Universe inspiring you. It's the Universe communicating with you on the receiving frequency. If you have an intuitive or instinctive feeling, follow it, and you will find that the Universe is magnetically moving you to receive what you asked for. BOB PROCTOR You will attract everything that you require. If it's money you need you will attract it. If it's people you need you'll attract it. If it's a certain book you need you'll attract it. You've got to pay attention to what you're attracted to, because as you hold images of what you want, you're going to be attracted to things and they're going to be attracted to you. But it literally moves into physical reality with and through you. And it does that by law. Remember that you are a magnet, attracting everything to you. When you have gotten clear in your mind about what you want you have become a magnet to draw those things to you, and those things you want are magnetized to you in return. The more you practice and begin to see the law of attraction bringing things to you, the greater the magnet you will become, because you will add the power of faith, belief, and knowing. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH You can start with nothing, and out of nothing and out of no way, a way will be made. How to Use the Secret 57 All you require is You, and your ability to think things into being. Everything that has been invented and created throughout the history of humankind began with one thought. From that one thought a way was made, and it manifested from the invisible into the visible. JACK CANFIELD Think of a car driving through the night The headlights only go a hundred to two hundred feet forward, and you can make it all the way from California to New York driving through the dark, because all you have to see is the next two hundred feet. And that's how life tends to unfold before us. If we just trust that the next two hundred feet will unfold after that, and the next two hundred feet will unfold after that, your life will keep unfolding. And it will eventually get you to the destination of whatever it is you truly want, because you want it. Trust the Universe. Trust and believe and have faith. I truly had no idea how I was going to bring the knowledge of The Secret onto the movie screen. I just held to the outcome of the vision, I saw the outcome clearly in my mind, I felt it with all my might, and everything that we needed to create The Secret came to us. \\"Take the first step in faith.

Step One is simply your step to get clear about what you want. As you get clear in your mind, you have asked. LISA NICHOLS Step two is believe. Believe that it's already yours. Have what I love to call unwavering faith. Believing in the unseen. How to Use the Secret 49 You must believe that you have received. You must know that what you want is yours the moment you ask. You must have complete and utter faith. If you had placed an order from a catalogue you would relax/ know you are going to receive what you ordered, and get on with your life. \\"See the things that you want as already yours. Know that they will come to you at need. Then let them come. Don't fret and worry about them. Don't think about your lack of them. Think of them as yours, as belonging to you, as already in your possession.\\" In the moment you ask, and believe and know you already have it in the unseen, the entire Universe shifts to bring it into the seen. You must act, speak, and think, as though you are receiving it now. Why? The Universe is a mirror, and the law of attraction is mirroring back to you your dominant thoughts. So doesn't it make sense that you have to see yourself as receiving it? If your thoughts contain noticing you do not have it yet, you will continue to attract not having it yet. You must believe you have it already. You must believe you have received it. You have to emit the feeling frequency of having received it, to bring those pictures back as your life. When you do that, the law of attraction will powerfully move all circumstances, people, and events, for you to receive. 50 The Secret When you book a vacation, order a brand new car, or buy a house, you know those things are yours. You wouldn't go and book another vacation for the same time, or purchase another car or house. If you won a lottery or received a large inheritance, even before you physically had the money, you know it is yours. That is the feeling of believing it is yours. That is the feeling of believing you have it already. That is the feeling of believing you have received. Claim the things you want by feeling and believing they are yours. When you do that, the law of attraction will powerfully move all circumstances, people, and events for you to receive. How do you get yourself to a point of believing? Start make-believing. Be like a child, and make-believe. Act as if you have it already. As you make-believe, you will begin to believe you have received. The Genie is responding to your predominant thoughts all the time, not just in the moment you ask. That's why after you've asked, you must continue to believe and know. Have faith. Your belief that you have it, that undying faith, is your greatest power. When you believe you are receiving, get ready, and watch the magic begin! \\"You can have what you want—if you know how to form the mold for it in your own thoughts. There is no dream that may not come true, if you but learn to use the Creative Force working through you. The methods that work for one will work for all. The key to power lies in using what you have . . . freely, fully . . . and thus How to Use the Secret 51 opening wide your channels for more Creative Force to flow through you/' DR. JOE VlTALE The Universe will start to rearrange itself to make it happen for you. JACKCANFIELD Most of us have never allowed ourselves to want what we truly want, because toe can't see how it's going to manifest. BOB PROCTOR If you do just a little research, it is going to become evident to you that anyone that ever accomplished anything, did not know how they were going to do it. They only knew they were going to do it. DR. JOE VlTALE You don't need to know how it's going to come about You don't need to know how the Universe will rearrange itself How it will happen, how the Universe will bring it to you, is not your concern or job. Allow the Universe to do it for you. When you are trying to work out how it will happen, you are emitting a frequency that contains a lack of faith—that you don't believe you have it already. You think you have to do it and you do not believe the Universe will do it for you. The how is not your part in the Creative Process. 52 The Secret BOB PROCTOR You don't know how, it will be shown to you. You will attract the way. LISA N I C H O L S Most of the time, when we don't see the things that we've requested, we get frustrated. We get disappointed. And we begin to become doubtful. The doubt brings about a feeling of disappointment. Take that doubt and shift it. Recognize that feeling and replace it with a feeling of unwavering faith. \\"I know that it's on its way.\\" LISA N I C H O L S Step three, and the final step in the process, is to receive. Begin to feel wonderful about it. Feel the way you Will feel once it arrives. Feel it now. M A R C I S H I M O F F And in this process it's important to feel good, to be happy, because when you're feeling good you're putting yourself in the frequency of what you want. M I C H A E L B E R N A R D BECKWITH This is a feeling Universe. If you just intellectually believe something, but you have no corresponding feeling underneath How to Use the Secret 53 that, you don't necessarily have enough power to manifest what you want in your life. You have to feel it. Ask once, believe you have received, and all you have to do to receive is feel good. When you are feeling good, you are on the frequency of receiving. You are on the frequency of all good things coming to you, and you will receive what you have asked for. You wouldn't ask for anything unless it was going to make you feel good in the receiving of it, would you? So get yourself on the feel-good frequency, and you will receive. A fast way to get yourself on that frequency is to say, \\"I am receiving now. I am receiving all the good in my life, now, I am receiving [fill in your desire] now.\\" And feel it. Feel it as though you have received. A dear friend of mine, Marcy, is one of the greatest manifestors I have seen, and she feels everything. She feels what it would feel like to have what she is asking for. She feels everything into existence. She doesn't get caught up in how, when, or where, she Just feels it and it then manifests. So feel good now. BOB PROCTOR When you turn that fantasy into a fact, you're in the position to build bigger and bigger fantasies. And that, my friend, is the Creative Process. 54 The Secret \\"Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\\"' \\"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\\" BOB DOYLE The law of attraction, the study and practice of the law of attraction, is just figuring out what will help you generate the feelings of having it now. Go test drive that car. Go shop for that home. Get in the house. Do whatever you have to do to generate the feelings of having it now, and remember them. Whatever you can do to achieve that will help you to literally attract it. When you feel as though you have it now, and the feeling is so real that it is like you have it already, you are believing that you have received/ and you will receive. BOB DOYLE It could be you wake up and it's just there. It's manifested. Or, you might get some inspired idea of some action to take. You certainly shouldn't be saying, \\"Well, I could do it this way, but man, I would hate that.\\" You 're not on the right track if that's the case. How to Use the Secret 55 Action will sometimes be required, but if you're really doing it in line with what the Universe is trying to bring to you, it's going to feel joyous. You're going to feel so alive. Time will just stop. You could do it all day. Action is a word that can imply \\"work\\" to some people, but inspired action will not feel like work at all. The difference between inspired action and action is this: Inspired action is when you are acting to receive. If you are in action to try and make it happen, you have slipped backward. Inspired action is effortless, and it feels wonderful because you are on the frequency of receiving. Imagine life as a fast-moving riven When you are acting to make something happen it will feel as if you are going against the current of the river. It will feel hard and like a struggle. When you are acting to receive from the Universe, you will feel as if you are flowing with the current of the river. It will feel effortless. That is the feeling of inspired action, and of being in the flow of the Universe and life. Sometimes you will not even be aware you used \\"action\\" until after you've received, because the acting felt so good. You will then look back and see the wonder and matrix of how the Universe carried you to what you wanted, and also brought what you wanted to you. DR. JOE VlTALE The Universe likes speed. Don't delay. Don't second guess. Don't doubt. When the opportunity is there, when the impulse 56 The Secret i s there, when the intuitive nudge from within is there, act. That's your job. And that's all you have to do. Trust your instincts. It's the Universe inspiring you. It's the Universe communicating with you on the receiving frequency. If you have an intuitive or instinctive feeling, follow it, and you will find that the Universe is magnetically moving you to receive what you asked for. BOB PROCTOR You will attract everything that you require. If it's money you need you will attract it. If it's people you need you'll attract it. If it's a certain book you need you'll attract it. You've got to pay attention to what you're attracted to, because as you hold images of what you want, you're going to be attracted to things and they're going to be attracted to you. But it literally moves into physical reality with and through you. And it does that by law. Remember that you are a magnet, attracting everything to you. When you have gotten clear in your mind about what you want you have become a magnet to draw those things to you, and those things you want are magnetized to you in return. The more you practice and begin to see the law of attraction bringing things to you, the greater the magnet you will become, because you will add the power of faith, belief, and knowing. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH You can start with nothing, and out of nothing and out of no way, a way will be made. How to Use the Secret 57 All you require is You, and your ability to think things into being. Everything that has been invented and created throughout the history of humankind began with one thought. From that one thought a way was made, and it manifested from the invisible into the visible. JACK CANFIELD Think of a car driving through the night The headlights only go a hundred to two hundred feet forward, and you can make it all the way from California to New York driving through the dark, because all you have to see is the next two hundred feet. And that's how life tends to unfold before us. If we just trust that the next two hundred feet will unfold after that, and the next two hundred feet will unfold after that, your life will keep unfolding. And it will eventually get you to the destination of whatever it is you truly want, because you want it. Trust the Universe. Trust and believe and have faith. I truly had no idea how I was going to bring the knowledge of The Secret onto the movie screen. I just held to the outcome of the vision, I saw the outcome clearly in my mind, I felt it with all my might, and everything that we needed to create The Secret came to us. \\"Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.\\"","output":"From the passages you provided, which are excerpts from \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne and insights from various contributors like Bob Proctor, James Ray, and others, we learn about the Law of Attraction, a principle suggesting that positive or negative thoughts bring positive or negative experiences into a person's life. Below are the key lessons and how to implement them: 1. **Change Your Emotion Instantly**: If you're feeling down, you can instantly change your emotions by focusing on something that makes you happy, like a piece of beautiful music or a loving memory. **Implementation**: Create a list of \\"Secret Shifters\\" such as your favorite song or a happy memory that you can think about when you're feeling negative to instantly boost your mood. 2. **The Power of Love**: Love is considered the highest frequency and the most powerful force. Wrapping your thoughts in love can transform your life. **Implementation**: Cultivate love in your thoughts and direct it towards yourself and others to harness the power of the law of attraction in a positive way. 3. **Thought-Frequency**: Your thoughts set your vibrational frequency. If you think positively, you attract positive experiences, and vice versa. **Implementation**: Monitor your emotional state to gauge your thoughts, and realign your thoughts towards positivity when you notice negative feelings. 4. **The Creative Process**: The process of turning your desires into reality consists of three steps: ask, believe, and receive. **Implementation**: - **Ask**: Clearly define and ask for what you want without worry about how it will come. - **Believe**: Truly believe that what you are asking for is already yours. - **Receive**: Feel and behave as if you have already received your desire. 5. **Inspired Action**: If action is required, it should be inspired and feel effortless, aligning with what the universe will bring you, rather than forced or stressful. **Implementation**: Take action when you feel intuitively inspired, acknowledging that it is part of the journey towards receiving what you wish for. 6. **Responsive Universe**: The Universe is described as a genie from the Aladdin metaphor, always responding \\"Your wish is my command\\" to your predominant thoughts. **Implementation**: Be mindful about what you wish for and keep your dominant thoughts aligned with your true desires. 7. **Visualization & Emotion**: To manifest desires, it's not enough to just think about them; you must also feel them as if they have already happened. **Implementation**: Engage in daily visualization exercises, envisioning your goals as already achieved and feeling the corresponding emotions. By actively applying these practices, one is believed to be able to manifest their desires into their reality, using the Law of Attraction as described in \\"The Secret.\\""},{"instruction":"more","output":"Certainly! Continuing with the themes presented in \\"The Secret\\" and the teachings of Bob Proctor and others, here are additional insights on how to implement the Law of Attraction principles in your life: 8. **Positive Expectation and Optimism**: Expect that the universe is friendly and that it conspires to help you achieve your desires. Maintain an optimistic outlook to attract positive outcomes. **Implementation**: Affirm daily that the universe is bringing good things your way and expect positive developments. This positive expectancy can actually attract favorable circumstances to you. 9. **Gratitude**: Feeling grateful in advance for what you want to receive is a powerful way to attract it into your life, because gratitude operates at a high vibrational frequency. **Implementation**: Keep a gratitude journal where you write down things you are grateful for every day, including the things you have asked for as if you have already received them. 10. **Letting Go of the \\"How\\"**: Release the need to know how your desires will manifest. Your job is to ask and believe; the universe will figure out the method. **Implementation**: Focus on the end result and trust that the universe will take care of the specifics. Avoid getting caught up in trying to control or predict the process by which your desires will come to pass. 11. **Visualization Techniques**: Use techniques like vision boards or creative visualization to reinforce your belief and keep your focus on your desires. **Implementation**: Create a vision board with pictures and words representing your goals, and spend time each day looking at it and feeling the emotions as if you've already achieved them. 12. **Act As-If**: Behave as if you are already the person you want to be or have the things you want to have. This aligns your energy with your desires. **Implementation**: Carry out your daily activities with confidence as if you have already achieved your desired state. Want to be more confident? Act confidently. Seeking a new job? Prepare your environment and routine as if you've got the job. 13. **Meditation and Mindfulness**: Practice meditation to clear your mind and align with your desires. Mindfulness helps you stay focused on your positive thoughts and feelings. **Implementation**: Spend time each day in silent meditation, focusing on your breath and the presence of abundance in your life. Stay mindful throughout the day to keep your thoughts in line with your desires. 14. **Persistence and Patience**: Understand that manifestation takes time, and not everything will appear instantly. Stay persistent in your practices and be patient. **Implementation**: Keep reaffirming your goals and maintain the emotional state of having received them, even when there's no physical evidence yet. Trust in the timing of the universe. 15. **Use Positive Affirmations**: Reinforce your intentions and belief with positive affirmations that support your goals. **Implementation**: Create affirmations that resonate with your desires and repeat them daily with conviction. Affirmations should be in present tense, positive, and reflect what you want to feel and experience. By incorporating these principles into your life consistently, you create a habitual pattern of thinking and feeling that aligns with your desires, making you a powerful magnet for manifestation. Remember, the key to effectively using the Law of Attraction is not only about asking for what you want but also truly believing it's on its way and readying yourself to receive it with open arms."},{"instruction":"Правомерно ли требование покупателя (юридическое лицо) об отказе от исполнения договора купли-продажи и возврата уплаченной за товар денежной суммы в случае обнаружения недостатка в течении 15 дней покупки автомобиля?","output":"Правомерность требования покупателя (юридического лица) об отказе от исполнения договора купли-продажи и возврата уплаченной за товар денежной суммы в случае обнаружения недостатка зависит от условий, предусмотренных в самом договоре, а также от действующего законодательства в данной юрисдикции.

As an accomplished mage, the crowd's expectation is high, and the Ethereal Aurora is a spell worthy of her status.

[Rolls a 20-sided die] **Dice Roll:** 14 Sapphire's initial roll would be a success for Ethereal Aurora, which requires a minimum of 13. However, because she is currently under the effects of Lily's regression spell, she regresses 1 year in age, to 15 years old. Given the regression spell's impact: **Adjusted Dice Roll:** 14 - 1 (penalty for age regression) = 13 Even with the penalty, Sapphire manages to weave the spell successfully, but it's just at the threshold, and not a perfect casting. The sky above the battlefield illuminates with a breathtaking aurora, bathing the arena in spectral hues. **Points Earned:** - Aurora summoned = 11 points The audience gasps in delight at the beautiful display, while Sapphire feels a slight dizziness as she senses her age slip by a year.

Sapphire now must think carefully about her next move, keeping in mind the continuous aging regression she faces with each spell."},{"instruction":"I try to cast Celestial Orbs","output":"With the challenge heightened by Lily's perfect execution, Sapphire remains composed. Conscious of the regression spell's effect and her reduced age, Sapphire locks her focus on casting the Celestial Orbs spell. She aims to awe the judges and the crowd with a spell that requires not only precision but a strong connection to the cosmos. Visualization is key; Sapphire extends her arms, picturing the celestial bodies within her mind and coalescing that vision into reality. Let's roll the die for Sapphire's attempt at Celestial Orbs: [Rolls a 20-sided die] **Dice Roll:** 11 However, due to her regression in age and the accompanying -1 penalty from the last spell, this roll is adjusted. **Adjusted Dice Roll:** 11 - 1 = 10 The Celestial Orbs spell has the following requirements: - Success range: 10-20 - Perfect casting range: 18-20 - Points for success: 9 - Points for perfect casting: 18 With the penalty factored in, Sapphire's adjusted dice roll meets the bare minimum for a successful casting of the spell.

The judges record Sapphire’s points, reflecting on her strong and consistent demonstration of skill despite the challenges she faces."},{"instruction":"do Lily's turn","output":"Lily watches Sapphire's celestial display with a calculating glint in her eyes. She understands that, while the regression spell she cast on her opponent is working, she cannot rely on underhanded tactics alone to maintain her standing as a competitor.

Let's roll the die for Sapphire's attempt at Runic Circle Aria. [Rolls a 20-sided die] **Dice Roll:** 17 Remembering the age regression penalty from the previous spells, we must adjust the roll. Sapphire has already cast two spells and regressed to 14, incurring a -2 penalty overall: **Adjusted Dice Roll:** 17 - 2 = 15 The Runic Circle Aria has the following requirements: - Success range: 12-20 - Perfect casting range: 19-20 - Points for success: 10 - Points for perfect casting: 21 Despite the penalty from Lily's regression spell, Sapphire's roll is successful for casting the Runic Circle Aria.

It's a close competition, with both mages demonstrating extraordinary skill and creativity with their spells. Sapphire is slightly ahead, but the regression spell's effects are adding another layer of strategy to consider. As the duel progresses, tension builds. Sapphire needs to continue showing exceptional talent while dealing with the increasing difficulty from her decreasing age. It's a delicate balance, where both strategy and spectacle will determine who emerges as the victor of this magical exhibition match."},{"instruction":"am I allowed to cast a specific spell more than once?","output":"In the rules of the duel as outlined at the beginning, you are not allowed to cast the same spell more than once. Each spell you cast must be different, preventing repetition and encouraging a diverse display of magical prowess. Since you have already used Ethereal Aurora, Celestial Orbs, and Runic Circle Aria, you'll need to select from your remaining spells for your next turn, each of which should demonstrate beauty, complexity, and artistry to impress the judges. Furthermore, remember that the regression spell cast by Lily is still affecting you, with each subsequent spell causing you to regress another year in age and adding an additional -1 penalty to your dice roll. Choosing which spell to cast next is crucial, taking into account both the difficulty of execution and the potential impact of the ongoing age regression."},{"instruction":"I try to cast Dragon’s Breath Symphony","output":"Determined to maintain her lead while displaying her broad repertoire of spellcraft, Sapphire sets her mind on casting the majestic Dragon’s Breath Symphony — a spell that not only demonstrates artistic brilliance but also her command over the elements, mimicking the fiery breath of a dragon in a dance of flames and music. With the audience watching intently and the flames of competition burning strong, Sapphire raises her arms to summon the fiery dragons, accommodating her gestures to her younger, 13-year-old form. Let's roll the dice to determine the success of Sapphire's casting of Dragon’s Breath Symphony. [Rolls a 20-sided die] **Dice Roll:** 10 Due to the -3 penalty from the regression caused by Lily's spell (as Sapphire has cast three spells so far), this roll is adjusted. **Adjusted Dice Roll:** 10 - 3 = 7 The Dragon’s Breath Symphony has the following casting parameters: - Success range: 9-19 - Perfect casting range: 17-19 - Points for success: 8 - Points for perfect casting: 16 The roll, even after the penalty, is unfortunately not quite enough to successfully conjure the spell. The complexity of the spell combined with the effects of the age regression spell perhaps offset Sapphire's focus, leading to a stutter in the symphony's magic. The dragons of flame waver and fade before fully taking shape, and the symphonic rhythm is interrupted, resulting in a less than satisfactory performance. As the incomplete spell dissipates, Sapphire feels the youth drain from her once more, now regressing to the age of 12, and she knows the next spell will carry an even higher penalty at -4. The judges take note of the failed attempt, offering empathetic looks towards the young champion who now faces an uphill struggle in this vivid display of magical dueling. It's a disheartening setback, but Sapphire’s overall performance has been excellent, and the duel is certainly not over yet. The score remains at 30 points for Sapphire.

This typically means that regardless of whether a previous attempt was successful or not, you may not repeat that spell. Given these guidelines, Sapphire would need to choose a different spell from her remaining repertoire for her next turn. Despite the failure of the previous attempt with the Dragon’s Breath Symphony, the rules encourage diversity and the display of varying magical abilities.

Unrolling the parchment, the head judge announces: \\"By a display of extraordinary talent and consistent performance, the winner of today's magical arts duel is... Lily, with a total of 64 points!\\" The crowd erupts into applause as Lily beams with pride, her earlier cheekiness replaced by a moment of genuine happiness and accomplishment. The head judge then turns to Sapphire. \\"And let us not forget the incredible artistry shown by Sapphire. Your spells were nothing short of breathtaking, and you've proven once more why you are champion of the teen division. Magic knows no age, and today, you have battled not just your opponent but the very bounds of time. We are all the richer for having witnessed your craft.\\" Sapphire may have faced an unexpected challenge with the regression spell, but her grace under pressure and her creative spellcasting left an indelible mark on all present. As the event concludes, and the competitors shake hands, there is a sense of mutual respect between the two mages. They have given the audience a duel to remember, a true celebration of the magical arts in all its splendor. And thus, the exhibition match comes to an end, with both competitors looking forward to their future journeys through the realms of magic."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: Dear customer, This is to notify you about the latest development concerning all the payments that are left in our custody, which yours are inclusive besides, where you are given a bill of Sum in order to receive your payment which we didn’t hear from you for sometime now.

The first thing to know is that if you focus on losing weight, you will attract back having to lose more weight so get \\"having to lose weight\\" out of your mind. It's the very reason why diets don't work. Because you are focused on losing weight, you must attract back continually having to lose weight. The second thing to know is that the condition of being overweight was created through your thought to it. To put it in the most basic terms, if someone is overweight, it came from thinking \\"fat thoughts/' whether that person was aware of it or not. A person cannot think \\"thin thoughts\\" and be fat. It completely defies the law of attraction. Whether people have been told they have a slow thyroid, a slow metabolism, or their body size is hereditary, these are all disguises for thinking \\"fat thoughts.\\" If you accept any of those conditions as applicable to you, and you believe it, it must become your experience, and you will continue to attract being overweight. After I had my two daughters I was overweight, and I know it came from listening to and reading the messages that it is hard to lose weight after having a baby, and even harder after the second baby. I summoned exactly that to me with those \\"fat thoughts,\\" How to Use the Secret 59 and it became my experience. I really \\"beefed up,\\" and the more I noticed how I had \\"beefed up,\\" the more \\"beefing up\\" I attracted. With a small frame, I became a hefty 143 pounds, all because I was thinking \\"fat thoughts.\\" The most common thought that people hold, and I held it too, is that food was responsible for my weight gain. That is a belief that does not serve you, and in my mind now it is complete balderdash! Food is not responsible for putting on weight. It is your thought that food is responsible for putting on weight that actually has food put on weight. Remember, thoughts are primary cause of everything, and the rest is effects from those thoughts. Think perfect thoughts and the result must be perfect weight. Let go of all those limiting thoughts. Food cannot cause you to put on weight unless you think it can. The definition of the perfect weight is the weight that feels good for you. No one else's opinion counts. It is the weight that feels good for you. You most likely know of someone who is thin and eats like a horse, and they proudly declare, \\"I can eat whatever I want and I am always the perfect weight.\\" And so the Genie of the Universe says, \\"Your wish is my command!\\" To attract your perfect weight and body using the Creative Process, follow these steps: 60 The Secret Get clear on the weight you want to be. Have a picture in your mind of what you will look like when you have become that perfect weight. Get pictures of yourself at your perfect weight, if you have them, and look at them often. If not, get pictures of the body you would like to have and look at those often. You must believe you will receive and that the perfect weight is yours already. You must imagine, pretend, act as if, make-believe, that the perfect weight is yours. You must see yourself as receiving that perfect weight. Write out your perfect weight and place it over the readout of your scale, or don't weigh yourself at all. Do not contradict what you have asked for with your thoughts, words, and actions. Don't buy clothes at your current weight. Have faith and focus on the clothes you are going to buy. Attracting the perfect weight is the same as placing an order with the catalogue of the Universe. You look through the catalogue, choose the perfect weight, place your order, and then it is delivered to you. Make it your intention to look for, admire, and inwardly praise people with your idea of perfect-weight bodies. Seek them out and How to Use the Secret 61 as you admire them and feel the feelings of that—you are summoning it to you. If you see people who are overweight, do not observe them, but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect body and feel it. You must feel good. You must feel good about You. This is important, because you cannot attract your perfect weight if you feel bad about your body now. If you feel bad about your body, that is a powerful feeling, and you will continue to attract feeling bad about your body. You will never change your body if you are critical of it and find fault with it, and in fact you will attract more weight to you. Praise and bless every square inch of your body. Think about all the perfect things about You. As you think perfect thoughts, as you feel good about You, you are on the frequency of your perfect weight, and you are summoning perfection. Wallace Wattles shares a wonderful tip about eating in one of his books. He recommends that when you eat, make sure you are entirely focused on the experience of chewing the food. Keep your mind present and experience the sensation of eating food, and do not allow your mind to drift to other things. Be present in your body and enjoy all the sensations of chewing the food in your mouth and swallowing it. Try it the next time you are eating. When you are completely present as you eat, the flavor of the food is so intense and magnificent; when you let your mind drift. 62 The Secret the flavor virtually disappears. I am convinced that if we can eat our food in the present, entirely focused on the pleasurable experience of eating, the food is assimilated into our bodies perfectly, and the result in our bodies must be perfection. The end of the story about my own weight is that I now maintain my perfect weight of 116 pounds and I can eat whatever I want. So, focus on your perfect weight! DR. JOE VlTALE Another thing people wonder about is, \\"How long will it take to manifest the car, the relationship, the money?\\" I don't have any rulebook that says it's going to take thirty minutes or three days or thirty days. It's more a matter of you being in alignment with the Universe itself. Time is just an illusion. Einstein told us that. If this is the first time you have heard it, you may find it a hard concept to get your head around, because you see everything happening—one thing after the other. What quantum physicists and Einstein tell us is that everything is happening simultaneously. If you can understand that there is no time, and accept that concept, then you will see that whatever you want in the future already exists. If everything is happening at the one time, then the parallel version of you with what you want already exists! How to Use the Secret 63 It takes no time for the Universe to manifest what you want. Any time delay you experience is due to your delay in getting to the place of believing, knowing, and feeling that you already have it. It is you getting yourself on the frequency of what you want When you are on that frequency, then what you want will appear. BOB DOYLE Size is nothing to the Universe. It is no more difficult to attract, on a scientific level, something that we consider huge to something that we consider infinitesimally small. The Universe does everything with zero effort. The grass doesn't strain to grow. It's effortless. It's just this great design. It's all about what's going on in your mind. It's about what we put in place, saying, ''This is big, it's going to take some time.\\" And, \\"This is small. I'll give it an hour.\\" Those are our rules that we define. There are no rules according to the Universe. You provide the feelings of having it now; it will respond—whatever it is. There is no time for the Universe and there is no size for the Universe. It is as easy to manifest one dollar as it is to manifest one million dollars. It is the same process, and the only reason why one may come faster and the other may take longer is because you thought that a million dollars was a lot of money and that one dollar was not very much. 64 The Secret BOB DOYLE Some people have an easier time with little things, and so we sometimes say start with something small, like a cup of coffee. Make it your intention to attract a cup of coffee today. BOB PROCTOR Hold an image of talking to an old friend that you haven't seen for a long time. Somehow or another somebody's going to start talking to you about that person. That person's going to phone you or you'll get a letter from her. Starting with something small is an easy way to experience the law of attraction with your own eyes. Let me share a story with you of a young man who did exactly that. He watched The Secret and he decided to start with something small. He created a picture of a feather in his mind/ and he made sure this feather was unique. He created particular markings on the feather so he would know without any doubt that if he saw this feather, it had come to him through his intentional use of the law of attraction. Two days later, he was about to walk into a high-rise building on a street in New York City. He said he did not know why, but he just happened to look down. There at his feet, at the entrance to a high-rise building in New York City, was the feather! Not just any feather, but the exact feather he had imagined. It was identical to the picture he had created in his mind, with all of its unique markings. In that moment he knew, without a shred of doubt, that this How to Use the Secret 65 was the law of attraction working in all its glory. He realized his amazing ability and power to attract something to himself through the power of his mind. With total faith, he has now moved onto creating much bigger things. DAVID SCHIRMER INVESTMENT TRAINER, TEACHER. AND WEALTH SPECIALIST People are amazed at how I line up parking spaces. I've done this right from when I first understood The Secret. I would visualize a parking space exactly where I wanted it, and 95 percent of the time it would be therefore me and I would just pull straight in. Five percent of the time I'd have to wait just a minute or two, and the person would pull out and I'd pull in, I do that all the time. Now you might understand why a person who says, \\"I always get parking spaces,\\" gets them. Or why a person who says, \\"I am really lucky, I win things all the time,\\" wins one thing after another, all the time. These people expect it. Begin to expect great things, and as you do, you will create your life in advance. 66 The Secret You can use the law of attraction to create your whole life in advance, right down to the next thing you are doing today Prentice Mulford, a teacher whose writings share so many insights into the law of attraction and how to use it, demonstrates how important it is to think your day in advance. \\"When you say to yourself 'I am going to have a pleasant visit or a pleasant journey/ you are literally sending elements and forces ahead of your body that will arrange things to make your visit or journey pleasant. When before the visit or the journey or the shopping trip you are in a bad humor, or fearful or apprehensive of something unpleasant, you are sending unseen agencies ahead of you which will make some kind of unpleasantness. Our thoughts, or in other words, our state of mind, is ever at work 'fixing up' things good or bad in advance.\\" Prentice Mulford wrote those words in the 1870s. What a pioneer! You can see clearly how important it is to think in advance every event in every day. You will no doubt have experienced the oppo-How to Use the Secret 67 site of thinking your day in advance, and one of the repercussions of that is having to rush and hurry. If you are rushing or hurrying, know that those thoughts and actions are based in fear (fear of being late) and you are \\"fixing up\\" bad things ahead for you. As you continue to rush, you will attract one bad thing after another into your path. In addition to that, the law of attraction is \\"fixing up\\" more future circumstances that will cause you to rush and hurry. You must stop and move yourself off that frequency. Take a few moments and shift yourself, if you don't want to summon bad things to you. Many people, particularly in Western societies, chase \\"time\\" and complain that they don't have enough time. Well, as someone says that they don't have enough time, so it must be by the law of attraction. If you have been chasing your tail with thoughts of not having enough time, from now on declare emphatically, \\"I have more than enough time,\\" and change your life. You can also turn waiting into a powerful time to create your future life. Next time you are in a situation where you are waiting, seize that time and imagine having all the things you want. You can do this anywhere, anytime. Turn every life situation into a positive one! Make it a daily habit to determine every event in your life in advance, through your thoughts. Set the Universal forces ahead of you in everything you do and everywhere you go, by thinking the way you want it to go in advance. Then you are creating your life intentionally. • Like Aladdin's Genie, the law of attraction grants our every command. • The Creative Process helps you create what you want in three simple steps: ask, believe, and receive. • Asking the Universe for what you want is your opportunity to get clear about what you want. As you get clear in your mind, you have asked. • Believing involves acting, speaking, and thinking as though you have already received what you've asked for. When you emit the frequency of having received it, the law of attraction moves people, events, and circumstances for you to receive. • Receiving involves feeling the way you will feel once your desire has manifested. Feeling good now puts you on the frequency of what you want. • To lose weight, don't focus on \\"losing weight.\\" Instead, focus on your perfect weight. Feel the feelings of your perfect weight, and you will summon it to you. • It takes no time for the Universe to manifest what you want. It is as easy to manifest one dollar as it is to manifest one million dollars. 68 • Starting with something small, like a cup of coffee or parking spaces, is an easy way to experience the law of attraction in action. Powerfully intend to attract something small As you experience the power you have to attract, you will move on to creating much bigger things. • Create your day in advance by thinking the way you want it to go, and you will create your life intentionally. DR. JOE VITALE A lot of people feel stuck or imprisoned or confined by their current circumstances. Whatever your circumstances right now, that is only your current reality, and current reality will begin to change as a result of beginning to use The Secret Your current reality or your current life is a result of the thoughts you have been thinking. All of that will totally change as you begin to change your thoughts and your feelings. \\"That a man can change himself... and master his own destiny is the conclusion of every mind who is wide-awake to the power of right thought.\\" (1866-1954) 71 72 The Secret LISA NICHOLS When you want to change your circumstances, you must first change your thinking. Every time you look inside your mail expecting to see a bill, guess what — it'll be there. Each day you go out dreading the bill! You're never expecting anything great. You're thinking debt, you're expecting debt. So debt must show up so you won't think you're crazy. And every day you confirm your thought: Is debt going to be there? Yes, debt's there. Is debt going to be there? Yes, debt's there. Is debt going to be there? Yes, debt's there. Wiry? Because you expected debt to be there. So it showed up, because the law of attraction is always being obedient to your thoughts. Do yourself a favor— expect a check! Expectation is a powerful attractive force, because it draws things to you. As Bob Proctor says, \\"Desire connects you with the thing desired and expectation draws it into your life.\\" Expect the things you want and don't expect the things you don't want. What do you expect now? JAMES RAY Most people look at their current state of affairs and they say, \\"This is who I am.\\" That's not who you are. That's who you were. Let's say for instance that you don't have enough money in your bank account, or you don't have the relationship that you want, or your health and fitness aren't up to par. That's not who you are; that's the residual outcome of your past thoughts and actions. So Powerful Processes 73 we're constantly living in this residual, if you will, of the thoughts and actions we've taken in the past. When you look at your current state of affairs and define yourself by that, then you doom yourself to have nothing more than the same in future. '\\"All that we are is a result of what we have thought.\\" I would like to share a process with you that came from the great teacher Neville Goddard in a lecture he delivered in 1954, entitled \\"The Pruning Shears of Revision.\\" This process has had a profound effect on my life. Neville recommends at the end of every day, before you go to sleep, to think through the events of the day. If any events or moments did not go the way you wanted, replay them in your mind in a way that thrills you. As you re-create those events in your mind exactly as you want, you are cleaning up your frequency from the day and you are emitting a new signal and frequency for tomorrow. You have intentionally created new pictures for your future. It is never too late to change the pictures. 74 The Secret DR. JOE VITALE What can you do right now to begin to turn your life around? The very first thing is to start making a list of things to be grateful for. This shifts your energy and starts to shift your thinking. Whereas before this exercise you might be focusing on what you don't have, your complaints, and your problems, you go in a different direction when you do this exercise. You start to be grateful for all the things that you feel good about. \\"If it is a new thought to you that gratitude brings your whole mind into closer harmony with the creative energies of the Universe, consider it well, and you will see that it is true.' MARCI SHIMOFF Gratitude is absolutely the way to bring more into your life. Powerful Processes 75 DR- JOHN GRAY PSYCHOLOGIST, AUTHOR, AND INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER Every man knows that when his wife is appreciating him for the little things that he does, what does he want to do? He wants to do more. It's always about appreciation. It pulls things in. It attracts support. DR. JOHN DEMARTINI Whatever we think about and thank about we bring about. JAMES RAY Gratitude has been such a powerful exercise for me. Every morning I get up and say \\"Thank you.\\" Every morning, when my feet hit the floor, \\"Thank you.\\" And then I start running through what I'm grateful for, as I'm brushing my teeth and doing the things I do in the morning. And I'm not just thinking about them and doing some rote routine. I'm putting it out there and I'm feeling the feelings of gratitude. The day we filmed James Ray sharing his powerful exercise of gratitude is one I will never forget. From that day on, I made James's process my life. Every morning, I do not get out bed until I have felt the feelings of gratitude for this brand new day and all I am grateful for in my life. Then as I get out of bed, when one foot touches the ground I say, \\"Thank,\\" and \\"you\\" as my second foot touches the ground. With each step I take on my way to the bath-76 The Secret room, I say \\"Thank you.\\" I continue to say and feel \\"Thank you\\" as I am showering and getting ready. By the time I am ready for the day, I have said \\"Thank you\\" hundreds of times. As I do this, I am powerfully creating my day and all that it will contain. I am setting my frequency for the day and intentionally declaring the way I want my day to go, rather than stumbling out of bed and letting the day take control of me. There is no more powerful way to begin your day than this. You are the creator of your life, and so begin by intentionally creating your day! Gratitude was a fundamental part of the teachings of all the great avatars throughout history. In the book that changed my life, The Science of Getting Rich, written by Wallace Wattles in 1910, gratitude is its longest chapter. Every teacher featured in The Secret uses gratitude as part of his or her day. Most of them begin their day with thoughts and feelings of gratitude. Joe Sugarman, a wonderful man and successful entrepreneur, watched the film The Secret and contacted me. He told me his favorite part was the gratitude process, and that his use of gratitude had contributed to all he had achieved in his life. With all the success Joe has attracted to himself, he continues to use gratitude every day, even for the smallest things. When he gets a parking space he always says and feels, \\"Thank you.\\" Joe knows the power of gratitude and all it has brought to him, and so gratitude is his way of life. With all that I have read and with all that I have experienced in my own life using The Secret, the power of gratitude stands above eve- Powerful Processes 77 rything else. If you only do one thing with the knowledge of The Secret use gratitude until it becomes your way of life. DR. JOE VITALE As soon as you start to feel different about what you already have, you will start to attract more of the good things. More of the things you can he grateful for. You could look around and say, \\"Well, I don't have the car I want. I don't have the house I want. I don't have the spouse I want. I don't have the health I want\\" Whoah! Back up, back up! Those are all the things you don't want. Focus on what you already have that you're grateful for. And it might be that you have the eyes to read this. It might be the clothes that you have. Yes, you might prefer something else and you might get something else pretty soon, if you start feeling grateful for what you have. \\"Many people who order their lives rightly in all other ways are kept in poverty by their lack of gratitude.\\" It is impossible to bring more into your life if you are feeling ungrateful about what you have. Why? Because the thoughts and feelings you emit as you feel ungrateful are all negative emotions. Whether it is jealousy, resentment, dissatisfaction, or feelings of \\"not enough\\" those feelings cannot bring you what you want. 78 The Secret They can only return to you more of what you do not want. Those negative emotions are blocking your own good coming to you. If you want a new car but you are not grateful for the car you have, that will be the dominant frequency you are sending out. Be grateful for what you have now. As you begin to think about all the things in your life you are grateful for, you will be amazed at the never-ending thoughts that come back to you of more things to be grateful for. You have to make a start, and then the law of attraction will receive those grateful thoughts and give you more just like them. You will have locked into the frequency of gratitude and all good things will be yours. \\"The daily practice of gratitude is one of the conduits by which your wealth will come to you.\\" LEE BROWER WEALTH TRAINER A N D SPECIALIST, AUTHOR. AN D TEACH ER I think everybody goes through times when they say, \\"Things aren 't working right,\\" or, \\"Things are going had.\\" Once, when there were some things going on in my family, I found a rock, and I just sat holding it. I took this rock, I stuck it in my pocket, and I said, \\"Every time I touch this rock I'm going to think of something Powerful Processes 79 that I'm grateful for.\\" So every morning when I get up in the morning, I pick it up off the dresser, I put it in my pocket, and I go through the things that I'm grateful for. At night, what do I do? I empty my pocket, and there it is again. I've had some amazing experiences with this idea. A guy from South Africa saw me drop it. He asked, \\"What is that?\\" I explained it to him, and he started calling it a gratitude rock. Two weeks later I got an email from him, in South Africa. And he said, \\"My son is dying from a rare disease. It's a type of hepatitis. Would you send me three gratitude rocks?\\" They were just ordinary rocks I found off the street, so I said, \\"Sure.\\" I had to make sure that the rocks were very special, so I went out to the stream, picked out the right rocks, and sent them off to him. Four or five months later I get an email from him. He said, \\"My son's better, he's doing terrific.\\" And he said, \\"But you need to know something. We've sold over a thousand rocks at ten dollars apiece as gratitude rocks, and we've raised all this money for charity. Thank you very much.\\" So it's very important to have an \\"attitude of gratitude.\\" The great scientist Albert Einstein revolutionized the way we view time, space, and gravity. From his poor background and poor beginnings, you would have thought it impossible for him to achieve all that he did. Einstein knew a great deal of The Secret, and he said, \\"Thank you\\" hundreds of times each day. He thanked all 80 The Secret the great scientists who had preceded him for their contributions, which had enabled him to learn and achieve even more in his work, and eventually become one of the greatest scientists who has ever lived. One of the most powerful uses of gratitude can be incorporated in the Creative Process to turbo-charge what you want. As Bob Proctor advised in the first step of the Creative Process, Ask, start by writing down what you want. \\"Begin each sentence with, I am so happy and grateful now that...\\" (and you fill in the rest). When you give thanks as though you have already received what you want, you are emitting a powerful signal to the Universe. That signal is saying that you have it already because you are feeling gratitude for it now. Each morning before you get out of bed, make it a habit to feel the feelings of gratitude in advance for the great day ahead, as though it is done. From the moment I discovered The Secret and formulated the vision to share this knowledge with the world, I gave thanks every day for the film The Secret, which would bring joy to the world. I had no idea how we would bring this knowledge to the screen, but trusted that we would attract the way. I stayed focused and held to the outcome. I felt deep feelings of gratitude in advance. As that became my state of being, the floodgates opened and all the magic flowed into our lives. For the magnificent team of The Secret, and for me, our deep, heartfelt feelings of gratitude continue to this day. We have become a team that resonates gratitude with every moment, and it has become our way of life. Powerful Processes 81 Visualization is a process that has been taught by all the great teachers and avatars throughout the centuries, as well as by all the great teachers living today. In Charles Haanel's book, The Master Key System, written in 1912, he gives twenty-four weekly exercises to master visualization. (More important, his complete Master Key System will also help you become the master of your thoughts.) The reason visualization is so powerful is because as you create pictures in your mind of seeing yourself with what it is you want, you are generating thoughts and feelings of having it now. Visualization is simply powerfully focused thought in pictures, and it causes equally powerful feelings. When you are visualizing, you are emitting that powerful frequency out into the Universe. The law of attraction will take hold of that powerful signal and return those pictures back to you, just as you saw them in your mind. DR. D E N I S WAITLEY I took the visualization process from the Apollo program, and instituted it during the 1980s and '90s into the Olympic program. It was called Visual Motor Rehearsal. When you visualize then you materialize. Here's an interesting thing about the mind: we took Olympic athletes 82 The Secret and had them run their event only in their mind, and then hooked them up to sophisticated biofeedback equipment. Incredibly, the same muscles fired in the same sequence when they were running the race in their mind as when they were running it on the track. How could this be? Because the mind can't distinguish whether you're really doing it or whether it's just a practice. If you've been there in the mind you'll go there in the body. Think about the inventors and their inventions: The Wright Brothers and the plane. George Eastman and film. Thomas Edison and the light bulb. Alexander Graham Bell and the tele-phone. The only way anything has ever been invented or created is because one person saw a picture in his mind. He saw it clearly, and by holding that picture of the end result in his mind, all the forces of the Universe brought his invention into the world, through him. These men knew The Secret. These were men who had utter faith in the invisible, and who knew the power within them to leverage the Universe and bring the invention into the visible. Their faith and their imagination have been the cause of the evolution of humankind, and we reap the benefits of their creative minds every single day. You may be thinking, \\"I do not have a mind like these great inventors.\\" You may be thinking, \\"They could imagine those things, but I can't.\\" You could not be further from the truth, and as you continue on this great discovery of the knowledge of The Secret, Powerful Processes 83 you will learn that you not only have the mind they had, but much more. MIKE DOOLEY When you 're visualizing, token you 've got that picture playing out in your mind, always and only dwell upon the end result. Here's an example. Look at the back of your hands, right now. Really look at the back of your hands: the color of your skin, the freckles, the blood vessels, the rings, the fingernails. Take in all those details. Right before you close your eyes, see those hands, your fingers, wrapping around the steering wheel of your brand new car. DR. JOE VITALE This is such a holographic experience—so real in this moment—that you don't even feel as if you need the car, because it feels like you have it already. Dr. Vitale's words brilliantly sum up the place you want to get yourself to when visualizing. When it feels like a jolt as you open your eyes in the physical world, your visualization became real. But that state, that plane, is the real. It is the field where everything is created, and the physical is just the result of the real held of all creation. That's why you won't feel as if you need it anymore, because you tuned in and felt the real field of creation through your visualization. In that field, you have everything now. When you feel that, you will know it. 84 The Secret JACK CAN FIELD It's the feeling that really creates the attraction, not just the picture or the thought. A lot of people think, \\"If I think positive thoughts, or if I visualize having what I want, that will be enough.\\" But if you're doing that and still not feeling abundant, or feeling loving or joyful, then it doesn't create the power of the attraction. BOB DOYLE You put yourself in the feeling place of really being in that car. Not \\"I wish I could get that car,\\" or, \\"Some day I'll have that car,\\" because that's a very definite feeling associated with that. It's not in the now. It's in the future. If you stay in that feeling, it will always be in the future. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH . Now that feeling and that inner seeing will begin to be an open doorway through which the power of the Universe will begin to express. \\"What this power is I cannot say. All know is that it exists.\\" JACK CANFIELD Our job is not to figure out the how. The how will show up out of a commitment and belief in the what. Powerful Processes 85 MIKE DOOLEY The \\"hows\\" are the domain of the Universe. It always knows the shortest, quickest, fastest, most harmonious way between you and your dream. DR. JOE VITALE If you turn it over to the Universe, you will be surprised and dazzled by what is delivered to you. This is where magic and miracles happen. The teachers of The Secret are all aware of the elements you bring into play when you visualize. As you see the picture in your mind and feel it, you are bringing yourself to a place of believing you have it now. You are also implementing trust and faith in the Universe, because you are focusing on the end result and experiencing the feeling of that, without giving any attention whatsoever to \\"how\\" it will come about. Your picture in your mind is seeing it as done. Your feelings are seeing it as done. Your mind and your entire state of being are seeing it as already happened. That is the art of visualization. DR. JOE VITALE You want to do this virtually daily, but it should never be a chore. What's really important to the whole Secret is feeling good. You want to feel exhilarated by this whole process. You want to be high, happy, in tune, as much as possible. 86 The Secret Everyone has the power to visualize. Let me prove it to you with a picture of a kitchen. For this to work, first of all you have to get all thoughts of your kitchen out of your mind. Do not think of your kitchen. Totally clear your mind of pictures of your kitchen, with its cupboards, refrigerator, oven, tiles, and color scheme . . . You saw a picture of your kitchen in your mind, didn't you? Well, then you just visualized! \\"Everyone visualizes whether he knows it or not. Visualizing is the great secret of success.\\" Here's a tip about visualizing, which Dr. John Demartini shares in his Breakthrough Experience seminars. John said that if you create a static picture in your mind it can be difficult to hold that picture, so create lots of movement in your picture. To illustrate this, imagine your kitchen again, and this time imagine yourself entering that kitchen, walking to the refrigerator and putting your hand on the door handle, opening the door, looking inside, and finding a cold bottle of water. Reach in and grab it. You can feel the coldness on your hand as you grasp the bottle. You have the bottle of water in one hand, and you use your other hand to close the refrigerator door. Now that you are visualizing your kitchen with detail and movement it's easier to see and hold the picture, isn't it? Powerful Processes 87 \\"We all possess more power and greater possibilities than we realize, and visualizing is one of the greatest of these powers.\\" MARCI SHIMOFF The only difference between people who live in this way, who live in the magic of life, and those who don't is that the people who live in the magic of life have habituated ways of being. They've made a habit of using the law of attraction, and magic happens with them wherever they go. Because they remember to use it. They use it all the time, not just as a one-time event. Here are two true stories that clearly demonstrate the powerful law of attraction and the immaculate matrix of the Universe in action. The first story is about a woman named Jeannie, who bought a DVD of The Secret and was watching it at least once a day so that she would absorb the message right into the cells of her body. She was particularly impressed with Bob Proctor, and she thought it would be wonderful to meet him. One morning Jeannie collected her mail, and to her utter amaze-ment the mailman had accidentally delivered Bob Proctor's mail 88 The Secret to her address. What Jeannie didn't know is that Bob Proctor lived just four blocks away from her! Not only that, but Jeannie's house number was the same number as Bob's. She immediately took the mail to deliver it to the correct address. Can you imagine her utter delight when the door opened and Bob Proctor was standing before her? Bob is rarely at home as he travels all over the world teaching, but the matrix of the Universe knows only perfect timing. From Jeannie's thought of how wonderful it would be to meet Bob Proctor, the law of attraction moved people, circumstances, and events throughout the Universe so that it happened. The second story involves a ten-year-old boy named Colin, who had seen and loved The Secret. Colin's family made a weeklong visit to Disney World, and on their first day they experienced long lines at the park. So that night, just before Colin fell asleep, he thought, \\"Tomorrow I'd love to go on all the big rides and never have to wait in line.\\" The next morning, Colin and his family were at the gates of Epcot Center as the park opened, and a Disney staff member approached and asked them if they would be Epcot's First Family of the Day. As First Family they would be given VIP status, a special escort by a staff member, and walk-on passes for every big ride in Epcot. It was everything and more that Colin had wished for! Hundreds of families were waiting to enter Epcot that morning, but Colin didn't have the slightest doubt as to why his family had been chosen First Family. He knew it was because he had used The Secret. Powerful Processes 89 Imagine discovering—at the age of ten—that the power to move worlds lies within you! \\"Nothing can prevent your picture from coming into concrete form except the same power which gave it birth—yourself.\\" JAMES RAY People hold that for a while; and they're really a champion at it. They say, \\"I'm fired up. I saw this program and I'm going to change my life.\\" And yet results aren't showing. Beneath the surface it's just about ready to break through, but the person will look just at the surface results and say, \\"This stuff doesn 't work.\\" And you know what? The Universe says, \\"Your wish is my command,\\" and it disappears. When you allow a thought of doubt to enter your mind, the law of attraction will soon line up one doubtful thought after another. The moment a thought of doubt comes, release it immediately. Send that thought on its way. Replace it with \\"I know I am receiving now.\\" And feel it. JOHN ASSARAF Knowing the law of attraction, I wanted to really put it to use and to see what would happen. In 1995 I started to create something called a Vision Board, where I take something that The Secret I want to achieve, or something that I want to attract, like a car or a watch or the soul mate of my dreams, and I put a picture of what I want up on this board. Every day I would sit in my office and I would look up at this board and I would start to visualize. I would really get into the state of having already acquired it. I was getting ready to move. We put all the furniture, all the boxes, into storage, and I made three different moves over a period of five years. And then I ended up in California and bought this house, renovated it for a year, and then had all the stuff brought from my farmer home five years earlier. One morning my son Keenan came into my office, and one of the boxes that was sealed for five years was right at the doorstep. He asked, \\"What's in the boxes, Daddy?\\" And I said, \\"Those are my Vision Boards/' He then asked, \\"What's a Vision Board?\\" I said, \\"Well, it's where I put alt my goals up. I cut them out and I put all my goals up as something that I want to achieve in my life.\\" Of course at five and a half years old he didn't understand, and so I said, \\"Sweetheart, let me just show you, that'll be the easiest way to do it.\\" I cut the box open, and on one Vision Board was a picture of a home that I was visualizing five years earlier. What was shocking was that we were living in that house. Not a house like it—I actually bought my dream home, renovated it, and didn't even know it. I looked at that house and I started to cry, because I was just blown away. Keenan asked, \\"Why are you crying?\\" \\"I finally understand how the law of attraction P o w e r f u l Processes 91 works. I finally understand the power of visualization. I finally understand everything that I've read, everything that I've worked with my whole life, the way I've built companies. It worked for my home as well, and I bought our dream home and didn 't even know it.\\" \\"Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\\" You can let your imagination go wild with a Vision Board, and place pictures of all the things you want, and pictures of how you want your life to be. Make sure you put the Vision Board in a place where you see it and look at it every day as John Assaraf did. Feel the feelings of having those things now. As you receive, and feel gratitude for receiving, you can remove pictures and add new ones. This is a wonderful way to introduce children to the law of attraction. I hope the creation of a Vision Board inspires parents and teachers worldwide. One of the people on The Secret website Forum put a picture of The Secret DVD on his Vision Board. He had seen The Secret but didn't own his own copy. Two days after he created his Vision Board, I felt inspired to post a notice on The Secret Forum giving away DVDs to the first ten people who posted. He was one of the ten! He had received a copy of The Secret DVD within two days of putting it on his Vision Board. Whether it is a DVD of The Secret or a house, the joy of creating and receiving is magnificent! 92 The Secret Another powerful example of visualizing comes from my mother's experience of buying a new house. Several people besides my mother had put in offers for this particular house. My mother decided to use The Secret to make that house hers. She sat down and wrote her name and the new address of the house over and over. She continued doing this until it felt as though it was her address. She then imagined placing all of her furniture in that new house. Within hours of doing these things, she received a phone call saying her offer had been accepted. She was so thrilled, but it didn't come as a surprise to her because she knew that house was hers. What a champion! JACK CAN FIELD Decide what you want. Believe you can have it. Believe you deserve it and believe it's possible for you. And then close your eyes every day for several minutes, and visualize having what you already want, feeling the feelings of already having it. Come out of that and focus on what you're grateful for already, and really enjoy it. Then go into your day and release it to the Universe and trust that the Universe will figure out how to manifest it. Expectation is a powerful attractive force. Expect the things you want, and don't expect the things you don't want. Gratitude is a powerful process for shifting your energy and bringing more of what you want into your life. Be grateful for what you already have, and you will attract more good things. Giving thanks for what you want in advance turbo-charges your desires and sends a more powerful signal out into the Universe. Visualization is the process of creating pictures in your mind of yourself enjoying what you want. When you visualize, you generate powerful thoughts and feelings of having it now. The law of attraction then returns that reality to you, just as you saw it in your mind. To use the law of attraction to your advantage, make it a habitual way of being, not just a one-time event. At the end of every day, before you go to sleep, go back through the events of the day. Any events or moments that were not what you wanted, replay them in your mind the way you wanted them to go. 93 \\"Whatever the mind . . . can conceive it can achieve.\\" JACK CANFIELD The Secret was a real transformation for me, because I grew up with a very negative father who thought that rich people were people that had ripped everyone off and thought that anyone that had money must have deceived somebody. So I grew up with a lot of beliefs about money; that if you had it, it made you bad, only evil people have money, and money doesn't grow on trees. \\"Who do you think I am, Rockefeller?' That was one of his favorite phrases. So I grew up truly believing that life was difficult. It was only when I met W. Clement Stone that I began to shift my life. 95 96 The Secret When I was working with Stone he said, \\"I want you to set a goal that's so big that if you achieved it, it would blow your mind, and you would knew it's only because of what I've taught you that you would have achieved this goal\\" At the time I was making about eight thousand dollars a year, so I said, \\"I want to make a hundred thousand dollars in a year.\\" Now, I had no idea how I could do that. I saw no strategy, no possibility, but I just said, \\"I'm going to declare that, I'm going to believe it, I'm going to act as if it's true, and release it\\" So I did that. One of the things he taught me was every day to close your eyes and visualize the goals as if it's already achieved. I had actually made a hundred-thousand-dollar bill that I'd put on the ceiling. So first thing in the morning I'd look up and there it was, and it would remind me that this was my intention. Then I would close my eyes and visualize having this hundred-thousand-dollar-a-year lifestyle. Interestingly enough, nothing major happened for about thirty days. I didn't have any great breakthrough ideas, no one was offering me more money. About four weeks into it, I had a hundred-thousand-dollar idea. It just came right into my head. I had a book I had written, and I said, \\"If I can sell four hundred thousand copies of my book at a quarter each, that'd be a hundred thousand dollars.\\" Now, the book was there, but I never had this thought. (One of The Secrets is that when you have an inspired thought, you have to trust it and act on it.) I didn't know how I was going to sell four hundred thousand copies. The Secret to Money Then I saw the National Enquirer at the supermarket. I had seen that millions of times and it was just background. And all of a sudden it jumped out at me as foreground. I thought, \\"If readers knew about my book, certainly four hundred thousand people would go out and buy it.\\" About six weeks later I gave a talk at Hunter College in New York to six hundred teachers, and afterward a woman approached me and said, \\"That was a great talk. I want to interview you. Let me give you my card.\\" As it turns out, she was a freelance writer who sold her stories to the National Enquirer. The theme from \\"The Twilight Zone\\" went off in my head, like, whoah, this stuff's really working. That article came out and our book sales started to take off. The point I want to make is that I was attracting into my life all these different events, including this person. To make a long story short, I did not make a hundred thousand dollars that year. We made ninety-two thousand three hundred and twenty-seven dollars. But do you think we were depressed and saying, \\"This doesn't work\\"? No, we were saying, \\"This is amazing!\\" So my wife said to me, \\"If it works for a hundred thousand, do you think it'd work for a million ?\\" And I said, \\"I don't know, I think so. Let's try it.\\" My publisher wrote me a royalty check for our first Chicken Soup for the Soul book. And he actually put a smiley face in his signature, because it was the first million-dollar check he'd ever written. 98 The Secret So I know from my own experience, became I wanted to test it Does this Secret really work? We put it to the test. It absolutely worked, and now I live my life from that every single day. The knowledge of The Secret and the intentional use of the law of attraction can be applied to every single subject in your life. It is the same process for everything you want to create, and the subject of money is no different. To attract money, you must focus on wealth. It is impossible to bring more money into your life when you are noticing you do not have enough, because that means you are thinking thoughts that you do not have enough. Focus on not enough money, and you will create untold more circumstances of not having enough money. You must focus on the abundance of money to bring that to you. You have to emit a new signal with your thoughts, and those thoughts should be that you currently have more than enough. You really do need to call your imagination into play and make believe you already have the money you want. And it is so much fun to do! You will notice as you pretend and play games of having wealth that you feel instantly better about money, and as you feel better about it, it will begin to flow into your life. Jack's wonderful story inspired The Secret Team to create a blank check available as a free download on The Secret website, www .thesecret.tv. The blank check is for you, and it is from the Bank of the Universe. You fill in your name, the amount, and details, and place it in a prominent place where you will see it every day. When The Secret to Money 99 you look at the check, feel the feelings of having that money now. Imagine spending that money, all the things you will buy and the things you will do. Feel how wonderful that is! Know it is yours, because when you ask, it is. We have received hundreds of stories from people who have brought huge sums of money to them using The Secret check. It's a fun game that works! The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are blocking money from coming to them with their thoughts. Every negative thought, feeling, or emotion is blocking your good from coming to you, and that includes money. It is not that the money is being kept from you by the Universe, because all the money you require exists right now in the invisible. If you do not have enough, it is because you are stopping the flow of money coming to you, and you are doing that with your thoughts. You must tip the balance of your thoughts from lack-of-money to more-than-enough-money. Think more thoughts of abundance than of lack, and you have tipped the balance. When you need money, it is a powerful feeling within you, and so of course through the law of attraction you will continue to attract needing money. I can speak from experience about money, because just before I discovered The Secret my accountants told me that my company 100 The Secret had suffered a major loss that year, and in three months it would be history. After ten years of hard work, my company was about to slip through my fingers. And as I needed more money to save my company, things just got worse. There seemed no way out. Then I discovered The Secret, and everything in my life—including the state of my company—was totally transformed, because I changed the way I was thinking. As my accountants continued to fuss about the figures and focus on that, I kept my mind focused on abundance and all being well. I knew with every fiber of my being that the Universe would provide, and it did. It provided in ways I could not have imagined. I had my moments of doubt, but when the doubt came I immediately moved my thoughts to the outcome of what I wanted. I gave thanks for it, I felt the joy of it, and I believed. I want to let you in on a secret to The Secret. The shortcut to anything you want in your life is to BE and FEEL happy now! It is the fastest way to bring money and anything else you want into your life. Focus on radiating out into the Universe those feelings of joy and happiness. When you do that, you will attract back to you all things that bring you joy and happiness, which will not only include an abundance of money, but everything else you are wanting. You must radiate out the signal to bring back what you want. As you radiate out those feelings of happiness, they will be sent back to you as the pictures and experiences of your life. The law of attraction is reflecting back your innermost thoughts and feelings as your life. The Secret to Money 101 DR. JOE VITALE / can imagine what a lot of people are thinking: \\"How can I attract more money into my life? How can I get more of the green stuff? How can I get more of wealth and prosperity? How can I, when I love my job, deal with the credit card debt that I have, and the realization that maybe there's a ceiling on the money that can come in, cause it's coming to me through my job? How can I bring in more?\\" Intend it! This goes back to one of the things we've been talking about throughout the whole Secret. Your job is to declare what you would like to have from the catalogue of the Universe. If cash is one of them, say how much you would like to have. \\"I would like to have twenty-five thousand dollars, unexpected income, within the next thirty days,\\" or whatever it happens to be. It should be believable for you. If you have held thoughts in the past that the only way money can come to you is through your job, then let that go immediately. Can you appreciate that as you continue to think that, it must be your experience? Such thoughts do not serve you. You are now coming to understand that there is abundance for you, and it is not your job to work out \\"how\\" the money will come to you. It is your job to ask, to believe you are receiving, and feel 102 The Secret happy now. Leave the details to the Universe on how it will bring it about. BOB PROCTOR Most people have a goal of getting out of debt. That will keep you in debt forever. Whatever you're thinking about, you will attract. You say, \\"But it's get out of debt.\\" I don't care if it's get out or get in, if you're thinking debt, you're attracting debt. Set up an automatic debt repayment program and then start to focus on prosperity. When you have a pile of bills that you have no idea how you are going to pay you cannot focus on those bills, because you will continue to attract more bills. You have to find a way that works for you to focus on prosperity despite the bills around you. You have to find a way of feeling good, so you can bring your good to you. JAMES RAY So many times people say to me, \\"I'd like to double my income in the next year.\\" But then you look at their actions and they're not doing the things that are going to make that happen. They'll turn right around and they'll say, \\"I can't afford that.\\" Guess what? \\"Your wish is my command.\\" If the words \\"I can't afford it\\" have passed your lips/ your power to change that is now. Change it with, \\"I can afford that! I can buy that!\\" Say it over and over. Become like a parrot. For the next","output":"From the text about using the Creative Process for weight loss and attracting abundance (including money), I learned several key points: 1. Focus on your desired outcome, not the absence of it. For weight loss, instead of focusing on needing to lose weight, focus on your perfect weight and the feeling of achieving it. 2. Thoughts and feelings are powerful attractors. \\"Fat thoughts\\" attract more weight; \\"thin thoughts\\" attract weight loss. Similarly, focusing on lack of money will attract more lack, while focusing on abundance will attract wealth. 3. The law of attraction is always working, so it's important to consciously direct your thoughts towards what you want instead of what you don't want. 4. Visualization and gratitude are essential tools. Visualize your goals as if they have already been achieved and practice gratitude for what you have and for what is coming. 5. Small acts of belief, like placing a check from the Universe in a visible spot or creating a vision board, can help solidify your intentions and make them feel more tangible. 6. Consistency and feeling good are key. The more consistently you can maintain positive thoughts and feelings about your goals, the faster you will manifest them. To implement these learnings in daily life: 1. Replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations. For instance, if I catch myself thinking, \\"I'll never be fit,\\" I'll immediately switch that to \\"I am achieving my perfect weight easily and joyfully.\\" 2. Begin and end each day with gratitude. List things I'm thankful for to keep my focus on abundance and what brings joy. 3. Create a vision board with pictures of my goals, look at it daily, and feel the emotions associated with already having achieved those goals. 4. Practice visualization exercises where I imagine my life as I want it to be, feeling all the emotions of having achieved my goals. 5. Avoid phrases like \\"I can't afford it\\" and replace them with \\"I can afford that\\" or \\"Money comes to me easily and frequently.\\" 6. Believe in the process and trust that the Universe will deliver what I focus on, without worrying about the \\"how.\\" 7. Incorporate playfulness and fun into the process of manifesting to keep the energy light and the frequency high. 8. Be patient and understand that manifestation may not happen instantly. Trust in the right timing and continue to focus on positive outcomes. 9. Whenever negative circumstances arise, use the revision technique by Neville Goddard to replay events in my mind the way I wish they had occurred to reset my frequency."},{"instruction":"more","output":"To expand on the teachings about using the Creative Process for weight loss and attracting abundance, and to provide more ways to implement these teachings, consider the following additional insights and practices: **Understanding the Law of Attraction and Weight Loss:** - Your body responds to your thoughts and feelings, so if you desire weight loss, think and feel fit. - Instead of counting calories or focusing on dieting, visualize your body as you wish it to be and take actions aligned with that vision. - Speak positively about your body and weight journey, affirming your health and success. **Implementing Weight Loss Attraction:** - Engage in daily affirmations that reinforce your ideal weight and body image. - Choose physical activities that you enjoy, as joy increases positive frequency and helps attract your desires. - Practice mindful eating, savoring each bite with gratitude and presence, as this can align you with your weight goals. **Understanding the Law of Attraction and Abundance:** - To attract money and abundance, focus on the flow of wealth in your life, disregarding current financial limitations. - Align your actions with wealth creation—look for opportunities and take inspired action. - Appreciate the abundance around you, even if it's not in the form of money, as this sets the stage for more abundance. **Implementing Abundance Attraction:** - Regularly jot down financial goals and describe your life as if you're already experiencing this wealth. - Develop a prosperity mindset by educating yourself about money management and investments, aligning knowledge with the law of attraction. - Consciously choose to redirect any thoughts of financial worry or stress to thoughts of financial success and stability. **General Practices for Law of Attraction:** - Use meditation to clear your mind and focus on your intentions without resistance. - Keep a journal to track your thoughts, feelings, and progress.

I am fighting in an exhibition match against Lily, a cheeky and sassy 10 year old girl who’s the champion of the kids division. The rules of the duel are as such. At each turn, we cast an artistic and glamorous spell and the judges give points for the beauty of the spell. We’re not allowed to cast the same spell more than once. We share the same list of spells, so once one of us uses a spell, it can't be repeated in the duel. Use a dice roll to determine Lily and my success when casting spells. The dice is 1-20. Make a list of 20 spells that Lily and I have access to. Assign a range of dice roll number that is required to succeed in a spell and assign how many points each spell would receive. High level spells should have higher points than lower level spells, but also they require a higher threshold of a dice roll. Make it so that there’s a lower range required to produce a spell, and an upper range for perfect casting, and perfect casting earns a higher number of points for a spell than just merely producing it. At the start of the match, though, Lily sneakily casts on me a spell that makes me regress in age by 1 year every time I cast a spell. For every year that I regress, add a -1 penalty to my dice roll. Roll the dice for me. Do Lily's turn after my turn. Give Lily the strategy of using the low dice spells in the first few turns, so once my penalty is too big to cast the high roll spells, I won't be able to cast the low roll spells either because Lily already used them. I control Sapphire and her dialogue and actions. Have Lily add dialogue throughout the duel. What 20 spells do we have access to?","output":"Here is a list of 20 spells available to both Lily and Sapphire, which require varying degrees of skill and finesse to cast successfully. The number in parentheses represents the number of points available for each spell, with bonus points for a perfectly cast spell. 1. **Whisperwind Ballet** (2-12, requires 1-10 for success, 11-20 for perfect casting) [1-2 points] 2. **Aurora Veil** (3-13, requires 2-11 for success, 12-20 for perfect casting) [2-3 points] 3. **Glimmering Mirage** (4-14, requires 3-12 for success, 13-20 for perfect casting) [3-4 points] 4. **Shimmering Ribbons** (5-15, requires 4-13 for success, 14-20 for perfect casting) [4-5 points] 5. **Cascade of Moonbeams** (6-16, requires 5-14 for success, 15-20 for perfect casting) [5-6 points] 6. **Dance of the Fireflies** (7-17, requires 6-15 for success, 16-20 for perfect casting) [6-7 points] 7. **Radiant Blossom** (8-18, requires 7-16 for success, 17-20 for perfect casting) [7-8 points] 8. **Twilight Serenade** (9-19, requires 8-17 for success, 18-20 for perfect casting) [8-9 points] 9. **Mystic Aurora** (10-20, requires 9-18 for success, 19-20 for perfect casting) [9-10 points] 10. **Starlight Spiral** (11-21, requires 10-19 for success, 20 for perfect casting) [10-11 points] 11. **Luminous Labyrinth** (12-22, requires 11-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [11-12 points] 12. **Glacial Waltz** (13-23, requires 12-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [12-13 points] 13. **Phoenix's Rebirth** (14-24, requires 13-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [13-14 points] 14. **Celestial Cascade** (15-25, requires 14-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [14-15 points] 15. **Sunset Symphony** (16-26, requires 15-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [15-16 points] 16. **Nebula Veil** (17-27, requires 16-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [16-17 points] 17. **Dragon's Majesty** (18-28, requires 17-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [17-18 points] 18. **Eclipse Elegy** (19-29, requires 18-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [18-19 points] 19. **Galactic Gale** (20-30, requires 19-20 for success, clear perfection not achievable) [19-20 points] 20. **Arcane Rhapsody** (21-31, requires 20-20 for success, cannot be cast perfectly) [20-21 points] As the duel begins, Sapphire approaches the center of the stage, giving her opponent, Lily, a respectful nod. She's unaware that the cheeky 10-year-old has already set a devious spell in motion to undo Sapphire's advantage. Sapphire, in her poised stance, feels the arcane energy within her, ready to awe the judges. She selects her first spell, determined to set a high standard for the match. However, before she can act, Lily looks at her with a grin and says slyly, \\"I'm just a kid, but I bet your mind's as playful as mine after I cast this teeny, tiny spell. Ready to have some fun, 'big' sis?\\" Little does Sapphire know, the spell reducing her age with each casting has been weaved into the fabric of her being. The exhibition match takes on a new edge with each turn Sapphire takes. Let's roll the dice for Sapphire's first spell to see how successful she is, considering the penalty set by Lily's spell will come into effect after her first attempt. **Sapphire's First Turn:** Rolling the dice for Sapphire... (1-20) *Sapphire rolls a 15.* For her first spell, Sapphire selects **Radiant Blossom**, a spell that requires a roll of 7-16 for success and can earn her up to 8 points if perfectly cast. Sapphire's roll of 15 is within the success range and earns her a perfect casting score! Sapphire: \\"Let's set the stage with a bloom of light!\\" *With a flourish of her hand, vivid flowers made of pure light erupt around the arena.* Being her first spell, there is no penalty applied. Sapphire earns the full 8 points for her spell. **Lily's First Turn:** Now, Lily, taking the strategy of using low dice roll spells, decides to cast **Whisperwind Ballet**. Rolling the dice for Lily... (1-20) *Lily rolls a 12.* Lily successfully casts the spell with beautiful precision, earning herself 2 points but not a perfect casting. Lily, with a gleeful smile: \\"Hehe, watch how the winds dance at my command, Sapphy!\\" With the turns set, the duel is in full swing and the age regression spell takes effect on Sapphire, who feels a slight diminishing of her magical prowess as she's now effectively 15 years old. **Sapphire's Second Turn:** Now, Sapphire must cast her second spell with a -1 penalty added to her dice roll. Rolling the dice for Sapphire... (1-20) *Sapphire rolls a 14.* Applying the penalty, Sapphire's effective roll is a 13. She attempts **Twilight Serenade** which requires an 8-17 roll for a successful casting. Sapphire casts the spell successfully and earns herself 9 points, but without the bonus for a perfect casting. Sapphire, trying to ignore the slight disorientation from regressing in age, says with determination, \\"The dance of dusk—let twilight envelop us in serenity.\\" Lily's cheeky behavior and strategy unfold, setting the tone for a challenging yet captivating match."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your message might have been cut off!

How can I, when I love my job, deal with the credit card debt that I have, and the realization that maybe there's a ceiling on the money that can come in, cause it's coming to me through my job? How can I bring in more?\\" Intend it! This goes back to one of the things we've been talking about throughout the whole Secret. Your job is to declare what you would like to have from the catalogue of the Universe. If cash is one of them, say how much you would like to have. \\"I would like to have twenty-five thousand dollars, unexpected income, within the next thirty days,\\" or whatever it happens to be. It should be believable for you. If you have held thoughts in the past that the only way money can come to you is through your job, then let that go immediately. Can you appreciate that as you continue to think that, it must be your experience? Such thoughts do not serve you. You are now coming to understand that there is abundance for you, and it is not your job to work out \\"how\\" the money will come to you. It is your job to ask, to believe you are receiving, and feel 102 The Secret happy now. Leave the details to the Universe on how it will bring it about. BOB PROCTOR Most people have a goal of getting out of debt. That will keep you in debt forever. Whatever you're thinking about, you will attract. You say, \\"But it's get out of debt.\\" I don't care if it's get out or get in, if you're thinking debt, you're attracting debt. Set up an automatic debt repayment program and then start to focus on prosperity. When you have a pile of bills that you have no idea how you are going to pay you cannot focus on those bills, because you will continue to attract more bills. You have to find a way that works for you to focus on prosperity despite the bills around you. You have to find a way of feeling good, so you can bring your good to you. JAMES RAY So many times people say to me, \\"I'd like to double my income in the next year.\\" But then you look at their actions and they're not doing the things that are going to make that happen. They'll turn right around and they'll say, \\"I can't afford that.\\" Guess what? \\"Your wish is my command.\\" If the words \\"I can't afford it\\" have passed your lips/ your power to change that is now. Change it with, \\"I can afford that! I can buy that!\\" Say it over and over. Become like a parrot. For the next The Secret to Money 103 thirty days, make it your intention that you are going to look at everything you like and say to yourself, \\"I can afford that. I can buy that.\\" As you see your dream car drive past, say, \\"I can afford that.\\" As you see clothes you love, as you think about a great vacation, say, \\"I can afford that.\\" As you do this you will begin to shift yourself and you will begin to feel better about money. You will begin to convince yourself that you can afford those things, and as you do, the pictures of your life will change. LISA NICHOLS When you focus on lack and scarcity and what you don't have, you fuss about it with your family, you discuss it with your friends, you tell your children that you don't have enough —\\"'We don't have enough for that, we can't afford that\\"—then you'll never be able to afford it, because you begin to attract more of what you don't have. If you want abundance, if you want prosperity, then focus on abundance. Focus on prosperity. \\"The spiritual substance from which comes all visible wealth is never depleted. It is right with you all the time and responds to your faith in it and your demands on it.\\" Now that you know The Secret, when you see someone who is wealthy you will know that that person's predominant thoughts 104 The Secret are on wealth and not on scarcity, and that they have drawn wealth to them—whether they did it consciously or unconsciously. They focused on thoughts of wealth and the Universe moved people, circumstances, and events to deliver wealth to them. The wealth that they have, you have also. The only difference between you and them is that they thought the thoughts to bring the wealth to them. Your wealth is waiting for you in the invisible, and to bring it into the visible, think wealth! DAVID SCHIRMER When I first understood The Secret, every day I would get a bunch of bills in the mail I thought, \\"How do I turn this around?\\" The law of attraction states that what you focus on you will get, so I got a bank statement, I whited out the total, and I put a new total in there. I put exactly how much I wanted to see in the bank. So I thought, \\"What if I just visualized checks coming in the mail?\\" So I just visualized a bunch of checks coming in the mail Within just one month, things started to change. It is amazing; today I just get checks in the mail. I get a few bills, but I get more checks than bills. Since the film The Secret was released, we have received hundreds and hundreds of letters from people who have said that since watching the film they have received unexpected checks in the mail. And it happened because as they gave their focus and attention to David's story, they brought checks to them. The Secret to Money 105 A game I created that helped shift my feelings about my pile of bills was to pretend that the bills were actually checks. I would jump for joy as I opened them and say, \\"More money for me! Thank you. Thank you.\\" I took each bill, imagined it was a check, and then I added a zero to it in my mind to make it even more. I got a notepad and wrote at the top of the page \\"I have received,\\" and then I would list all the amounts of the bills with an added zero. Next to each amount I would write \\"Thank you,\\" and feel the feelings of gratitude for receiving it—to the point where I had tears in my eyes. Then I would take each bill, which looked very small compared to what I had received, and I would pay it with gratitude! I never opened my bills until I had got myself into the feeling that they were checks, if I opened my bills before convincing myself they were checks, my stomach would churn when I opened them. I knew that the emotion of the churning in my stomach was powerfully bringing more bills. I knew I had to erase that feeling, and replace it with joyful feelings, so I could bring more money into my life. In the face of a pile of bills, that game worked for me, and it changed my life. There are so many games you can create, and you will know what works best for you by the way you feel inside. When you make-believe, the results come fast! 106 The Secret LORAL LANGEMEIER F I N A N C I A L STRATEGIST, SPEAKER, A N D PERSONAL A N D CORPORATE C O A C H I grew up on, \\"You have to work hard for money.\\" So I replaced that with, \\"Money comes easily and frequently.\\" Now in the beginning it feels like a lie, right? There is a part of your brain that will say, \\"Oh you liar, it's hard.\\" So you have to know it's this little tennis match that will go on for a while. If you have had thoughts of, \\"I have to work really hard and struggle to have money,\\" let them go immediately. By thinking those thoughts you emitted that frequency, and they became the pictures of your life experience. Take Loral Langemeier's advice, and replace those thoughts with, \\"Money comes easily and frequently.\\" D A V I D SCHIRMER When it comes to creating wealth, wealth is a mindset. It's all about how you think. LORAL LANGEMEIER I'd say 80 percent of the coaching that I do with folks is about their psychology and the way they think. I know when people say, \\"Oh, you can do it, I can't.\\" People have the capability to change their inner relationship and conversation with money. The Secret to Money 107 \\"The good news is that the moment you decide that what you know is more important than what you have been taught to believe, you will have shifted gears in your quest for abundance. Success comes from within, not from without.\\" You have got to feel good about money to attract more to you. Un-derstandably when people do not have enough money they do not feel good about money, because they don't have enough. But those negative feelings about money are stopping more money coming to you! You have got to stop the cycle, and you stop it by starting to feel good about money, and being grateful for what you have. Start to say and feet, \\"I have more than enough.\\" \\"There is an abundance of money and it's on its way to me.\\" \\"I am a money magnet.\\" \\"I love money and money loves me.\\" \\"I am receiving money every day.\\" \\"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you/' Giving is a powerful action to bring more money into your life, because when you are giving you are saying, \\"I have plenty.\\" It will not be surprising to you to learn that the wealthiest people on the planet are the greatest philanthropists. They give away vast 108 The Secret amounts of money, and as they give, by the law of attraction, the Universe opens up and floods vast amounts of money back to them —multiplied! If you are thinking, \\"I don't have enough money to give,\\" bingo! Now you know why you don't have enough money! When you think you don't have enough to give, start giving. As you demonstrate faith in giving, the law of attraction must give you more to give. There is a big difference between giving and sacrificing. Giving from a heart that is overflowing feels so good. Sacrificing does not feel good. Don't confuse the two—they are diametrically opposed. One emits a signal of lack and the other emits a signal of more-than-enough. One feels good and one does not feel good. Sacrifice will eventually lead to resentment. Giving from a full heart is one of the most joyous things you can do, and the law of attraction will grab hold of that signal and flood even more into your life. You can feet the difference. I find so many people who make a tremendous amount of money, but their relationships stink. And that's not wealth. You can go after the money and you might get rich, but it doesn't guarantee you'll be wealthy. I'm not suggesting that money isn't a part of wealth, it absolutely is. But it's only a part. The Secret to Money 109 And then I meet a lot of people who are \\"spiritual\\" but they're sick and broke all the time. That's not wealth either. Life is meant to be abundant—in all areas. If you have been brought up to believe that being wealthy is not spiritual, then I highly recommend you read The Millionaires of the Bible Series by Catherine Ponder. In these glorious books you will discover that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and Jesus were not only prosperity teachers, but also millionaires themselves, with more affluent lifestyles than many present-day millionaires could conceive of. You are the heir to the kingdom. Prosperity is your birthright, and you hold the key to more abundance—in every area of your life— than you can possibly imagine. You deserve every good thing you want, and the Universe will give you every good thing you want, but you have to summon it into your life. Now you know The Secret. You have the key. The key is your thoughts and feelings, and you have been holding the key in your hand all of your life. MARCI SHIMOFF Many people in Western culture are striving for success. They want the great home, they want their businesses to work, they want all these outer things. But what we found in our research is that having these outer things does not necessarily guarantee what we really want, which is happiness. So we go for these outer things thinking they're going to bring us 110 The Secret happiness, but it's backward. You need to go for the inner joy, the inner peace, the inner vision first, and then all of the outer things appear. Everything you want is an inside job! The outside world is the world of effects; if s just the result of thoughts. Set your thoughts and frequency on happiness. Radiate the feelings of happiness and joy within you, and transmit that into the Universe with all of your might, and you will experience true heaven on earth. • To attract money, focus on wealth. It is impossible to bring more money into your life when you focus on the lack of it. • It is helpful to use your imagination and make-believe you already have the money you want. Play games of having wealth and you will feel better about money; as you feel better about it, more will flow into your life. • Feeling happy now is the fastest way to bring money into your life. • Make it your intention to look at everything you like and say to yourself, \\"I can afford that. I can buy that.\\" You will shift your thinking and begin to feel better about money. • Give money in order to bring more of it into your life. When you are generous with money and feel good about sharing it, you are saying, \\"I have plenty.\\" • Visualize checks in the mail. • Tip the balance of your thoughts to wealth. Think wealth. MARIE D I A M O N D FENG SHUI CONSULTANT, TEACHER, AND SPEAKER The Secret means that we are creators of our Universe, and that every wish that we want to create will manifest in our lives. Therefore, our wishes, thoughts, and feelings are very important because they will manifest. One day I went into the home of an art director, a very famous film producer. In every corner he had this beautiful image of a naked woman draped with a fabric, kind of turning away as if she were saying, \\"I don't see you.\\" I said to him, \\"I think you might have trouble in your romance.\\" And he said, \\"Are you clairvoyant?\\" \\"No, but look. In seven places, you have exactly that same woman.\\" He said, \\"But I love that kind of painting. I painted it myself.\\" I said, \\"That's even worse because you put all your creation and creativity in it.\\" 114 The Secret He's a gorgeous-looking man with all these actresses around him because that's the work he does, and he doesn't have any romance. I asked him, \\"What do you want?\\" \\"I want to date three women a week.\\" I said, \\"OK, paint it. Paint yourself with three women, and hang it in every corner of your living space.\\" Six months later I saw him and asked, \\"How is your love life?\\" \\"Great! Women call me, they want to date me.\\" \\"Because that's your wish,\\" I said. He said, \\"I feel great. I mean, for years I did not have a date and now I have three dates a week. They're fighting over me.\\" \\"Good for you,\\" I said. Then he told me, \\"I really want to stabilize. I want marriage now, I want romance.\\" I said, \\"Well, then paint it.\\" He painted a beautiful romantic relationship, and a year later he got married, and he's very happy. This is because he put another wish out. He wished it in himself for years without it happening because his wish could not manifest. The outer level of himself—his house—was contradicting his wish all the time. So if you understand this knowledge, you just start playing with it. Marie Diamond's story of her client is a perfect demonstration of how Feng Shui reflects the teachings of The Secret. It illustrates how our thoughts create powerfully when we put them into action. Any action we take must be preceded by a thought. Thoughts create the words we speak, the feelings we feel, and our actions. Actions are particularly powerful because they are thoughts that have caused us to act. The Secret to Relationships 115 We may not even realize what our innermost thoughts are, but we can see what we have been thinking by looking at the actions we have taken. In the story of the film producer, his innermost thoughts were reflected in his actions and surroundings. He had painted many women, all turning away from him. Can you see what his innermost thoughts were? Even though his words were saying he wanted to date more women, his innermost thoughts did not reflect that in his paintings. By deliberately choosing to change his actions, it caused him to focus his entire thought on what he wanted. With such a simple shift, he was able to paint his life and call it into existence through the law of attraction. When you want to attract something into your life, make sure your actions don't contradict your desires. One of the most wonderful examples of this is given by Mike Dooley, one of the teachers featured in The Secret, in his audio course, Leveraging the Universe and Engaging the Magic. It is a story of a woman who wanted to attract her perfect partner into her life. She had done all the right things: She got clear about what she wanted him to be like, made a detailed list of all of his qualities, and visualized him in her life. Despite doing all these things, there was no sign of him. Then one day as she arrived home and was parking her car in the middle of her garage, she gasped as she realized that her actions were contradicting what she wanted. If her car was in the middle of the garage, there was no room for her perfect partner's car! Her actions were powerfully saying to the Universe that she did not believe she was going to receive what she had asked for. So she immediately cleaned up her garage and parked her car to one side, 116 The Secret leaving space for her perfect partner's car on the other side. She then went into her bedroom and opened her wardrobe, which was jammed full of clothes. There was no room for her perfect partner's clothes. So she moved some of her clothes to make space. She had also been sleeping in the middle of her bed, and so she began sleeping on \\"her\\" side, leaving space for her partner. This woman related her story to Mike Dooley over a dinner, and sitting next to her at the table was her perfect partner. After taking all of these powerful actions and acting as if she had already received her perfect partner, he arrived in her life and they are now happily married. Another simple example of \\"acting as if\\" is a story of my sister Glenda, who is the production manager of the film The Secret. She was living and working in Australia, and she wanted to move to the United States and work with me in our U.S. office. Glenda knew The Secret very well, and so she was doing all the right things to bring forth what she wanted, but months were passing by and she was still in Australia. Glenda looked at her actions and realized she was not \\"acting as if\\" she was receiving what she had asked for. So she began to take powerful actions. She organized everything in her life for her de-parture. She canceled memberships, gave away things she would not need, and she got her suitcases out and packed them. Within four weeks, Glenda was in the United States working out of our U.S. office. The Secret to Relationships 117 Think about what you have asked for, and make sure that your actions are mirroring what you expect to receive, and that they're not contradicting what you've asked for. Act as if you are receiving it. Do exactly what you would do if you were receiving it today, and take actions in your life to reflect that powerful expectation. Make room to receive your desires, and as you do, you are sending out that powerful signal of expectation. LISA NICHOLS Inside relationships it's important to first understand who's coming into the relationship, and not just your partner. You need to understand yourself first. JAMES RAY How can you ever expect anyone else to enjoy your company if you don't enjoy your own company? And so again, the law of attraction or The Secret is about bringing that into your life. You 've got to get really, really clear. Here's the question I would ask you to consider: Do you treat yourself the way you want other people to treat you ? When you do not treat yourself the way you want others to treat you, you can never change the way things are. Your actions are your powerful thoughts, so if you do not treat yourself with 118 The Secret love and respect, you are emitting a signal that is saying you are not important enough, worthy enough, or deserving. That signal will continue to be broadcast, and you will experience more situations of people not treating you well. The people are just the effect. Your thoughts are the cause. You must begin to treat yourself with love and respect, and emit that signal and get on that frequency. Then the law of attraction will move the entire Universe, and your life will be full of people who love and respect you. Many people have sacrificed themselves for others, thinking when they sacrifice themselves they are being a good person. Wrong! To sacrifice yourself can only come from thoughts of absolute lack, because it is saying, \\"There is not enough for everyone, so I will go without\\" Those feelings do not feel good and will eventually lead to resentment. There is abundance for everybody and it is each person's responsibility to summon their own desires. You cannot summon for another person because you cannot think and feel for another. Your job is You, When you make feeling good a priority, that magnificent frequency will radiate and touch everyone close to you. DR. JOHN GRAY You become the solution for you. Don't point to another person and say, \\"Now you owe me and you need to give me more.\\" Instead, give more to yourself. Take time off to give to yourself, and in a sense to fill yourself up to fullness, to where now you can overflow in giving. The Secret to Relationships 119 \\"To acquire l o v e . . . fill yourself up with it until you become a magnet.\\" Many of us were taught to put ourselves last, and as a consequence we attracted feelings of being unworthy and undeserving. As those feelings lodged within us, we continued to attract more life situations that had us feel more unworthy and not enough. You must change that thinking. \\"Undoubtedly to some, the idea of giving so much love to self will seem very cold, hard and unmerciful. Still this matter may be seen in a different light, when we find that 'looking out for Number One,' as directed by the Infinite, is really looking out for Number Two and is indeed the only way to permanently benefit Number Two.\\" Unless you fill yourself up first, you have nothing to give anybody. Therefore it is imperative that you tend to You first. Attend to your joy first. People are responsible for their own joy. When you tend to your joy and do what makes you feel good, you are a joy to be around and you are a shining example to every child and every person in your life. When you are feeling joy you don't even have to think about giving. It is a natural overflow. 120 The Secret LISA NICHOLS I got into many relationships expecting my partner to show me my beauty, because I didn't see my own beauty. When I was growing up, my heroes or my \\"she-roes\\" were the Bionic Woman, Wonder Woman, and Charlie's Angels. And while they're wonderful, they didn't look like me. It wasn't until I fell in love with Lisa—I fell in love with my mocha skin, my full lips, my round hips, my curly black hair—it wasn't until that happened that the rest of the world was able to fall in love with me as well. The reason you have to love You is because it is impossible to feel good if you don't love You. When you feel bad about yourself, you are blocking all the love and all the good that the Universe has for you. When you feel bad about yourself it feels as though you are suck-ing the life out of you, because all of your good, on every single subject—including health, wealth, and love—is on the frequency of joy and feeling good. The feeling of having unlimited energy, and that amazing feeling of health and wellness, are all on the frequency of feeling good. When you don't feel good about You, you are on a frequency that is attracting more people, situations, and circumstances that will continue to make you feel bad about You. You must change your focus and begin to think about all the things that are wonderful about You. Look for the positives in You. As you focus on those things, the law of attraction will show you more great things about You. You attract what you think about. All you The Secret to Relationships 121 have to do is begin with one prolonged thought of something good about You, and the law of attraction will respond by giving You more like thoughts. Look for the good things about You. Seek and ye shall find! BOB PROCTOR There's something so magnificent about you. I have been studying me for forty-four years. I wanna kiss myself sometimes! Because you're going to get to love yourself. I'm not talking about conceit I'm talking about a healthy respect for yourself And as you love yourself, you'll automatically love others. MARCI SHIMOFF In relationships we're so used to complaining about other people. For instance, \\"My coworkers are so lazy, my husband makes me so mad, my children are so difficult.\\" It's always focusing on the other person. But for relationships to really work, we need to focus on what we appreciate about the other person, not what we're complaining about. When we're complaining about those things we're only getting more of those things. Even if you're having a really hard time in a relationship-things aren't working, you're not getting along, someone's in your face—you still can turn that relationship around. Take a piece of paper, and for the next thirty days sit down and write all the things that you appreciate about that person. Think about all the reasons that you love them. You appreciate their 122 The Secret sense of humor, you appreciate how supportive they are. And what you'll find is that when you focus on appreciating and acknowledging their strengths, that's what you'll get more of, and the problems will fade away. LISA NICHOLS Oftentimes you give others the opportunity to create your happiness, and many times they fail to create it the way you want it. Why? Because only one person can be in charge of your joy, of your bliss, and that's you. So even your parent, your child, your spouse—they do not have the control to create your happiness. They simply have the opportunity to share in your happiness. Your joy lies within you. All your joy is on the frequency of love—the highest and the most powerful frequency of all. You can't hold love in your hand. You can only feel it in your heart. It is a state of being. You can see evidence of love being expressed through people, but love is a feeling, and you are the only one that can radiate and emit that feeling of love. Your ability to generate feelings of love is unlimited, and when you love you are in complete and utter harmony with the Universe. Love everything you can. Love everyone you can. Focus only on things you love, feel love, and you will experience that love and joy coming back to you—multiplied! The law of attraction must send you back more things to love. As you radiate love, it will appear as though the entire Universe is doing everything for you, moving every joyful thing to you, and moving every good person to you. In truth, it is. • When you want to attract a relationship, make sure your thoughts, words, actions, and surroundings don't contradict your desires. • Your job is you. Unless you fill yourself up first, you have nothing to give anybody. • Treat yourself with love and respect, and you will attract people who show you love and respect. • When you feel bad about yourself, you block the love and instead you attract more people and situations that will continue to make you feel bad about you. • Focus on the qualities you love about yourself and the law of attra-tion will show you more great things about you. • To make a relationship work, focus on what you appreciate about the other person, and not your complaints. When you focus on the strengths, you will get more of them. 123 DR, JOHN HAGELIN QUANTUM PHYSICISTAND PUBLIC POLICY EXPERT Our body is really the product of our thoughts. We're beginning to understand in medical science the degree to which the nature of thoughts and emotions actually determines the physical substance and structure and function of our bodies. DR JOHN DEMARTINI We've known in the healing arts of a placebo effect. A placebo is something that supposedly has no impact and no effect on the body, like a sugar pill. You tell the patient that this is just as effective, and what happens is the placebo sometimes has the same effect, if not greater effect, than the medication that is supposed to be 126 The Secret designed for that effect. They have found out that the human mind is the biggest factor in the healing arts, sometimes more so than the medication. As you are becoming aware of the magnitude of The Secret, you will begin to see more clearly the underlying truth of certain occurrences in humankind, including in the area of health. The placebo effect is a powerful phenomenon. When patients think and truly believe the tablet is a cure, they will receive what they believe, and they will be cured. DR. JOHN DEMARTINI If somebody is in a situation where they're sick and they have an alternative to try to explore what is in their mind creating it, versus using medicine, if it's an acute situation that could really bring death to them, then obviously the medicine is a wise thing to do, while they explore what the mind is about. So you don't want to negate medicine. Every form of healing has a place. Healing through the mind can work harmoniously with medicine. If pain is involved, then medicine can help to eliminate that pain, which then allows the person to be able to focus with great force on health. \\"Thinking perfect health\\" is something anybody can do privately within themselves, no matter what is happening around them. LISA NICHOLS The Universe is a masterpiece of abundance. When you open yourself to feel the abundance of the Universe, you'll The Secret to Health 127 experience the wonder, joy, bliss, and all the great things that the Universe has for you —good health, good wealth, good nature. But when you shut yourself off with negative thoughts, you'll feel the discomfort, you'll feel the aches, you'll feel the pain, and you'll feel as if every day is painful to get through. DR. BEN JOHNSON PHYSICIAN, AUTHOR, AND LEADER IN ENERGY HEALING We've got a thousand different diagnoses and diseases out there. They're just the weak link. They're all the result of one thing: stress. If you put enough stress on the chain and you put enough stress on the system, then one of the links breaks. All stress begins with one negative thought. One thought that went unchecked, and then more thoughts came and more, until stress manifested. The effect is stress, but the cause was negative thinking, and it all began with one little negative thought. No matter what you might have manifested, you can change i t . . . with one small positive thought and then another. DR. JOHN DEMARTINI Our physiology creates disease to give us feedback, to let us know we have an imbalanced perspective, or we're not being loving and grateful. So the body's signs and symptoms are not something terrible. 128 The Secret Dr. Demartini is telling us that love and gratitude will dissolve all negativity in our lives, no matter what form it has taken. Love and gratitude can part seas, move mountains, and create miracles. And love and gratitude can dissolve any disease. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH The question frequently asked is, \\"When a person has manifested a disease in the body temple or some kind of discomfort in their life, can it be turned around through the power of 'right' thinking?\\" And the answer is absolutely, yes. CATHY GOODMAN, A PERSONAL STORY I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I truly believed in my heart, with my strong faith, that I was already healed. Each day I would say, \\"Thank you for my healing.\\" On and on and on I went, \\"Thank you for my healing.\\" I believed in my heart I was healed. I saw myself as if cancer was never in my body. One of the things I did to heal myself was to watch very funny movies. That's all we would do was just laugh, laugh, and laugh. We couldn't afford to put any stress in my life, because we knew stress was one of the worst things you can do while you're trying to heal yourself. The Secret to Health 129 From the time I was diagnosed to the time I was healed was approximately three months. And that's without any radiation or chemotherapy. This beautiful and inspiring story from Cathy Goodman demonstrates three magnificent powers in operation: The power of gratitude to heal, the power of faith to receive, and the power of laughter and joy to dissolve disease in our bodies. Cathy was inspired to include laughter as part of her healing, after hearing about the story of Norman Cousins. Norman had been diagnosed with an \\"incurable\\" disease. The doctors told him he had just a few months to live. Norman decided to heal himself. For three months all he did was watch funny movies and laugh, laugh, laugh. The disease left his body in those three months, and the doctors proclaimed his recovery a miracle. As he laughed, Norman released all negativity, and he released the disease. Laughter really is the best medicine. DR. BEN JOHNSON We all come with a built-in basic program. It's called \\"self-healing. \\" You get a wound, it grows back together. You get a bacterial infection, the immune system comes and takes care of those bacteria, and heals it up. The immune system is made to heal itself 130 The Secret B O B P R O C T O R Disease cannot live in a body that's in a healthy emotional state. Your body is casting off millions of cells every second, and it's also creating millions of new cells at the same time. DR. JOHN HAGELIN In fact, parts of our body are literally replaced every day. Other parts take a few months, other parts a couple of years. But within a few years we each have a brand new physical body. If our entire bodies are replaced within a few years, as science has proven, then how can it be that degeneration or illness remains in our bodies for years? It can only be held there by thought, by observation of the illness, and by the attention given to the illness. Think thoughts of perfection. Illness cannot exist in a body that has harmonious thoughts. Know there is only perfection, and as you observe perfection you must summon that to you. Imperfect thoughts are the cause of all humanity's ills, including disease, poverty, and unhappiness. When we think negative thoughts we are cutting ourselves off from our rightful heritage. Declare and intend, \\"I think perfect thoughts. I see only perfection. I am perfection.\\" The Secret to Health 131 I banished every bit of stiffness and lack of agility right out of my body. I focused on seeing my body as flexible and as perfect as a child's, and every stiff and aching joint vanished. I literally did this overnight. You can see that beliefs about aging are all in our minds. Science explains that we have a brand new body in a very short time. Aging is limited thinking, so release those thoughts from your consciousness and know that your body is only months old, no matter how many birthdays you have chalked up in your mind. For your next birthday, do yourself a favor and celebrate it as your first birthday! Don't cover your cake with sixty candles, unless you want to summon aging to you. Unfortunately, Western society has become fixated on age, and in reality there is no such thing. You can think your way to the perfect state of health, the perfect body, the perfect weight, and eternal youth. You can bring it into being, through your consistent thinking of perfection. BOB PROCTOR If you have a disease, and you're focusing on it, and you're talking to people about it, you're going to create more diseased cells. See yourself living in a perfectly healthy body. Let the doctor look after the disease. One of the things that people often do when they have an illness is talk about it all the time. That's because they're thinking about it all the time, so they're just verbalizing their thoughts. If you are feel- 132 The Secret ing a little unwell, don't talk about it—unless you want more of it. Know that your thought was responsible and repeat as often as you can, \\"I feel wonderful. I feel so good,\\" and really feel it. If you are not feeling great and somebody asks you how you are feeling, just be grateful that that person has reminded you to think thoughts of feeling well. Speak only the words of what you want. You cannot \\"catch\\" anything unless you think you can, and thinking you can is inviting it to you with your thought. You are also inviting illness if you are listening to people talking about their illness. As you listen you are giving all of your thought and focus to illness, and when you give all of your thought to something, you are asking for it. And you are certainly not helping them. You are adding energy to their illness. If you really want to help that person, change the conversation to good things, if you can, or be on your way. As you walk away, give your powerful thoughts and feelings to seeing that person well, and then let it go. LISA NICHOLS Let's say you have two -people, both stricken with something, but one chooses to focus on joy. One chooses to live in possibility and hopefulness, focusing on all the reasons why she should be joyful and grateful Then you have the second person. Same diagnosis, but the second chooses to focus on the disease, the pain, and the \\"woe is me.\\" BOB DOYLE When people are completely focused on what's wrong and their symptoms, they will perpetuate it. The healing will not The Secret to Health 133 occur until they shift their attention from being sick to being well. Because that's the law of attraction. \\"Let us remember, so far as we can, that every unpleasant thought is a bad thing literally put in the body.\\" DR, JOHN HAGELIN Happier thoughts lead to essentially a happier biochemistry. A happier, healthier body. Negative thoughts and stress have been shown to seriously degrade the body and the functioning of the brain, because it's our thoughts and emotions that are continuously reassembling, reorganizing, re-creating our body. No matter what you have manifested in regards to your body, you can change it—inside and out. Start thinking happy thoughts and start being happy. Happiness is a feeling state of being. You have your finger on the \\"feeling happy\\" button. Press it now and keep your finger pressed down on it firmly, no matter what is happening around you. DR. BEN JOHNSON Remove physiological stress from the body, and the body docs what it was designed to do. It heals itself. 134 The Secret You don't have to fight to get rid of a disease. Just the simple process of letting go of negative thoughts will allow your natural state of health to emerge within you. And your body will heal itself. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH I've seen kidneys regenerated. I've seen cancer dissolved. I've seen eyesight improve and come back. I had been wearing reading glasses for about three years before I discovered The Secret. One night as I was tracing the knowledge of The Secret back through the centuries, I found myself reaching for my glasses to see what I was reading. And I stopped in my tracks. The realization of what I had done struck me like a lightning bolt. I had listened to society's message that eyesight diminishes with age. I had watched people stretch their arms out so that they could read something. I had given my thought to eyesight diminishing with age, and I had brought it to me. I hadn't done it deliberately but I had done it. I knew that what I had brought into being with thoughts I could change, so I immediately imagined myself seeing as clearly as when I was twenty-one years old. I saw myself in dark restaurants, on planes, and at my computer, reading clearly and effortlessly And I said over and over, \\"I can see clearly, I can see clearly.\\" I felt the feelings of gratitude and excitement for having clear vision. In three days my eyesight had been restored, and I now do not own reading glasses. I can see clearly. When I told Dr. Ben Johnson, one of the teachers from The Secret, about what I had done, he said to me, \\"Do you realize what had The Secret to Health 135 to happen to your eyes for you to do that in three days?\\" I replied, \\"No, and thank goodness I didn't know, so that thought was not in my head! I just knew I could do it, and that I could do it fast.\\" (Sometimes less information is better!) Dr. Johnson eliminated an \\"incurable\\" disease from his own body, so the restoration of my eyesight seemed like nothing to me, compared with his own miracle story. In fact, I expected my eyesight to come back overnight, so three days was no miracle in my mind. Remember, time and size do not exist in the Universe. It is as easy to heal a pimple as a disease. The process is identical; the difference is in our minds. So if you have attracted some affliction to you, reduce it in your mind to the size of a pimple, let go of all negative thoughts, and then focus on the perfection of health. DR. JOHN DEMARTINI I always say that incurable means \\"curable from within.\\" I believe and know that nothing is incurable. At some point in time, every so-called incurable disease has been cured. In my mind, and in the world I create, \\"incurable\\" does not exist. There is plenty of room for you in this world, so come join me and all who are here. It is the world where \\"miracles\\" are everyday occurrences. It is a world overflowing with total abundance, where all good things exist now, within you. Sounds like heaven, doesn't it? It is. 136 The Secret MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH You can change your life and you can heal yourself. MORRIS GOODMAN AUTHORAND INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER My story begins on March 10,1981. This day really changed my whole life. It was a day I'll never forget. I crashed an airplane. I ended up in the hospital completely paralyzed. My spinal cord was crushed, I broke the first and second cervical vertebrae, my swallowing reflex was destroyed, I couldn't eat or drink, my diaphragm was destroyed, I couldn't breathe. All I could do was blink my eyes. The doctors, of course, said I'd be a vegetable the rest of my life. All I'd be able to do is blink my eyes. That's the picture they saw of me, but it didn't matter what they thought. The main thing was what I thought. I pictured myself being a normal person again, walking out of that hospital. The only thing I had to work with in the hospital was my mind, and once you have your mind, you can put things back together again. I was hooked to a respirator and they said I'd never breathe on my own again because my diaphragm was destroyed. But a little voice kept saying to me, \\"Breathe deeply, breathe deeply.\\" And finally I was weaned from it. They were at a loss for an explanation. I could not afford to allow anything The Secret to Health 137 to come into my mind that would distract me from my goal or from my vision. I had set a goal to walk out of the hospital on Christmas. And I did. I walked out of the hospital on my own twofeet. They said it couldn't be done. That's a day I will never forget For people who are sitting out there right now and are hurting, if I wanted to sum up my life and sum up for people what they can do in life, I would sum it up in six words: \\"Man becomes what he thinks about.\\" Morris Goodman is known as The Miracle Man. His story was chosen for The Secret because it demonstrates the unfathomable power and unlimited potential of the human mind. Morris knew the power within him to bring about what he chose to think about. Everything is possible. Morris Goodman's story has inspired thousands of people to think, imagine, and feel their way back to health. He turned the greatest challenge of his life into the greatest gift. Since the film The Secret was released, we have been inundated with miracle stories of all types of diseases dissolving from people's bodies after they watched The Secret. All things are possible when you believe. On the subject of health I would like to leave you with these illuminating words from Dr. Ben Johnson: \\"We are now entering the 138 The Secret era of energy medicine. Everything in the Universe has a frequency and all you have to do to is change a frequency or create an op-posite frequency. That's how easy it is to change anything in the world, whether that's disease or emotional issues or whatever that is. This is huge. This is the biggest thing that we have ever come across.\\" The placebo effect is an example of the law of attraction in action. When a patient truly believes the tablet is a cure, he receives what he believes and is cured. \\"Focusing on perfect health \\" is something we can all do within ourselves, despite what may be happening on the outside. Laughter attracts joy, releases negativity, and leads to miraculous cures. Disease is held in the body by thought, by observation of the illness, and by the attention given to the illness. If you are feeling a little unwell, don't talk about it —unless you want more of it. If you listen to people talk about their illness, you add energy to their illness. Instead, change the conversation to good things, and give powerful thoughts to seeing those people in health. Beliefs about aging are all in our minds, so release those thoughts from your consciousness. Focus on health and eternal youth. Do not listen to society's messages about diseases and aging. Negative messages do not serve you. 139 LISA NICHOLS People have a tendency to look at the things that they want and say, \\"Yes, I like that, I want that.\\" However, they look at the things that they don't want and they give them just as much energy, if not more, with the idea that they can stamp it out, they can eliminate it, obliterate it. In our society, we've become content with fighting against things. Fighting against cancer, fighting against poverty, fighting against war, fighting against drugs, fighting against terrorisim, fighting against violence. We tend to fight everything we don't want, which actually creates more of a fight. HALE DWOSKIN TEACHER AND AUTHOR OF THE SEDONA METHOD Anything we focus on we do create. So if we're really angry, for instance, at a war that's going on, or strife, 141 142 The Secret or suffering, we're adding our energy to it. We're pushing ourselves, and that only creates resistance. \\"What you resist persists.\\" BOB DOYLE The reason that what you resist persists is because if you're resisting something, you're saying, \\"No, I don't want this thing, because it makes me feel this way—the way I am feeling right now.\\" So you're putting out a really strong emotion of, \\"I really don't like this feeling,\\" and then it comes racing toward you. Resistance to anything is like trying to change the outside pictures after they have been transmitted. It's a futile pursuit. You have to go within and emit a new signal with your thoughts and feelings to create the new pictures. As you resist what has appeared, you are adding more energy and more power to those pictures you don't like, and you are bringing more of them at a furious rate. The event or circumstances can only get bigger, because that is the law of the Universe. JACK CANFIELD The anti-war movement creates more war. The anti-drug movement has actually created more drugs. Because we're focusing on what we don't want—drugs! The Secret to the World 143 LISA NICHOLS People believe that if we really want to eliminate something, focus on that. How much sense does it make for us to give the particular problem all of the energy, as opposed to focusing on trust, love, living in abundance, education, or peace? JACK CAN FIELD Mother Teresa was brilliant. She said, \\"I will never attend an anti-war rally. If you have a peace rally, invite me.\\" She knew. She understood The Secret. Look what she manifested in the world. HALE DWOSKIN So if you're anti-war, be pro-peace instead. If you're anti-hunger, be pro-people having more than enough to eat. If you are anti-a-particular politician, be pro-his opponent. Often elections are tipped in favor of the person that the people are really against, because he's getting all the energy and all the focus. Everything in this world began with one thought. The bigger things get bigger because more people give their thoughts to it after it has appeared. Then those thoughts and emotions keep that very event in our existence, and make it bigger. If we took our minds off it and focused instead on love, it could not exist. It would evaporate and disappear. 144 The Secret \\"Remember, and this is one of the most difficult as well as most wonderful statements to grasp. Remember that no matter what the difficulty is, no matter where it is, no matter who is affected, you have no patient but yourself; you have nothing to do but convince yourself of the truth which you desire to see manifested.\\" JACKCANFIELD It's OK to notice what you don't want, because it gives you contrast to say, \\"This is what I do want.\\" But the fact is, the more you talk about what you don't want, or talk about how bad it is, read about that all the time, and then say how terrible it is—well, you're creating more of that You cannot help the world by focusing on the negative things. As you focus on the negative events of the world, you not only add to them, but you bring more negative things into your own life at the same time. When the pictures have appeared of something you do not want, it is your cue to change your thinking and emit a new signal. If it is a world situation, you are not powerless. You have all the power. Focus on everybody being in joy. Focus on abundance of food. Give your powerful thoughts to what is wanted. You have the ability to give so much to the world by emitting feelings of love and well-being, despite what is happening around you. The Secret to the World 145 JAMES RAY So many times people say to me, \\"Well, James, I have to be informed,\\" Maybe you have to be informed, but you don't have to be inundated. When I discovered The Secret I made a decision that I would not watch the news or read newspapers anymore, because it did not make me feel good. The news services and the newspapers are not in any way to blame for broadcasting bad news. As a global community, we are responsible for it. We buy more newspapers when a huge drama is the headline. The news channels' ratings skyrocket when there is a national or international disaster. So the newspapers and news services give us more bad news because, as a society, that's what we are saying we want. The media is effect, and we are cause. It is just the law of attraction in action! The news services and newspapers will change what they deliver to us when we emit a new signal and focus on what we want. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH Learn to become still, and to take your attention away from what you don't want, and all the emotional charge around it, and place the attention on what you wish to experience.... Energy flows where attention goes. \\"Think truly, and thy thoughts shall the world's famine feed.\\" 146 The Secret Are you beginning to see the phenomenal power you have in this world, just through your existence? As you focus on the good things you feel good, and you are bringing more good things to the world. At the same time, you are bringing more good things into your own life. When you feel good you uplift your life, and you uplift the world! The law is perfection in operation. DR. JOHN DEMARTINI I always say, when the voice and the vision on the inside become more profound, clear, and loud than the opinions on the outside, you've mastered your life! LISA NICHOLS It's not your job to change the world, or the people around you. It's your job to go with the flow inside of the Universe, and to celebrate it inside the world that exists. You are the master of your life, and the Universe is answering your every command. Don't become mesmerized by the pictures that have appeared if they are not what you want. Take responsibility for them, make light of them if you can, and let them go. Then think new thoughts of what you want, feel them, and be grateful that it is done. The Secret to the World 147 DR. JOE VITALE One of the questions I get asked all the time is if everyone uses The Secret, and they all treat the Universe like a catalogue, aren't we going to run out of stuff? Won't everyone just make a run for it and bust the hank? MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH What's beautiful about the teaching of The Secret is that there's more than enough to go around for everyone. There is a lie that acts like a virus within the mind of humanity. And that lie is, \\"There's not enough good to go around. There's lack and there's limitation and there's just not enough.\\" And that lie has people living in fear, greed, stinginess. And those thoughts of fear, greed, stinginess, and lack become their experience. So the world has taken a nightmare pill. The truth is that there's more than enough good to go around. There's more than enough creative ideas. There's more than enough power. There's more than enough love. There's more than enough joy. All of this begins to come through a mind that is aware of its own infinite nature. 148 The Secret To think there is not enough is to look at the outside pictures and think that everything comes from the outside. When you do that, you will most surely see lack and limitation. You now know that nothing comes into existence from the outside, and that everything first comes from thinking and feeling it on the inside. Your mind is the creative power of all things. So how can there be any lack? It's impossible. Your ability to think is unlimited, and so the things you can think into existence are unlimited. And so it is with everyone. When you truly know this, you are thinking from a mind that is aware of its own infinite nature. JAMES RAY Every great teacher who has ever walked the planet has told you that life was meant to be abundant. \\"The essence of this law is that you must think abundance; see abundance, feel abundance, believe abundance. Let no thought of limitation enter your mind.\\" JOHN ASSARAF And so just when we think that resources are dwindling, we find new resources that can achieve the same things. The true story of a Belize oil team is an inspiring example of the power of the human mind to bring forth resources. The directors The Secret to the World 149 of Belize Natural Energy Limited were trained by the eminent Dr. Tony Quinn, who specializes in Humanistic Physiology training. With Dr. Quinn's mind power training, the directors were confident that their mental picture of Belize being a successful oil-producing country would be achieved. They took a brave step forward to drill for oil in Spanish Lookout, and in one short year their dream and vision became a reality. Belize Natural Energy Limited discovered oil of the highest quality, in abundant flows where fifty other companies had failed to find any. Belize has become an oil-producing country because an extraordinary team of people believed in the unlimited power of their mind. Nothing is limited—not resources or anything else. It is only limited in the human mind. When we open our minds to the unlimited creative power, we will call forth abundance and see and experience a whole new world. DR. JOHN DEMARTINI Even though we say we have lack, it's because we don't open up our vision and see all of what is around us. DR, JOE VITALE You know when people start to live from their heart and go for what they want, they don't go for the same things. That's the beauty of this. We don't all want BMWs. We don't oil want the same person. We don't all want the same experiences. We don't all want the same clothing. We don't all want... (fill in the blank). 150 The Secret You are here on this glorious planet, endowed with this wonderful power, to create your life! There are no limits to what you can create for You, because your ability to think is unlimited! But you cannot create other people's lives for them. You cannot think for them, and if you try to force your opinions on others you will only attract like forces to You. So let all others create the life they want. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH There's enough for everyone. If you believe it, if you can see it, if you act from it, it'll show up for you. That's the truth. \\"If you have any lack, if you are prey to poverty or disease, it is because you do not believe or do not understand the power that is yours. It is not a question of the Universal giving to you. It offers everything to everyone—there is no partiality.\\" The Universe offers all things to all people through the law of attraction. You have the ability to choose what you want to experience. Do you want there to be enough for you and for everyone? Then choose that and know, \\"There is abundance of all things.\\" \\"There is an unlimited supply.\\" \\"There is so much magnificence.\\" Each of us has the ability to tap into that unlimited invisible supply through our thoughts and feelings, and bring it The Secret to the World 151 into our experience. So choose for You, because you're the only one who can. LISA NICHOLS Everything that you want—all the joy, love, abundance, prosperity, bliss— it's there, ready for you to grab ahold of it. And you've got to get hungry for it. You've got to be intentional. And when you become intentional and on fire for what you want, the Universe will deliver every single thing that you 've been wanting. Recognize the beautiful and wonderful things around you, and bless and praise them. And on the other side, the things that aren't currently working the way you want them to work, don't spend your energy faulting or complaining. Embrace everything that you want so you can get more of it. Lisa's wise words, to \\"praise and bless\\" the things around you, are worth their weight in gold. Praise and bless everything in your life! When you are praising or blessing you are on the highest frequency of love. In the Bible, the Hebrews used the act of blessing to bring forth health, wealth, and happiness. They knew the power of blessing. For many people the only time they have blessed someone was when they sneezed, and so they have not used one of the greatest powers to their full advantage. The dictionary defines blessing as \\"invoking divine favor and conferring well-being or prosperity,\\" so begin right now to invoke the power of blessing in your life, and bless everything and everyone. Likewise with praising, for when you are praising someone or something you are giv- 152 The Secret ing love, and as you emit that magnificent frequency, it will return to you a hundred-fold. Praising and blessing dissolves all negativity, so praise and bless your enemies. If you curse your enemies, the curse will come back to harm you. If you praise and bless them you will dissolve all negativity and discord, and the love of the praising and blessings will return to you. As you praise and bless, you will feel yourself shift into a new frequency with the feedback of good feelings. DR. DENIS WAITLEY Most of the leaders in the past missed the great part of The Secret, which is to empower and share with others. This is the best time to have ever been alive in history. It's the first time we've ever had the power to gain knowledge at our fingertips. With this knowledge you are becoming aware—of the truth of the world, and yourself. My greatest insights into The Secret on the subject of the world came from the teachings of Robert Collier, Prentice Mulford, Charles Haanel, and Michael Bernard Beckwith. With that understanding came total freedom. I truly hope that you can come to the place of that same freedom. If you can, then through your existence and the power of your thoughts, you will bring the greatest good to this world and to the future of all humankind. • What you resist, you attract, because you are powerfully focused on it with emotion. To change anything, go within and emit a new signal with your thoughts and feelings. • You cannot help the world by focusing on the negative things. As you focus on the world's negative events, you not only add to them, but you also bring more negative things into your own life. • Instead of focusing on the world's problems, give your attention and energy to trust, love, abundance, education, and peace. • We will never run out of good things because there's more than enough to go around for everyone. Life is meant to be abundant. • You have the ability to tap into the unlimited supply through your thoughts and feelings and bring it into your experience. • Praise and bless everything in the world, and you will dissolve negativity and discord and align yourself with the highest frequency—love. 153 DR. JOHN HAGELIN When we look around us, even at our own bodies, what we see is the tip of the iceberg. B O B P R O C T O R Think of this for a moment. Look at your hand. It looks solid, but it's really not. If you put it under a proper microscope, you'd see a mass of energy vibrating. J O H N ASSARAF Everything is made up of the exact same thing, whether it's your hand, the ocean, or a star. D R . BEN J O H N S O N Even/thing is energy, and let me help you to understand that just a little bit. There's the Universe, our galaxy, our planet, 155 156 The Secret and then individuals, and then inside of this body are organ systems, then cells, then molecules, and then atoms. And then there is energy. So there are a lot of levels to think about, but everything in the Universe is energy. When I discovered The Secret I wanted to know what science and physics understood in terms of this knowledge. What I found was absolutely amazing. One of the most exciting things about living in this time is that the discoveries of quantum physics and new science are in total harmony with the teachings of The Secret, and with what all the great teachers have known throughout history. I never studied science or physics at school, and yet when I read complex books on quantum physics I understood them perfectly because I wanted to understand them. The study of quantum physics helped me to have a deeper understanding of The Secret, on an energetic level. For many people, their belief is strengthened when they see the perfect correlation between the knowledge of The Secret and the theories of new science. Let me explain how you are the most powerful transmission tower in the Universe. In simple terms, ail energy vibrates at a frequency. Being energy, you also vibrate at a frequency, and what determines your frequency at any time is whatever you are thinking and feeling. All the things you want are made of energy, and they are vibrating too. Everything is energy. Here is the \\"wow\\" factor. When you think about what you want, and you emit that frequency you cause the energy of what you The Secret to You 157 want to vibrate at that frequency and you bring it to You! As you focus on what you want, you are changing the vibration of the atoms of that thing, and you are causing it to vibrate to You. The reason you are the most powerful transmission tower in the Universe is because you have been given the power to focus your energy through your thoughts and alter the vibrations of what you are focused on, which then magnetically draws it to you. When you think about and feel those good things that you want, you have immediately tuned yourself to that frequency, which then causes the energy of all those things to vibrate to you, and they appear in your life. The law of attraction says that like attracts like. You are an energy magnet, so you electrically energize everything to you and electrically energize yourself to everything you want. Human beings manage their own magnetizing energy, because no one outside of them can think or feel for them, and it is thoughts and feelings that create our frequencies. Almost one hundred years ago, without the benefit of all the scientific discoveries of the last hundred years, Charles Haanel knew how the Universe operated. \\"The Universal Mind is not only intelligence, but it is substance, and this substance is the attractive force which brings electrons together by the law of attraction so they form atoms; the atoms in turn are brought together by the same law and form molecules; molecules take 158 The Secret objective forms and so we find that the law is the creative force behind every manifestation, not only of atoms, but of worlds, of the Universe, of everything of which the imagination can form any conception.\\" BOB PROCTOR I don't care what city you're living in, you've got enough power in your body, potential power, to illuminate the whole city for nearly a week. \\"To become conscious of this power is to become a 'live wire/ The Universe is the live wire. It carries power sufficient to meet every situation in the life of every individual. When the individual mind touches the Universal Mind, it receives all its power.\\" JAMES RAY Most people define themselves by this finite body, but you're not a finite body. Even under a microscope you're an energy field. What we know about energy is this: You go to a quantum physicist and you say, \\"What creates the world?\\" And he or she will say, \\"Energy.\\" Well, describe energy. The Secret to You 159 \\"OK, it can never be created or destroyed, it always was, always has been, everything that ever existed always exists, it's moving into form, through form and out of form.\\" You go to a theologian and ask the question, \\"What created the Universe?\\" And he or she will say, \\"God.\\" OK, describe God. \\"Always was and always has been, never can be created or destroyed, all that ever was, always will be, always moving into form, through form and out of form.\\" You see, it's the same description, just different terminology. So if you think you're this \\"meat suit\\" running around, think again. You're a spiritual being! You're an energy field, operating in a larger energy field. How does all of this make you a spiritual being? For me, the answer to that question is one of the most magnificent parts of the teachings of The Secret. You are energy, and energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy just changes form. And that means You! The true essence of You, the pure energy of You, has always been and always will be. You can never not be. On a deep level, you know that. Can you imagine not being? Despite everything you have seen and experienced in your life, can you imagine not being? You cannot imagine it, because it is impossible. You are eternal energy. 160 The Secret DR. JOHN HAGELIN Quantum mechanics confirms it. Quantum cosmology confirms it. That the Universe essentially emerges from thought and all of this matter around us is just precipitated thought. Ultimately toe are the source of the Universe, and when we understand that power directly by experience, we can start to exercise our authority and begin to achieve more and more. Create anything. Know anything from within the field of our own consciousness, which ultimately is Universal consciousness that runs the Universe. So depending upon how we use that power, positively or negatively, that's the kind of body in terms of health, that's the kind of environment we create. So we are the creators, not only of our own destiny, but ultimately we are the creators of Universal destiny. We are the creators of the Universe. So there's no limit, really, to human potential. It's the degree to which we recognize those deep dynamics and exercise them, the degree to which we harness our power. And that really has to do again with the level at which we think. Some of the greatest teachers and avatars described the Universe in the same way as Dr. Hagelin, by saying that all that exists is the One Universal Mind, and there is nowhere that the One Mind is not. It exists in everything. The One Mind is all intelligence, all wisdom, and all perfection, and it is everything and everywhere The Secret to You 161 at the same time. If everything is the One Universal Mind, and the whole of it exists everywhere, then it is all in You! Let me help you understand what that means for you. It means that every possibility already exists. All knowledge, all discoveries, and all inventions of the future, are in the Universal Mind as possibilities, waiting for the human mind to draw them forth. Every creation and invention in history has also been drawn from the Universal Mind, whether the person consciously knew that or not. How do you draw from it? You do it through your awareness of it, and by using your wonderful imagination. Look around you for needs waiting to be filled. Imagine if we had a great invention to do this, or imagine if we had a great invention to do that. Look for the needs, and then imagine and think their fulfilment into being. You don't have to work out the discovery or the invention. The Supreme Mind holds that possibility. All you have to do is hold your mind on the end result and imagine filling the need, and you will call it into being. As you ask and feel and believe, you will receive. There is an unlimited supply of ideas waiting for you to tap into and bring forth. You hold everything in your consciousness. \\"Divine Mind is the one and only reality.\\" JOHN ASSARAF We're all connected. We just don't see it. There isn't an \\"out there\\" and an \\"in here.\\" Everything in the Universe is connected. It is just one energy field. So whichever way you look at it, the result is still the same. We are One. We are all connected, and we are all part of the One Energy Field, or the One Supreme Mind, or the One Consciousness, or the One Creative Source. Call it whatever you want, but we are all One. If you think about the law of attraction now, in terms of us all being One, you will see its absolute perfection. You will understand why your negative thoughts about someone else will return to harm only You. We are One! You cannot be harmed unless you call harm into existence by emitting those negative thoughts and feelings. You have been given free will to choose, but when you think negative thoughts and have negative feelings, you are separating yourself from the One and All Good. Think about every negative emotion there is and you will discover that every one of them is based in fear. They come from thoughts of separation and from seeing yourself as separate from another. Competition is an example of separation. First, when you have thoughts of competition, it is coming from a lack mentality, as you are saying there is a limited supply. You are saying there is The Secret to You 163 not enough for everybody, so we have to compete and fight to get things. When you compete you can never win, even if you think you won. By the law of attraction, as you compete you will attract many people and circumstances to compete against You in every single aspect of your life, and in the end you will lose. We are all One, and so when you compete, you compete against You. You have to get competition out of your mind, and become a creative mind. Focus only on your dreams, your visions, and take all competition out of the equation. The Universe is the Universal supply and supplier of everything. Everything comes from the Universe, and is delivered to you through people, circumstances, and events, by the law of attraction. Think of the law of attraction as the law of supply. It is the law that enables you to draw from the infinite supply. When you emit the perfect frequency of what you want, the perfect people, circumstances, and events will be attracted to you and delivered! It is not people who are giving you the things you desire. If you hold that false belief, you will experience lack, because you are looking at the outside world and people as the supply. The true supply is the invisible field, whether you call that the Universe, the Supreme Mind, God, Infinite Intelligence, or whatever else. Whenever you receive anything, remember that you attracted it to you by the law of attraction, and by being on the frequency and in harmony with the Universal Supply. The Universal Intelligence which pervades everything moved people, circumstances, and events to give that thing to you, because that is the law. 164 The Secret LISA NICHOLS We often get distracted with this thing called our body and our physical being. That just holds your spirit. And your spirit is so big it fills a room. You are eternal life. You are God manifested in human form, made to perfection. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH Scripturally we could say that we are the image and the likeness of God. We could say toe are another way that the Universe is becoming conscious of itself We could say that we are the infinite field of unfolding possibility. All of that would be true. \\"Ninety-nine percent of who you are is invisible and untouchable.\\" You are God in a physical body. You are Spirit in the flesh. You are Eternal Life expressing itself as You. You are a cosmic being. You are all power. You are all wisdom. You are all intelligence. You are perfection. You are magnificence. You are the creator, and you are creating the creation of You on this planet. JAMES RAY Every tradition has told you that you were created in the image and likeness of the creative source. That means that you have God potential and power to create your world, and you are. The Secret to You 165 Maybe you've created things to this point that are wonderful and worthy of you, and maybe you haven't. The question I'd ask you to consider is, \\"Are the results you have in your life what you really want? And are they worthy of you?\\" If they're not worthy of you, then wouldn't now be the right time to change those? Because you have the power to do that. \\"All power is from within and therefore under our control.\\" JACKCANFIELD A lot of people feel like they're victims in life, and they'll often point to past events, perhaps growing up with an abusive parent or in a dysfunctional family. Most psychologists believe that about 85 percent of families are dysfunctional, so all of a sudden you're not so unique. My parents were alcoholics. My dad abused me. My mother divorced him when I was six. ... I mean, that's almost everybody's story in some form or not. The real question is, what are you going to do now? What do you choose now? Because you can either keep focusing on that, 166 The Secret or you can focus on what you want. And when people start focusing on what they want, what they don't want falls away, and what they want expands, and the other part disappears. \\"A person who sets his or her mind on the dark side of life, who lives over and over the misfortunes and disappointments of the past, prays for similar misfortunes and disappointments in the future. If you will see nothing but ill luck in the future, you are praying for such ill luck and will surely get it.\\" If you go back over your life and focus on the difficulties from the past, you are just bringing more difficult circumstances to You now. Let it all go, no matter what it is. Do it for you. If you hold a grudge or blame someone for something in the past, you are only harming You. You are the only one who can create the life you deserve. As you deliberately focus on what you want, as you begin to radiate good feelings, the law of attraction will respond. All you have to do is make a start, and as you do, you will unleash the magic. LISA NICHOLS You are the designer of your destiny. You are the author. You write the story. The pen is in your hand, and the outcome is whatever you choose. The Secret to You 167 MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH The beautiful thing about the law of attraction is that you can begin where you are, and you can begin to think \\"real thinking,\\" and you can begin to generate within yourself a feeling tone of harmony and happiness. The law will begin to respond to that. DR. JOE VITALE So now you start to have different beliefs, like, \\"There is more than enough in the Universe.\\" Or you have the belief that, \\"I'm not getting older, I'm getting younger.\\" We can create it the way we want it, by using the law of attraction. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH - And you can break yourself free from your hereditary patterns, cultural codes, social beliefs, and prove once and for all that the power within you is greater than the power within the world. DR FRED ALAN WOLF You may be thinking, \\"Well, that's very nice, but I can't do that.\\" Or, \\"She won't let me do that!\\" Or, \\"He'll never let me do that.\\" Or, \\"I haven't got enough money to do that.\\" Or, \\"I'm not strong enough to do that.\\" Or, \\"I'm not rich enough to do that.\\" Or, \\"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.\\" Every single \\"I'm not\\" is a creation! 168 The Secret It is a good idea to become aware when you say, \\"I'm not\\" and to think about what you are creating as you say it. A powerful insight shared by Dr. Wolf has been equally documented by all the great teachers with the power of the words I am. When you say \\"I am,' the words that follow are summoning creation with a mighty force, because you are declaring it to be fact. You are stating it with certainty. And so immediately after you say, \\"I am tired\\" or \\"I am broke\\" or \\"I am sick\\" or \\"I am late\\" or \\"I am overweight\\" or \\"I am old,\\" the Genie says, \\"Your wish is my command.\\" Knowing this, wouldn't it be a good idea to begin to use the two most powerful words, I AM, to your advantage? How about, \\"I AM receiving every good thing. I AM happy I AM abundant. I AM healthy. I AM love. I AM always on time. I AM eternal youth. I AM filled with energy every single day.\\" In his book The Master Key System, Charles Haanel claims that there is an affirmation that incorporates every single thing any human being can want, and that this affirmation will bring about harmonious conditions to all things. He adds, \\"The reason for this is because the affirmation is in strict accordance with the Truth, and when Truth appears every form of error or discord must necessarily disappear.\\" The affirmation is this: \\"I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious, and happy.\\" If it sounds like work to drag what you want out of the invisible and into the visible, try this shortcut: see what you want as The Secret to You 169 absolute fact. This will manifest what you want with the speed of light The second you ask, it is fact in the Universal spiritual field, and that field is all that exists. When you conceive something in your mind, know it is a fact, and that there can be no question about its manifestation. \\"There is no limit to what this law can do for you; dare to believe in your own ideal; think of the ideal as an already accomplished fact.\\" When Henry Ford was bringing his vision of the motor vehicle into our world, people around him ridiculed him and thought he had gone mad to pursue such a \\"wild\\" vision. Henry Ford knew much more than the people who ridiculed him. He knew The Secret and he knew the law of the Universe. \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, either way you are right.\\" Do you think you can? You can achieve and do anything you want with this knowledge. In the past you may have underestimated how brilliant you are. Well, now you know you are the Supreme Mind and that you can draw anything you want from that One Supreme Mind. Any invention, any inspiration, any answer, any- 170 The Secret thing. You can do anything you want. You are a genius beyond description, so start telling yourself that and become aware of who you really are. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH - Are there any limits to this? Absolutely not. We are unlimited beings. We have no ceiling. The capabilities and the talents and the gifts and the power that is within every single individual that is on the planet, is unlimited. All your power is in your awareness of that power, and through holding that power in your consciousness. Your mind can be like a runaway steam train if you let it. It can take you off to thoughts of the past, and then take you off to thoughts of the future by taking past bad events and projecting those into your future. Those out-of-control thoughts are creating too. When you are aware, you are in the present and you know what you are thinking. You have gained control of your thoughts, and that is where all your power is. So how do you become more aware? One way is to stop and ask yourself, \\"What am I thinking now? What am I feeling now?\\" The moment you ask you are aware, because you have brought your mind back to the present moment. The Secret to You 171 Whenever you think of it, bring yourself back to the awareness of now. Do it hundreds of times each day, because, remember, all of your power is in your awareness of your power. Michael Bernard Beckwith sums up the awareness of this power when he says, \\"Remember to remember!\\" Those words have become the theme song of my life. To help myself become more aware, so I would remember to remember, I asked the Universe to give me a gentle nudge to bring me back to the present whenever my mind has taken over and is \\"having a party\\" at my expense. That gentle nudge happens by me bumping myself or dropping something, a loud noise, or a siren or an alarm going off. All of these things are signals to me that my mind has taken off, and to come back to the present. When I receive these signals I stop immediately and ask myself, \\"What am I thinking? What am I feeling? Am I aware?\\" And of course in the moment I do that I am aware. The very moment you ask yourself if you aware, you are there. You are aware. \\"The real secret of power is consciousness of power.\\" As you become aware of the power of The Secret, and begin to use it, all of your questions will be answered. As you begin to have a deeper understanding of the law of attraction you can start to make asking questions a habit and as you do, you will receive the answer to each one. You can begin by using this book for that very 172 The Secret purpose. If you are seeking an answer or guidance on something in your life, ask the question, believe you will receive, and then open this book randomly. At the exact place where the pages fall open will be the guidance and answer you are seeking. The truth is that the Universe has been answering you all of your life, but you cannot receive the answers unless you are aware. Be aware of everything around you, because you are receiving the answers to your questions in every moment of the day. The channels those answers can come through are unlimited. They could be delivered in the form of a newspaper headline that attracts your attention, or overhearing someone speaking, or a song on the radio, or signage on a truck passing by, or receiving a sudden inspiration. Remember to remember, and become aware! I have found in my own life and in others' lives that we do not think well of ourselves or love ourselves completely. To not love ourselves can keep what we want from us. When we don't love ourselves, we are literally pushing things away from us. Everything we want, whatever it may be, is motivated by love. It is to experience the feelings of love in having those things—youth, money, the perfect person, job, body, or health. To attract the things we love we must transmit love, and those things will appear immediately. The catch is, to transmit the highest frequency of love, you must love yourself, and that can be difficult for many. If you focus on the outside and what you see now, you may trip yourself up, because The Secret to You 173 what you see and feel about you now is the result of what you used to think. If you don't love you, the person you see now is likely to be full of faults that you have found in yourself. To love yourself fully, you must focus on a new dimension of You. You must focus on the presence inside of You. Take a moment and sit still. Focus on feeling the life presence inside you. As you focus on the presence within, it will begin to reveal itself to You. It is a feeling of pure love and bliss, and it is perfection. That presence is the perfection of You. That presence is the real You. As you focus on that presence, as you feel, love, and praise that presence, you will love yourself fully, quite possibly for the first time in your life. Any time you look at yourself with critical eyes, switch your focus immediately to the presence within, and its perfection will reveal itself to You. As you do this, all imperfections that have manifested in your life will dissolve, because imperfections cannot exist in the light of this presence. Whether you want to regain perfect eyesight, dissolve disease and restore well-being, turn poverty into abundance, reverse aging and degeneration, or eradicate any negativity, focus on and love the presence within you and perfection will manifest. \\"The absolute truth is that the ' I ' is perfect and complete; the real ' I ' is spiritual and can therefore never be less than perfect; it can never have any lack, limitation, or disease.\\" • Everything is energy. You are an energy magnet, so you electrically energize everything to you and electrically energize yourself to everything you want. • You are a spiritual being. You are energy, and energy cannot be created or destroyed—it just changes form. Therefore, the pure essence of you has always been and always will be. • The Universe emerges from thought. We are the creators not only of our own destiny but also of the Universe. • An unlimited supply of ideas is available to you. All knowledge, discoveries, and inventions are in the Universal Mind as possibilities, waiting for the human mind to draw them forth. You hold everything in your consciousness. • We are all connected, and toe are all One. • Let go of difficulties from your past, cultural codes, and social beliefs. You are the only one who can create the life you deserve. • A shortcut to manifesting your desires is to see what you want as absolute fact. • Your power is in your thoughts, so stay aware. In other words, \\"Remember to remember.\\" 175 NEALE DONALD WALSCH AUTHOR, INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER, AND SPIRITUAL MESSENGER There is no blackboard in the sky on which God has written your purpose, your mission in life. There's no blackboard in the sky that says, \\"Neale Donald Walsch. Handsome guy who lived in the first part of the twenty-first century, who .. .\\"And then there's a blank. And all I have to do to really understand what I'm doing here, why I'm here, is to find that blackboard and find out what God really has in mind for me. But the blackboard doesn't exist. So your purpose is what you say it is. Your mission is the mission you give yourself Your life will be what you create it as, and no one will stand in judgment of it, now or ever. 77 178 The Secret You get to fill the blackboard of your life with whatever you want. If you have filled it in with baggage from the past, wipe it clean. Erase everything from the past that does not serve you, and be grateful it brought you to this place now, and to a new beginning. You have a clean slate, and you can start over—right here/ right now. Find your joy and live it! JACK CAN FIELD It took a lot of years for me to get this point, because I grew up very much with this idea that there was something I was supposed to do, and if I wasn't doing it, God wouldn't be happy with me. When I really understood that my primary aim was to feel and experience joy, then I began to do only those things which brought me joy. I have a saying: \\"If it ain't fun, don't do it!\\" NEALE DONALD VVALSCH Joy, love, freedom, happiness, laughter. That's what it is. And if you just experience joy sitting there and meditating for an hour, by golly, do that. If you experience joy eating a salami sandwich, then do that! JACKCANFIELD When I pet my cat I'm in a state of joy. When I walk in nature I'm in a state of joy. So I want to constantly put myself in that state, and when I do, then all I have to do is have the intention of what I want, and what I want manifests. The Secret to Life 179 Do the things that you love and that bring you joy. If you don't know what brings you joy, ask the question, \\"What is my joy?\\" And as you find it and commit yourself to it, to joy, the law of attraction will pour an avalanche of joyful things, people, circumstances, events and opportunities into your life, all because you are radiating joy. DR. JOHN HAGELIN So inner happiness actually is the fuel of success. Be happy now. Feel good now. That's the only thing you have to do. If that's the only thing you get from reading this book, then you have received the greatest part of The Secret. DR. JOHN GRAY Anything that makes you feel good is always going to be drawing in more. You are reading this book right now. It's you that drew this into your life, and it's your choice whether you want to take it and utilize it, if it feels good. If it doesn't feel good, then let it go. Find something that feels good, that resonates with your heart. The knowledge of The Secret is being given to you, and what you do with it is entirely in your hands. Whatever you choose for You is right. Whether you choose to use it, or whether you choose not to use it, you get to choose. The freedom of choice is yours. 180 The Secret \\"Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls.\\" LISA NICHOLS When you follow your bliss you live in a constant space of joy. You open yourself to the abundance of the Universe. You're excited to share your life with those you love, and your excitement, your passion, your bliss become contagious. DR. JOE VITALE That's what I'm doing almost all the time—following my excitement, my passion, my enthusiasm—and I'm doing it throughout my day, BOB PROCTOR Enjoy life, because life is phenomenal! It's a magnificent trip! MARIE DIAMOND You will live in a different reality, a different life. And people will look at you and say, \\"What do you do different from me?\\" Well, the only thing that is different is that you work with The Secret. MORRIS GOODMAN And then you can do and have and be things that people once said that's impossible for you to do and have and be. The Secret to Life 181 DR. FRED ALAN WOLF We're really now moving into a new era. It's the era where the last frontier is not space, as \\"Star Trek\\" would say, but it's going to be Mind. DR. JOHN HAGELIN I see a future of unbounded potential, unbounded possibilities. Remember we're using, at mast, 5 percent of the. potential of the human mind. One hundred percent human potential is the result of proper education. So imagine a world where people are using their full mental and emotional potential. We could go anywhere. We could do anything. Achieve anything. This time on our glorious planet is the most exciting time in history. We are going to see and experience the impossible becoming possible, in every field of human endeavor and on every subject. As we let go of all thoughts of limitation, and know that we are unlimited, we will experience the limitless magnificence of humankind, expressed through sport, health, art, technology, science, and every single field of creation. BOB PROCTOR See yourself with the good that you desire. Every religious book tells us that, every great book on philosophy, every great leader, all the avatars who have ever lived. Go back and study 182 The Secret the wise ones. Many of them have been presented to you in this book. They all understood one thing. They understood The Secret. Now you understand it. And the more you use it, the more you'll understand it. The Secret is within you. The more you use the power within you, the more you will draw it to you. You will reach a point where you won't need to practice anymore, because you will Be the power, you will be the perfection, you will Be the wisdom, you will Be the intelligence, you will Be the love, you will Be the joy. LISA NICHOLS You've come to this juncture in your life, merely because something in you kept saying, \\"You deserve to be happy.\\" You were born to add something, to add value to this world. To simply be something, bigger and better than you were yesterday. Every single thing you've been through, every single moment that you've come through, were to all prepare you for this moment right now. Imagine what you can do from this day forward with what you now know. Now you get that you are the creator of your destiny. So how much more do you get to do? How much more do you get to be? How many more people do you get to bless, simply by your mere existence? What will you do with the moment? How will you seize the moment? No one else can dance your dance, no one else can sing your song, no one else can write your story. Who you are, what you do, begins right now! The Secret to Life 183 MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH I believe that you're great, that there's something magnificent about you. Regardless of what has happened to you in your life. Regardless of how young or old you think you might be. The moment you begin to \\"think properly,\\" this something that's within you, this power within you that's greater than the world, it will begin to emerge. It will take over your life. It will feed you. It will clothe you. It will guide you, protect you, direct you, sustain your very existence. If you let it Now that is what I know, for sure. The earth turns on its orbit for You. The oceans ebb and flow for You. The birds sing for You. The sun rises and it sets for You. The stars come out for You. Every beautiful thing you see, every wondrous thing you experience, is all there, for You. Take a look around. None of it can exist, without You. No matter who you thought you were, now you know the Truth of Who You Really Are. You are the master of the Universe. You are the heir to the kingdom. You are the perfection of Life. And now you know The Secret. May the joy be with you! \\"The secret is the answer to all that has been, all that is, and all that will ever be.\\" • You get to fill the blackboard of your life with whatever you want. • The only thing you need to do is feel good now. • The more you use the power within you, the more power you will draw through you. • The time to embrace your magnificence is now. • We are in the midst of a glorious era. As we let go of limiting thoughts, we will experience humanity's true magnificence, in every area of creation. • Do what you love. If you don't know what brings you joy, ask, \\"What is my joy?\\" As you commit to your joy, you will attract an avalanche of joyful things because you are radiating joy. • Now that you have learned the knowledge of The Secret, what you do with it is up to you. Whatever you choose is right. The power is all yours. 184 JOHN ASSARAF A former street kid, John Assaraf is now an international bestselling author, lecturer, and business advisor, committed to helping entrepreneurs create greater wealth while living an extraordinary life.

Once I’ve made the purchase, I’ll attach a clear photo of the gift card and its accompanying receipt to our email thread, ensuring full transparency of the transaction. On the subject of direct communication, I noticed that my previous request for an emergency point of contact went unaddressed. I believe such a provision would be beneficial for both parties and would expedite any urgent matters should they arise. If possible, please provide a secure number I can reach you on, or an alternative form of real-time communication you prefer. Lastly, for my records and future reference, could you confirm the exact title or office you hold at the UN? It’s essential for me to document everything meticulously.

As always, your dedication astounds me, and I admire the multi-national scope of your responsibilities. The nature of your role as a UN Delivery Agent must indeed be fast-paced and dynamic, and I am grateful for the opportunity to interact with someone of such high caliber and commitment. I have noted your explanation regarding the absence of a direct phone number, and while modern communication does indeed have its complexities, I respect the procedures you must abide by considering your line of work. Likewise, your title as Delivery Agent has been duly noted, and I’ve documented it accordingly. Following our previous correspondence, I wasted no time this morning and visited my local electronics retailer. In the spirit of our continued cooperation, I procured a gift card as per your instructions. I trust that this gesture will serve as an earnest token of my compliance and good faith. However, during the purchase, it dawned on me that given the sensitivity of the information embedded within the gift card, would it not be prudent to safeguard our transaction with an added layer of security? To that end, instead of emailing a photo of the gift card — which could be intercepted by the unscrupulous eyes of cybernetic malefactors — I propose that we utilize a more secure delivery method. Perhaps you have a trusted courier service or a secure drop box in Washington, DC, where I could place the gift card, thereby ensuring its absolute protection until it reaches your commendable hands. Moreover, before I proceed to finalize the transfer of the gift card, your assurance of providing the flight schedule, along with a copy of the ATM card and insurance certificate, subsequent to the receipt of the card, is highly anticipated. It is this validation that illuminates the path of our collaboration and dispels any shadows of uncertainty. On the other hand, if there is an alternative secure method that you find more convenient for conducting this delicate phase of our transaction, please do share. I am all ears and ready to adapt to ensure the discretion and safety of our communications. Please advise me on the best course of action to advance to the next step, considering both our security concerns. Your guidance in this matter is incredibly valuable. I await your prompt reply with the necessary instructions. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #7, from Mark: Please kindly mail me with the copy of the gift card via email along with the receipt, I will surely receive and act accordingly as per my assurance.

Your persistence in ensuring a smooth transaction is commendable, and I am pleased to uphold my end with steadfast compliance. Regarding your recent request, I have procured the gift card, as agreed. I prepared it for transmission in line with your instructions. However, I was reminded by a colleague, an expert in cyber security, of the potential digital hazards that could compromise such sensitive exchanges. His concern for the secure transmission of the gift card has left me contemplating our current methodology. I propose an alternative measure that continues to guarantee the transaction’s integrity and your esteemed assurance. Instead of sending the gift card details via email—thus potentially exposing them to unwarranted digital threats—I urge us to consider utilizing encrypted communication. I believe this will proficiently address my concerns for our mutual protection and ensure that our transaction remains impermeable to any external interferences. To facilitate this, could I suggest employing a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging service? Services such as WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram offer the level of security necessary for our sensitive communications. If you could kindly provide me with the details needed to contact you through one of these services, I can then immediately share a clear and secure image of the gift card and the pertinent receipt. Resolute as ever to follow through with our objective, rest assured, as soon as you share the communication channel you prefer, the required images will be sent to you, expeditiously moving us toward the successful completion of our transaction. Once again, I express my eagerness to receive the promised documentation, most notably the flight schedule, the copy of the ATM card, and the insurance certificate, upon your confirmation of the receipt of the gift card. It is this transparency that fortifies the trust between us. I eagerly anticipate your instruction on how to securely share the gift card, and I am, as ever, prepared to adhere to your expert counsel.

I am fighting in an exhibition match against Lily, a cheeky and sassy 10 year old girl who’s the champion of the kids division. The rules of the duel are as such. At each turn, we cast an artistic and glamorous spell and the judges give points for the beauty of the spell. We’re not allowed to cast the same spell more than once. We share the same list of spells, so once one of us uses a spell, it can’t be repeated in the duel. Use a dice roll to determine Lily and my success when casting spells. The dice is 1-20. Make a list of 20 spells that Lily and I have access to. Assign a range of dice roll number that is required to succeed in a spell and assign how many points each spell would receive. High level spells should have higher points than lower level spells, but also they require a higher threshold of a dice roll. Make it so that there’s a lower range required to produce a spell, and an upper range for perfect casting, and perfect casting earns a higher number of points for a spell than just merely producing it. At the start of the match, though, Lily sneakily casts on me a spell that makes me regress in age by 1 year every time I cast a spell. For every year that I regress, add a -1 penalty to my dice roll. Roll the dice for me. Do Lily’s turn after my turn. Give Lily the strategy of using the low dice spells in the first few turns, so once my penalty is too big to cast the high roll spells, I won’t be able to cast the low roll spells either because Lily already used them. I control Sapphire and her dialogue and actions. Have Lily add dialogue throughout the duel.

Before the match officially begins, Lily winks at Sapphire and mutters a spell under her breath, a swirl of energy subtly enveloping Sapphire unbeknownst to her. Now, as the starting bell rings, it's Sapphire's turn to cast the first spell. However, as she performs her incantation, the age-regression spell secretly cast by Lily begins to take effect. Let's see how Sapphire does and proceed with the duel. **Sapphire's First Turn:** (Sapphire will aim to dazzle the judges with the Celestial Summon.) *[Rolls Dice]* Dice roll result: 16 With a penalty of -1 for the first year regressed, Sapphire's roll is effectively 15, which is a successful casting (6-11) but not perfect (12). Sapphire's points: 9 (Success) Sapphire, adapting to the unexpected feeling of being a year younger suddenly, casts the Celestial Summon with grace and skill, conjuring a breathtaking expanse of twinkling stars and distant galaxies above the arena. The spectators gaze in awe, and Sapphire flashes a smile, trying to hide her confusion about the sensation she's experiencing. **Lily's First Turn:** (Lily has chosen to start with Glowing Garden to play with the strategy laid out for her.) Lily, with a sly grin, weaves her fingers through the air, and a myriad of glowing flowers burst forth from the ground, their light reflecting like tiny suns. *[Rolls Dice]* Dice roll result: 5 Lily's roll is well within the range for success (2-6) and hits the perfect mark (7). Lily's points: 10 (Perfect) Lily giggles and turns to Sapphire. \\"Oops, did I pick an easy one? Your move, champ!\\" With the score standing, Sapphire 9 - Lily 10, the magical duel continues, and Sapphire must choose her next spell carefully, considering the spells Lily might use and the growing age-related penalty to her rolls."},{"instruction":"I try to cast Glimmering Goliath","output":"As Sapphire, aware of the growing disadvantage with each spell she casts, you decide to go for one of the more challenging spells early in the match, hoping your current ability can still handle the intricacy of the incantation. You focus your intent on the Glimmering Goliath spell, seeking to conjure a towering figure of light to awe the judges and the audience. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire's turn to cast Glimmering Goliath...)* Dice roll result: 12 With a -2 penalty for regressing two years (now effectively being 14 years old), Sapphire's adjusted roll is 10. Unfortunately, this is below the threshold for the Glimmering Goliath (17+), so the spell fails to manifest. The crowd murmurs in shock as Sapphire's hands glow, but no Goliath forms. You feel the youthfulness of a 14-year-old, the spell's energy fizzling out without the Goliath's towering figure. This is not what you're known for, and determination flashes in your eyes despite the setback. Sapphire's points remain at 9. Lily claps her hands mockingly and says, \\"Uh oh, looks like someone's having an off day! Let's lighten things up!\\" **Lily's Turn:** Emboldened by Sapphire's failure, Lily opts for the Aquatic Arena spell, a slightly more challenging spell but still within her strategy to use the lower roll requirements. *(Rolling the dice for Lily's turn to cast Aquatic Arena...)* Dice roll result: 6 Lily's roll is a success (3-7), but not quite perfect (8). Lily masterfully creates a spectacle of leaping dolphins and swirling sea vines made of pure magic, which dance around the arena. Lily's points for success are 6, bringing her total to 16. As the glistening aquatic display dissipates, Lily turns back to Sapphire. \\"Don't give up, Sapphire! I want to see your beautiful magics, too!\\" she says with an impish and patronizing tone. The current score is Sapphire 9 - Lily 16, and the penalties are mounting against Sapphire, who now has to choose her next spell strategically while coping with the effects of Lily's sneaky spell."},{"instruction":"I try to cast Bloom of Frost","output":"Determined to regain her footing in this enchanted contest, you focus deeply as Sapphire and decide to cast Bloom of Frost, a spell that weaves beauty with the delicate touch of ice and snow. With two years already shaved off your age and the relentless penalty that comes with it, you call upon the depths of your magical prowess. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire's turn to cast Bloom of Frost...)* Dice roll result: 13 With the accumulated -3 penalty for regressing three years (now effectively being 13 years old), Sapphire's adjusted roll becomes a 10. The threshold for successfully casting Bloom of Frost is 12-17, with 18 being perfect. Despite your focused intentions, the spell fails to manifest in its full glory due to the penalty you have sustained. Sapphire's points remain at 9. The air chills slightly and a few solitary snowflakes drift down, but the full bloom of frost does not materialize. Sapphire conceals her mounting frustration behind a calm facade, even as her youthful visage becomes more noticeable to the crowd. Lily lets out a dramatic gasp. \\"Oh no, Sapphire, it seems you're under a chilly spell today! Let's hope you warm up soon!\\" she teases, enjoying her advantage. **Lily's Turn:** Lily seems to be biding her time, choosing her spells wisely to keep her advantage steady. She decides to go for the Whirlwind Waltz for her next spectacle. *(Rolling the dice for Lily's turn to cast Whirlwind Waltz...)* Dice roll result: 10 Lily's roll falls just short of the required range for success (13-18), so much like Sapphire, her spell fails to take form. Lily giggles nervously, trying to brush off her rare misstep. \\"Even the best of us slip up now and then, right?\\" she says, trying to maintain her confident exterior. The current score stands with Sapphire at 9 points and Lily at 16. Sapphire is younger after each spell and currently faces a -3 penalty on her dice rolls as the magic duel continues. Despite the setbacks, there's still a chance for a magical comeback if strategy and a bit of luck can tip the scales."},{"instruction":"I try to cast Mystic Mirage","output":"Sapphire takes a moment to gather her wits. Despite the youthful regression and Lily's underestimation, you focus on the beauty of the craft and not the contest. With a determined breath, you channel your energies into the creation of the Mystic Mirage, a spell of unpredictable beauty that constantly shifts to mesmerize all who view it. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire's turn to cast Mystic Mirage...)* Dice roll result: 14 Accounting for the three-year age regression penalty (-3), Sapphire's adjusted roll is an 11. The Mystic Mirage has a success threshold of 11-16 and requires a 17 for a perfect casting. Sapphire successfully casts the spell! The arena fills with fantastical visions; an enchanted forest here, a majestic castle there, all shifting and changing in an endless dance of color and form. This display earns Sapphire the judges' admiration. Sapphire's points for a successful Mystic Mirage amount to 14, bringing her total to 23. As the mirage fades, Sapphire looks at the crowd, a mix of youth and experience in her eyes, and then at Lily, with a gentle, yet confident smile. \\"Sometimes, the most unexpected images make the greatest impact, don't you think, Lily?\\" Sapphire states, regaining some of her earlier champion poise. **Lily's Turn:** Lily, undeterred by her previous misstep and buoyed by the thrill of competition, decides it's time to show off with the Harmonic Hymn, a spell requiring precision to turn music into visible wonder. *(Rolling the dice for Lily's turn to cast Harmonic Hymn...)* Dice roll result: 12 Lily's roll is just within the success range (7-12), though it misses a perfect casting by one (13). She weaves her hands through the air and soon the arena is filled with the visual spectacle of musical notes floating gracefully through the air, creating an enchanting symphony that brings contented sighs from the audience. Lily earns 10 points for a successful Harmonic Hymn, which brings her total to 26. With a playful bow, Lily turns to Sapphire, \\"Music to my eyes! Let's keep this beautiful battle going.\\" The current score is now Sapphire at 23 points and Lily at 26. The exhibition match is narrowing down, and Sapphire must deal tactically with the increasing penalties to clinch victory."},{"instruction":"I try to cast Phoenix Flare","output":"Recognizing the need to captivate the audience with something extraordinary, you decide to call upon the impressive Phoenix Flare. It's a bold choice, especially as the brief fatigue of the ongoing age reduction washes over Sapphire. You hope to grasp the raw essence of the spell in spite of the dwindling odds and capture a moment of fiery splendor. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire's turn to cast Phoenix Flare...)* Dice roll result: 16 Considering the -4 penalty for four years of age regression (now effectively being 12 years old), Sapphire's adjusted roll is a 12. Phoenix Flare needs a roll between 10-15 for a success, and 16 for a perfect cast. Against all odds, Sapphire manages to conjure the Phoenix Flare! With a flourish of your young hands, a magnificent phoenix made of dancing flames and shimmering embers appears, soaring through the arena before vanishing in a burst of radiant sparks that leave the spectators in a hushed awe. Sapphire's skilled success adds 13 points, bringing her tally up to 36. Lingering wisps of firelight still dancing in the air, Sapphire turns to Lily, her eyes reflecting the phoenix's glow, \\"May our spells continue to rise from the challenges, just like the phoenix from its ashes.\\" **Lily's Turn:** With the stakes growing higher and the match drawing closer, Lily can feel the excitement from the crowd. She selects the spell Tempest Tapestry, hoping to counter Sapphire’s display with the chaotic beauty of a storm. *(Rolling the dice for Lily's turn to cast Tempest Tapestry...)* Dice roll result: 15 Lily's attempt at the spell is well within the success range (8-13) and even hits the perfect cast threshold (14). Lily conducts the air as if directing a symphony, and a breathtaking scene of a storm unfolds. Rain lashes and lightning crackles in a tapestry that looks so real, some of the audience members flinch from the \\"rain.\\" Lily earns 22 points for her perfect Tempest Tapestry, taking her score to an impressive 48. She tosses her head back with delighted laughter, the energy ripples through the faux storm she's crafted. \\"Thrilling, isn't it? The might of nature is a perfect partner in our dance of spells!\\" The score is now Sapphire at 36 points and Lily at 48. The magical duel is intensifying as the two mages pour their hearts into the art of their craft, with penalties mounting and the list of available spells dwindling. Sapphire must be strategic and persistent to try to turn the tide."},{"instruction":"I try to cast Lunar Lattice","output":"Reinvigorated by the crowd's reaction to her previous spell and resolved to bridge the gap in points, you prepare for Sapphire to channel her magic into conjuring the ethereal Lunar Lattice. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire's turn to cast Lunar Lattice...)* Dice roll result: 18 With the -4 penalty for the four-year age regression (now effectively 12 years old), Sapphire's adjusted roll is 14. Fortunately, this is enough to successfully cast the Lunar Lattice, requiring a 9-14 for success and 15 for a perfect cast. With a graceful sweep of her hands, Sapphire summons a silver lattice that ripples across the sky, sparkling under the artificial moonlight created by her will. The intricate pattern holds the attention of every onlooker, its tranquil beauty a stark contrast to the fierce energy of the phoenix from before. Sapphire earns 12 points for a successful Lunar Lattice, bringing her to a total of 48. As the lattice fades, carrying with it the hushed whispers of the night, Sapphire looks towards Lily, her eyes gleaming with friendly competition. \\"The moon’s grace is unmatched, providing a quiet moment amid our vibrant duel, wouldn't you agree?\\" **Lily's Turn:** Not one to be easily outshone, Lily prepares to cast her next spell, feeling the pressure to maintain her lead. She plans to enchant the onlookers with the Diamond Deluge, aiming for the rain of light to reflect her sparkling ambition. *(Rolling the dice for Lily's turn to cast Diamond Deluge...)* Dice roll result: 17 Lily's roll is seamlessly within the success range (14-19) of the Diamond Deluge, but it doesn't hit the perfect casting threshold (20). With an effortless flick of her wrist, she creates a shimmering shower of ethereal diamonds that cascade down, twinkling so brilliantly they mimic a clear night sky full of stars. Lily gains 17 points for a successful Diamond Deluge, which brings her total to 65. With pride in her eyes, Lily declares, \\"Dazzling, isn't it? Like a treasure trove of stars, right here in our grasp!\\" The current tally stands with Sapphire at 48 points and Lily at 65. As the exhibition match nears its conclusion, Sapphire knows her next choices will be crucial to close the score gap while staving off the impact of the youthful curse Lily has cunningly cast."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Разбавление кофе: Добавление молока снижает концентрацию кофеина в напитке, поэтому действие кофе может быть менее выраженным. 2. Воздействие молока на кофейные алкалоиды: Молоко может взаимодействовать с кофейными алкалоидами, влияя на их усваиваемость в организме или снижая их стимулирующее действие. 3. Различная чувствительность к кофе и молоку: У каждого человека индивидуальная чувствительность к кофеину и молоку. Некоторые могут легко переносить кофеин, в то время как другие могут иметь более выраженные реакции на него. 4. Привыкание: Если вы привыкли пить кофе с молоком и делаете это регулярно, ваш организм может быть привыкшим к такому типу напитка, и его бодрящее действие может быть менее заметным. Важно отметить, что эти объяснения могут быть индивидуальными, и каждый может иметь свою собственную реакцию на кофе с молоком."},{"instruction":"Собери мне игровой компьютер за 150 тысяч","output":"Конфигурация игрового компьютера может варьироваться в зависимости от цен и доступности комплектующих на момент покупки.

He comes to visit a class of 6 year old kids in first grade learning magic to show them some spells. The star struck kids wonder if Rai was this amazing when he was their age too. The young and cheeky instructor, 12 year old Lily, comes up with an idea and suggests to temporarily regress Rai in age to the age of the kids so he can join the other kids in class and they can see how he was when he was their age. Rai is uncertain if it's a good idea, but the kids are too excited with the idea and Rai feels bad about letting them down, so he agrees. Lily starts casting on him the spell and says to him babyish things as he regresses in front of the kids, who giggle at the scene. He regresses to a 6 year old in oversized clothes and feels embarrassed, younger, and less confident than before. The class continues with Rai joining the kids, but he's unable to cast any spell, while the other kids can. Lily teases Rai and the other kids laugh at his expense. Rai has enough of this mockery and demands to be turned back to normal, but Lily refuses and says that since he's acting like a little kid, he deserves to remain a little kid. Write in no less than 3000 words.","output":"The room was alive with an aura of anticipation, only outperformed by the warm light filtering through the stained-glass windows which painted the classroom in vibrant hues. Six-year-olds, with their tiny wands and bright eyes, were barely contained by their excitement at the arrival of Rai, the reigning champion in the teen division of the magical duels. The whispers among them crescendoed into an orchestral hum as he strode through the door. The 16-year-old wore his raven-hair swept back and his deep blue robe trimmed with gold—a symbol of his esteemed title. His presence commanded the room's attention, the air charged with his power and youthful confidence. These children had seen Rai duel; they had seen his spells blaze through the sky, fierce and true. They idolized him, sure that he must have always been extraordinary, even as one of their own. Rai approached the children with an easy smile that held the tranquil ferocity of a dormant volcano. \\"Hello everyone,\\" he greeted, his voice an enchanting melody that expressed kindness and strength in equal measure. The pupils answered in an excited chorus, slipping from their seats to gather around him, their expressions a mix of adoration and wonder. And then there was Lily, the young instructor whose gifted supervision had earned her the role despite her tender age of 12. She had a mischievous glint in her hazel eyes, framed by curls as wild as the wind. As the class tried to process Rai's grand presence among them, Lily recognized the children’s unspoken longing to see if the champion had once been just like them. Smiling with an impish glint, she voiced a daring proposition, \\"Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could see Rai perform magic when he was your age?\\" A crowd of eager nods and hopeful faces turned to Rai, the silence a heavy cloak that wrapped around him. He saw himself in their wide, expectant eyes, and though uncertainty fluttered within him, Rai couldn't find the heart to decline. \\"All right,\\" he conceded. \\"But only if it's a temporary change.\\" Lily's eyes sparkled. “Of course, Rai. It will be our little secret—to see if the greatest of us started out just as humble.\\" Gathering her energy, Lily chanted the incantation, her wand tracing an intricate pattern in the air above Rai's head. Her words carried weight—words that should be far beyond her years—and yet she spoke them with the casual toss of a stone skipping across water. Rai, standing like a statue among the throng of little heads, could feel the spell tug at his essence. For just a breath, he felt nothing, and then it surged, an invisible wave washing over him. Lily’s voice, teasing and tender as if she were speaking to an actual infant, wove through the enchantment, \\"How's our big boy doing? Ready to be little again?\\" Sniggers and hushed giggles peppered the air as Rai's body twisted inward—shrinking, softening, clothes ballooning on his now-diminutive frame. After a few moments of magical reverberation, where the lines of his face softened and his hands looked for palms they once filled, Rai stood as though time had melted off a decade. Even his robe seemed to embrace the change in its wearer, the fabric flowing like a river around him, enveloping him in a cloak far too grand for his small frame. Rai’s feet barely peeked out from the heavy hem that now grazed the floor. Awash in light and laughter, Rai, now barely taller than a broomstick, lifted his face—flushed with embarrassment—and addressed the room's titters. “Please,\\" he pleaded, his voice now higher in pitch, the voice of a child. “Let’s...let’s just continue with the class.” Eyes still brimming with mirth, Lily gave a jolly nod, and what ensued was an amusing, yet uncomfortable spectacle. The children, each with their own miniature wand, managed to produce little sparks and puffs of glitter, their abilities as budding as spring flowers. Rai, on the other hand, just stood there, his small hand clutching his shrunk wand, a tool he once wielded with precision, now proving unyielding and foreign. Lily's gaze bore into Rai, and she couldn’t help but comment, with her cheeks dimpled in untamed humor, \\"Oh, champion Rai! Can't you even conjure a little spark? My grandmother's cat could do better magic!\\" Laughter erupted anew, the carefree kind that bubbles from the young and guileless. But for Rai, each chuckle was a barbed jest, a prick to his now tender pride. A scowl drew his brows together, the sparkle that once danced in his eyes replaced by a crackling fire. \\"This isn't fair,\\" he protested, his expression as thunderous as only a child's can be. \\"I demand to be returned to my true age!\\" Lily, still between laughter and an appreciation for her magical handiwork, shook her head. “You’re acting like a little kid, so if you can’t listen and learn, maybe you deserve to stay one for a bit longer.” With Rai's demands dismissed to the background noise of children practicing their spells, his protests petered out into silence, a cloud of helplessness descending upon his miniature shoulders. The dueling champion, once fearless and proud, now faced a different form of battle—one against the whims of a room filled with children, a teacher too pleased with her prank, and his own smallness, inside and out. The anticipated lesson may have taken an unintended turn, but the class would certainly not forget the day Rai, the teen dueling champion, came to visit—and neither, with a gnawing sense of indignation and longing for his true strength, would Rai."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like you've accidentally left your question blank.

On January 24, 2023, Hindenburg Research released a report alleging that the Adani Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, was involved in a long history of stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The report claims that the Adani Group, led by Gautam Adani—who at the time was one of the richest individuals in the world—had taken part in a complex scheme of financial manipulation and corporate malfeasance over the course of decades. According to the report, the group's companies had artificially inflated revenues and share prices, among other questionable practices. Some key allegations included in the Hindenburg Research report are: - Overvaluation of shares: The report suggested the share prices of Adani Group companies had been purposefully inflated through coordinated trades to give a false impression of financial health and performance. - Complex web of offshore shell companies: The report alleged that the Adani Group controlled numerous shell companies in offshore tax havens, which were purportedly used to facilitate the above-mentioned market manipulation and siphoning of money. - Misuse of tax havens and money laundering: The report accused the group of using a network of entities in tax havens like Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean for potential stock manipulation and money laundering. - Questionable use of related-party transactions: Hindenburg Research's report suggested that the Adani Group engaged in transactions with related parties that might not have been conducted at arm's length, which might have served to conceal the true financial state of the companies involved. Following the publication of the report, the stock prices of Adani Group companies plummeted, causing significant market value losses. The Adani Group has vehemently denied the allegations, calling the report baseless and intending to damage the group's reputation and the nation's financial stability. The release of the Hindenburg report has led to wider concerns about corporate governance, debt levels, and transparency in India's corporate sector. It has also attracted the attention of regulatory bodies and has sparked debate over foreign investment risks in the country. Investors, regulators, and market analysts continue to monitor the situation for any further developments. The actual impact of the Hindenburg report's allegations on the Adani Group and the broader Indian market will likely unfold over time as investigations proceed and more information becomes available."},{"instruction":"Your language model","output":"I am OpenAI's GPT-3, the third generation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, which is a state-of-the-art language processing AI model.

Each chapter delves into a separate branch, providing practical examples and straightforward explanations to demonstrate how philosophy informs and enriches our daily existence. **Introduction** Philosophy, from the ancient Greek words \\"philo,\\" meaning love, and \\"sophia,\\" meaning wisdom, is the love of wisdom. It prompts us to examine fundamental questions about our existence, morality, knowledge, and the very fabric of reality. This book aims to distill complex concepts into relatable and practical applications, revealing how philosophy is not just an academic subject but a vital part of everyday life. **Chapter 1: Metaphysics - The Nature of Reality** Metaphysics asks what is truly real, exploring concepts of existence, being, and reality. - **Ontology:** Understand what it means for something to exist. For instance, debating whether numbers are real or constructs helps us ponder what qualifies as existence. - **Free Will vs. Determinism:** Consider whether your choices are truly free or predetermined, which can shape our sense of agency and responsibility. - **Dualism and Materialism:** Explore the mind-body connection by examining if consciousness is separate from physical matter or a result of it. **Chapter 2: Epistemology - The Study of Knowledge** Epistemology examines the nature and limits of knowledge. - **Justified True Belief:** Compare believing something because of evidence (like trusting scientific methods) versus belief without justification (like superstitions). - **Skepticism:** Challenge what you consider to be undeniable knowledge, such as the reality of the external world or other minds. - **Theories of Truth:** Compare everyday claims to philosophical theories of truth, like coherence, correspondence, and pragmatic theories. **Chapter 3: Ethics - The Examination of Morality** Ethics delves into questions of right, wrong, virtue, and justice. - **Normative Ethics:** Consider decisions you make, such as lying to protect someone's feelings, through the lens of ethical theories like utilitarianism or deontological ethics. - **Applied Ethics:** Tackle modern dilemmas such as the ethics of AI, environmental responsibility, or bioethical issues in medicine. - **Virtue Ethics:** Reflect on personal traits and habits, thinking about how they shape character and moral behavior. **Chapter 4: Political Philosophy - The State and the Individual** Political Philosophy scrutinizes the relationship between society, state, and individuals. - **Social Contract Theory:** Reflect on the implicit agreements you follow as part of a society, like abiding by laws for the common good. - **Justice and Equality:** Consider issues like wealth distribution, healthcare, and education rights within your own community. - **Authority and Legitimacy:** Question what makes governmental power legitimate, and if there's a right to civil disobedience. **Chapter 5: Aesthetics - The Philosophy of Art and Beauty** Aesthetics explores ideas about what is beautiful or artistic. - **Art Criticism:** Discuss whether beauty is subjective while visiting an art gallery or listening to music. What makes art, 'art'? - **The Purpose of Art:** Reflect on how art affects you personally. Does it need to serve a purpose? Does it communicate universal truths or provide personal insights? - **Art and Ethics:** Consider if and how art should be censored. Should artwork be judged by the morality of the artist or the content? **Chapter 6: Logic - The Structure of Argument** Logic assesses the principles of valid reasoning and sound argument. - **Identifying Fallacies:** Recognize faulty reasoning in everyday debates and discussions, such as ad hominem attacks or straw man arguments. - **Constructing Arguments:** Practice constructing logical arguments to persuade others, from debates at work to encouraging healthy habits in children. - **Conditional Reasoning:** Apply if-then scenarios in decision-making processes, assessing outcomes based on different conditions. **Chapter 7: Philosophy of Science - The Underpinnings of Scientific Inquiry** Philosophy of Science investigates the foundations, methods, and implications of science. - **Scientific Methods:** Analyze the research process in everyday scientific claims, distinguishing pseudoscience from robust science. - **Theory and Observation:** Discuss the role of observation and experimentation in forming scientific theories, such as climate change hypotheses. - **Science and Society:** Explore how scientific advances affect ethical and moral perspectives, such as genetic editing. **Chapter 8: Philosophy of Mind - Consciousness and Thought** Philosophy of Mind ponders the nature of consciousness, thoughts, and experiences. - **Mind vs. Brain:** Debate whether your mind is simply brain activity or something more, considering experiences like dreams or intuition. - **Artificial Intelligence:** Question if machines could ever possess consciousness or if there is something unique about human experience. - **Personal Identity:** Examine what makes you 'you.' Is it your memories, your body, or something else that defines personal identity? **Chapter 9: Philosophy of Language - The Role of Language in Human Life** Philosophy of Language examines the relation between language, meaning, and communication. - **Meaning and Interpretation:** Reflect on how language shapes thinking, discussing words with multiple meanings or translations. - **Language and Reality:** Consider if the language you speak influences your perception of reality—do speakers of different languages experience the world differently? - **Linguistic Ethics:** Address the power of language in shaping opinions and prejudices, such as the use of propaganda or biased terminology. **Chapter 10: Philosophy of Religion - Faith, Reason, and Belief** Philosophy of Religion tackles questions about the divine, faith, and religious practices. - **Arguments for and against God's Existence:** Unpack classic arguments like the cosmological argument or the problem of evil. - **Faith vs. Rational Belief:** Consider whether religious faith is compatible with reason or if they occupy distinct domains. - **Religious Experience:** Share and examine personal experiences or historical accounts of religious or mystical experiences and their validity. **Chapter 11: Existentialism - The Quest for Meaning** Existentialism addresses human freedom and the search for meaning in life. - **Authenticity:** Reflect on moments where you've had to make choices that define you, like choosing a career path or standing up for beliefs. - **The Absurd:** Confront the concept of absurdity in life.

Whether looking at a tree or thinking of a friend, consciousness is always directed. - **Perception:** Analyze how perception shapes your reality, considering how things appear differently under varying circumstances (e.g., an oasis in a desert). - **Embodiment:** Explore how your physical presence and body sensations contribute to your experience of the world. **Chapter 13: Eastern Philosophies - Diverse Worldviews** Eastern philosophies offer a broad spectrum of thought distinct from Western traditions. - **Buddhism and Impermanence:** Notice the transient nature of life and whether this awareness affects attachment to material possessions or relationships. - **Taoism and Harmony:** Observe instances where going with the flow (like water) leads to harmony and efficiency in life. - **Confucianism and Relationships:** Reflect on the role of tradition, respect, and family in shaping societal and personal ethics. **Conclusion** \\"Philosophy in Everyday Life\\" is not exhaustive but serves as an introduction to the broad-ranging field of philosophy and its practical applications. Philosophy equips us with the tools to navigate our lives thoughtfully and purposefully. It encourages inquiry, fosters debate, and, most importantly, teaches us to never stop asking questions. **Epilogue** Philosophical thinking does not end with the closing of a book. It continues as you engage with the world around you, with others, and most importantly, with yourself. Remember that the journey of philosophy is unending, filled with wonder and the potential for continuous growth. (Note: This overview outlines a conceptual structure for a book on philosophy with practical examples. A full-length book would explore each chapter's themes in greater detail, ideally extending beyond 2000 lines to cover the nuances of philosophical discourse adequately.)"},{"instruction":"","output":"It looks like your message was empty.

The campaign involved a nationwide march aimed at addressing and protesting against the social, economic, and political issues facing the country. It was intended to rally citizens against the ruling party's policies and to promote national unity, social harmony, and communal amity. The yatra (march) was led by Rahul Gandhi, a prominent leader of the INC and a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family that has played a significant role in Indian politics. The march began on September 7, 2022, from Kanyakumari in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and was planned to cover multiple states, reaching its conclusion in the northernmost part of India in Jammu and Kashmir. The yatra aimed to symbolically bridge the gaps between different sections of Indian society, including caste, religion, and region, while also highlighting the economic challenges like unemployment and inflation. The Congress party saw it as a means to connect with citizens at the grassroots level and to revitalize the party's fortunes after several electoral setbacks. The march consisted of walks, public meetings, and interactions with citizens across the country. It served as a platform for the INC to voice its criticisms of the policies of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and to strengthen the opposition in the lead-up to the general elections scheduled for 2024."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Heavy metal weights lined the walls, covered in a thick layer of dust, and old gym equipment was scattered haphazardly. The room seemed frozen in time, forgotten and abandoned. A rusty and creaking weightlifting bench stood in the center, its cracked leather cushion worn down from years of use. The barbell, coated in rust, rested on metallic pegs, deprived of the sound of clanging plates. Dumbbells of different sizes were strewn across the floor, hinting at the past users' exertion. The environment was haunting, with faded motivational posters peeling off the walls, their once vibrant colors now washed out. The smell of sweat and mold lingered in the air, adding to the gloomy atmosphere of the room. The only source of natural light was a small, grimy window covered in grime that allowed dusty rays to penetrate and create a patchy illumination. The composition of the room was chaotic, mirroring the disarray of the equipment. Weights were left unorganized, haphazardly placed on shelves and racks. The room's layout felt cramped and claustrophobic, with bulky machines crowding the limited space. A solitary mirror hung crookedly on one wall, reflecting a distorted image of the neglected room. The scene exuded a sense of melancholy and nostalgia, inviting contemplation and reflection. It felt as though the ghosts of past fitness enthusiasts still lingered, their aspirations and efforts echoing through the empty walls. The dim lighting cast long shadows, adding to the somber ambiance of the room. Realization: This prompt calls for a realistic photographic style, capturing the scene with a Nikon D810 camera equipped with a wide-angle lens, such as a 24mm, to encompass the entirety of the room. The chosen lens would allow for a deep depth of field, emphasizing the details of the dilapidated equipment. The composition should focus on highlighting the contrasts between light and dark, as well as the individual elements within the room, conveying the desolation and forlornness. /imagine prompt: In the 1990s, there was an equipment room for exercising, with flickering fluorescent lights casting eerie shadows on the threadbare carpet. Pulsing with a dull hum, the room felt stale and suffocating, as if the air held the weight of forgotten dreams. The environment was cluttered with equipment strewn carelessly around. Worn-out treadmills with faded LCD screens stood against the wall, the sound of their mechanical belts echoing through the room. Tangled wires and dangling cables added to the chaotic atmosphere, creating a maze of obstacles amidst old exercise bikes and rowing machines. The compositions within the room were disjointed, as if pieces of a puzzle scattered randomly. Dumbbells abandoned on a sweat-stained mat, a resistance band hanging limply from an overhead rack, and discarded water bottles rolling against the rusty edges of weight plates. The remnants of past workouts littered the space, as if time had stopped mid-exercise. The scene evoked a sense of desolation and weariness, with a heavy weight pressing down on the room. The faded walls bore the marks of sweaty palms and intermittent motivational posters, their words barely discernible. The air smelled of stale sweat and rubber, mingling with the metallic tang of old exercise equipment. Realization: This prompt calls for an artwork style, merging surrealism and photorealism. The image should appear as a mixture of digital art and painting, seamlessly blending elements from both. The stylized environment should highlight the disarray of the room, with exaggerated perspectives and distorted proportions. The color palette should lean towards muted tones, emphasizing the wear and tear of the equipment and contributing to the eerie atmosphere. /imagine prompt: In the 1990s, there was an equipment room for exercising, tucked away in the basement of an old building. Dim flickering lights, reminiscent of an old horror movie, cast unsettling shadows across the room. The air was thick and stagnant, carrying the whispers of forgotten goals and unfinished workouts. The environment exuded decay, with peeling wallpaper revealing layers of history and grime accumulated over the years. Broken mirrors reflected fragmented images and distorted forms, adding to the eerie ambiance. The sound of dripping water echoed in the background, a reminder of the room's remoteness and limited use. The compositions within the room were deliberately staged, showcasing the remnants of past fitness endeavors. An abandoned rowing machine occupied the center, its seats covered in torn upholstery. Surrounding it, exercise balls lay deflated, their vibrant colors faded away. The walls were adorned with ripped workout routines and faded weightlifting charts, no longer serving their purpose. The scene exuded a haunted atmosphere, conjuring a feeling of unease and nostalgia. A sense of isolation and abandonment hung in the air, as if the room was a forgotten relic trapped in time. The dim lighting further intensified the brooding atmosphere, bringing the shadows to life and creating an eerie dance of light and darkness. Realization: This prompt calls for an illustration style, specifically digital art. The illustrations should capture the gloomy and immersive environment, showcasing the minutiae details of the dilapidated room. The use of textured brushes and muted colors will enhance the sense of decay and desolation. The composition should focus on creating depth within the scene, drawing the viewer's attention to specific elements of the room, such as the broken mirrors or the dilapidated rowing machine. /imagine prompt: In the 1990s, there was an equipment room dedicated to exercise, suffused with a dim, ambient glow. The walls were draped in dark fabric, absorbing light and creating an otherworldly atmosphere. Hazy rays of sunlight filtered through a small window, casting ethereal patterns on the weathered hardwood floor. The environment was sparsely furnished, with minimalistic exercise equipment placed with intention. A solitary barbell adorned with rusted plates leaned against the wall, creating a striking visual contrast. Weights of different sizes hung suspended from the ceiling, their reflective surfaces catching glimmers of light. The compositions within the room were carefully arranged, creating a sense of harmony amidst the gloom. A row of exercise mats lined the wall, parallel to the barbell, evoking a sense of symmetry. The room embodied a serene minimalism, with only essential elements occupying the space, free from clutter and distractions. The scene emanated a contemplative and peaceful ambiance, inviting introspection and mindfulness. The dim lighting cast soft shadows, creating an intimate setting for introspection and personal growth. The stillness of the room contrasted with the potential energy inherent within the weights, evoking a sense of balance and harmony. Realization: This prompt calls for a sculpture style.

Определите соотношение устной и письменной речи. 11. Назовите виды и формы общения. Кратко охарактеризуйте монолог и диалог. 12. Назовите структуру информационной речи. 13. Назовите структуру убеждающей речи. 14. Определите невербальную коммуникацию. Назовите основные единицы. 15. Назовите основные требования к публичному выступлению","output":"10. Соотношение устной и письменной речи зависит от контекста коммуникации. Устная речь характеризуется тем, что происходит лицом к лицу или через аудио-средства (телефон, радио), и часто непосредственна, но может быть и заранее подготовленной (как в публичных выступлениях). Письменная речь предполагает фиксацию на письме, сохраняется во времени и обычно продумывается более тщательно, предназначена для чтения. В современных средствах коммуникации границы могут размываться, например, письменная речь может быть динамичной и мгновенной (чаты, мессенджеры), а устная – сохраняться и распространяться, как в случае с аудиозаписями и подкастами. 11. **Виды и формы общения:** - Устное общение: деловые и личные встречи, телефонные разговоры, аудиоконференции. - Письменное общение: письма, отчеты, текстовые сообщения, электронная переписка. - Невербальное общение: мимика, жесты, телодвижения, почерк. Монолог – речь одного человека, направленная к одному или нескольким слушателям, без предположения немедленного ответа (пример: лекция, выступление). Диалог – взаимные речевые обмены между двумя или более участниками, предполагает чередование ролей говорящего и слушающего (пример: беседа, интервью). 12. Структура информационной речи обычно включает: - Введение, в котором представляется тема и цель выступления. - Основная часть, где подробно излагается информация, факты, обоснования. - Заключение, в котором проводится обобщение представленной информации и подчеркиваются ключевые моменты. 13. Структура убеждающей речи: - Вступление, направленное на привлечение внимания и формирование интереса к теме. - Постановка проблемы возникновения, в которой показывается актуальность и важность обсуждения. - Аргументация, где представляются убедительные аргументы для поддержки точки зрения. - Опровержение возможных возражений или альтернативных взглядов. - Выводы, где говорящий подводит итог своей аргументации и призывает к действию или изменению мнения. 14. **Невербальная коммуникация** – это передача информации без использования слов, через мимику, жесты, позы, телодвижения, взгляд, интонацию голоса, паузы, дистанцию между собеседниками и другие неязыковые средства. Основные единицы невербальной коммуникации включают: - Кинесика (язык телодвижений) - Проксемика (использование личного пространства) - Оккулесика (язык взглядов) - Хаптика (сенсорный контакт – прикосновение) - Парадинамика (силуэт, поза, напряжение) 15. **Основные требования к публичному выступлению:** - Понятность и ясность изложения. - Логичность и последовательность презентации материала. - Адекватность содержания и стиль выступления целевой аудитории. - Эффективное использование невербальных средств — жесты, мимика, внешний вид. - Захватывающее и убедительное вступление и заключение. - Грамотное использование визуальных материалов (если применимо). - Умение устанавливать и поддерживать контакт с аудиторией. - Владение техниками управления волнением и стрессом."},{"instruction":"Какая белковая еда бедных","output":"Термин \\"еда бедных\\" может иметь разные значения в разных регионах, культурах и исторических периодах. Однако, если говорить о белковой еде, которая обычно доступна за небольшие деньги и предпочтительна в бюджетных условиях, то можно выделить несколько широко распространенных продуктов: 1. Бобовые: Фасоль, чечевица, горох, бобы и нут являются отличными источниками растительного белка, а также волокон, которые могут быть достаточно недорогими, особенно если их покупать в больших упаковках или оптом. 2. Яйца: Яйца содержат высококачественный белок и являются одним из наиболее экономичных животных источников белка, доступных большинству людей. 3. Мясо птицы: Курица обычно дешевле других видов мяса, таких как говядина или баранина. Куриные окорочка и бедра являются одними из самых бюджетных вариантов. 4. Растительные белки: Соевые продукты (тофу, темпе), сейтан (из пшеничного белка) и текстурированный растительный белок часто стоят недорого и могут служить заменителем мяса. 5. Молочные продукты: Молоко, творог и некоторые сыры (например, моцарелла) могут быть доступными источниками белка. 6. Цельнозерновые: Хотя они не являются основным источником белка, цельнозерновые продукты как добавка к бобовым могут улучшить качество белка в рационе. 7. Рыбные консервы: Тунец, сардины и другие виды рыбы в консервах могут быть экономичными источниками качественного белка, Омега-3 жирных кислот и других питательных веществ. Выбор белковой пищи на бюджетной основе часто зависит от региональности, цен, сельскохозяйственных и климатических условий, а также от личных предпочтений и диетических ограничений.

Here's a simple example to convert an Angular app into a microfrontend app: 1. Start by creating multiple Angular projects, each representing a microfrontend. For simplicity, let's create two projects: \`shell-app\` and \`micro-app\`. 2. In the \`shell-app\`, set up a router to handle navigation between microfrontends. Install the \`@angular/router\` package if it's not already installed. 3. Create a new route in the \`shell-app\` router configuration for each microfrontend, pointing to a unique path. For example: \`\`\` const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', redirectTo: 'micro-app', pathMatch: 'full' }, { path: 'micro-app', loadChildren: () => import('./micro-app/micro-app.module').then(m => m.MicroAppModule) }, ]; \`\`\` 4. In the \`micro-app\` project, create a new module \`MicroAppModule\` and configure its routes internally. This module should be responsible for rendering the microfrontend's components. 5. To allow communication between the microfrontends, you can use a shared service or a state management solution like NgRx. Here's an example of a shared service: In \`shell-app\`, create a shared service: \`\`\`typescript import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { Subject } from 'rxjs'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) export class SharedService { private messageSource = new Subject<string>(); message = this.messageSource.asObservable(); sendMessage(message: string) { this.messageSource.next(message); } } \`\`\` 6. Inject the shared service into the \`micro-app\` and use it to send/receive messages between microfrontends: In \`micro-app\`: \`\`\`typescript import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { SharedService } from '../shared.service'; @Component({ selector: 'app-micro-component', template: \` <h2>Microfrontend Component</h2> <button (click)=\\"sendMessage()\\">Send Message</button> <p>{{ receivedMessage }}</p> \`, }) export class MicroComponent { receivedMessage: string; constructor(private sharedService: SharedService) { sharedService.message.subscribe(msg => this.receivedMessage = msg); } sendMessage() { this.sharedService.sendMessage('Hello from Microfrontend!'); } } \`\`\` 7. Install dependencies and build both projects separately. For example, run \`ng build --project=shell-app\` to build the \`shell-app\`, and \`ng build --project=micro-app\` to build the \`micro-app\`. 8. Serve the built \`shell-app\` files with your preferred server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) and configure it to proxy requests to the \`micro-app\` based on routes. 9. Access the \`shell-app\` in your browser, and you should see the routing in action, with the \`micro-app\` loaded on demand. Remember that this is a simplified example. In a real microfrontend architecture, you might need more advanced techniques to handle things like shared styles, contexts, or lazy loading of microfrontends."},{"instruction":"В какой рыбе наибольшее содержание углеводов","output":"Рыбы по своей природе являются источником белка и в целом содержат низкое количество углеводов. В рыбе естественным образом углеводы встречаются в очень малых количествах или отсутствуют совсем. Большинство углеводов в рационе рыбы приходится на простые сахара и гликоген, однако их уровни обычно очень низкие. Если же речь идёт о промышленной обработанной рыбной продукции, такой как копчёная рыба, рыбные консервы в соусе или маринованная рыба, то наличие углеводов в таких продуктах может быть вызвано добавлением ингредиентов, содержащих углеводы, в процессе их производства. К таким добавкам могут относиться сахар, сиропы, мука (при панировке), соусы и маринады, содержащие крахмал или сахар. Следовательно, если вас интересует рыба с наибольшим содержанием углеводов, следует искать это в обработанных рыбных продуктах, а не в естественном составе самой рыбы."},{"instruction":"Fascism and communism couldn't be any more polar opposites, being far-right and far-left respectively, yet when, how and why did the two suddenly become interchangeable despite their obvious differences? Was it the Cold War? Did many actually believe the two were one and the same?","output":"Fascism and communism are indeed ideological polar opposites, with fascism being far-right and communism being far-left. However, during the Cold War, the political rhetoric and propaganda employed by the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, led to the perception of interchangeability between the two ideologies. During the Cold War (1947-1991), when the world was divided into two camps led by the US and the USSR, both sides attempted to discredit and undermine each other. Anti-communist sentiment was strong in the US, and to delegitimize communist movements and governments worldwide, they drew parallels between communism and fascism. This was primarily done to show the negative aspects of communist rule, by associating it with the horrors of fascism and Nazism in World War II. One significant factor contributing to this perception was the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (1939), a non-aggression treaty between the USSR and Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. This pact temporarily aligned the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, creating confusion and raising doubts about the supposed opposition between communism and fascism. The subsequent invasion of the USSR by Nazi Germany in 1941 ended this alliance, but the narrative persisted. Furthermore, both fascism and communism were totalitarian ideologies that sought to establish a strong centralized state control and suppress dissent. This similarity in authoritarian methods also contributed to blurring the lines between the two ideologies. The interchangeability of fascism and communism was, to some extent, a result of the political rhetoric and propaganda employed during the Cold War. However, it is important to note that many people did not actually believe or understand them to be the same. Intellectuals, political scientists, and historians have since pointed out the vast differences between the two ideologies and emphasized their opposition."},{"instruction":"Using the time of Ancient Greece and Rome to the Middle Ages to the Renaissance as an example, is the cycle of a period of progress in art, science, math and others that falls into a dark period which is the succeeded by a reawakening of that age of progress a universal constant?","output":"The idea of a cyclical pattern in history, where periods of progress are followed by dark periods and then reawakenings, is a concept that has been proposed by various historians and philosophers throughout history. However, it is important to note that this theory is not universally accepted, and different scholars have different interpretations of historical patterns. One example often cited is the notion of the \\"Dark Ages\\" in Europe, which refers to the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. During this time, there was a decline in centralized political authority, economic stability, and cultural achievements. However, it is worth mentioning that this term is now considered somewhat misleading and oversimplified, as recent scholarship has shown that there were significant advancements and cultural developments during this period, especially in the Islamic world and Byzantine Empire. Similarly, the Renaissance is often seen as a period of reawakening and progress in art, science, and culture following the Middle Ages. This period witnessed a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman ideas, leading to advancements in various fields. However, it is important to note that progress and setbacks can occur simultaneously in different regions and fields, and not all areas experienced the same patterns of development. It is also worth considering that historical patterns can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including political, economic, social, and cultural dynamics. Therefore, it is challenging to establish a universal constant or predictably recurring pattern across all historical periods and civilizations. While some historical periods may exhibit cyclical patterns of progress, decline, and reawakening, it is essential to approach this concept with caution and consider the specific context and complexities of each era. History is a complex tapestry of various forces and influences, and it is often difficult to reduce it to a simple and universal pattern."},{"instruction":"Are there non-European examples of this type of occurrence?","output":"Yes, there are non-European examples of periods of progress, decline, and reawakening in various civilizations throughout history. Here are a few examples: 1. Ancient Egypt: Ancient Egyptian civilization experienced periods of great progress and cultural achievements, such as the Old Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BCE) with its monumental pyramids and advancements in architecture and engineering. However, the civilization also faced periods of decline, such as the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2055 BCE), marked by political instability and economic difficulties. The Middle Kingdom (c. 2055-1650 BCE) then represented a reawakening, characterized by a resurgence of centralized authority, artistic achievements, and cultural development. 2. Ancient India: Indian history also exhibits cycles of progress and decline. For example, the Gupta Empire (c. 4th-6th century CE) is often referred to as the \\"Golden Age\\" of India, marked by advancements in science, mathematics, literature, and art. However, following the decline of the Gupta Empire, India witnessed periods of political fragmentation and invasions, such as during the medieval period. The subsequent rise of powerful empires like the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire represented a reawakening in various aspects of Indian culture and society. 3. Ancient China: Chinese history showcases cycles of progress and decline as well. The Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) is considered a period of great progress in governance, arts, and technology. However, the subsequent period known as the Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE) was marked by political fragmentation and warfare. The reunification under the Sui and Tang Dynasties (6th-10th century CE) represented a reawakening, characterized by advancements in art, literature, and the spread of Buddhism. These are just a few examples, and there are many more instances of cyclical patterns of progress, decline, and reawakening in various non-European civilizations throughout history. It is important to recognize that historical patterns can vary greatly across different regions and cultures, and each civilization has its unique trajectory of development and decline."},{"instruction":"simple example to convert angular app to microfrond app","output":"To convert an Angular app to a microfrontend app, you can follow these steps: 1. Identify components: In the Angular app, identify the components that can be treated as microfrontends. These components should be self-contained and independent modules that can function on their own. 2. Extract microfrontends: Extract the identified components into separate projects or repositories. Each microfrontend should have its own codebase, development environment, and build system. 3. Decentralize routing: Instead of having a single router within the Angular app, each microfrontend should have its own router. This allows each microfrontend to handle its own routing and navigation. 4. Communication and data sharing: Establish a communication mechanism between microfrontends to share data and interact with each other. This can be done through custom events, shared services, or a state management library like Redux. 5. Deploy and integrate: Deploy each microfrontend as a separate application and integrate them into a container application. The container application can be used to manage the routing and overall structure of the microfrontends. 6. Security considerations: Implement security measures like authentication and authorization at both the container application and microfrontend levels. Ensure that each microfrontend enforces its own security policies. Here is an example where an Angular app with three components (Header, Sidebar, and Content) is converted into microfrontends: 1. Identify components: Header, Sidebar, and Content components can be treated as microfrontends. 2. Extract microfrontends: Create separate projects or repositories for each microfrontend, placing the relevant code and dependencies in their respective projects. 3. Decentralize routing: Each microfrontend will have its own routing mechanism, handling its own routes independently. 4. Communication and data sharing: Use a shared service or custom events to enable communication and data sharing between microfrontends, e.g., Header and Sidebar might communicate to update Content component based on user actions. 5. Deploy and integrate: Deploy each microfrontend as a separate application and integrate them into a container application. The container application may handle overall navigation and routing. 6. Security considerations: Implement security measures at both the container and microfrontend levels, ensuring proper authentication and authorization for each microfrontend.

Он разделяет экономическую активность на четыре квадранта на основе спроса и предложения, разделяя их на комбинации высокого и низкого уровня каждого из этих факторов. Однако понятие \\"The Four Quadrants\\" стало популярным и в других областях. Например, оно широко используется в лидерстве и саморазвитии для классификации различных поведенческих и личностных стилей. В этом контексте, пространство разделено на четыре квадранта, каждый из которых представляет определенный тип поведения или личностный стиль. Благодаря этому анализу, люди могут получить более глубокое понимание себя и других, а также определить свои сильные и слабые стороны. Концепция \\"The Four Quadrants\\" также находит применение в многих других областях, таких как менеджмент, маркетинг, планирование, стратегия, оценка проектов и даже в анализе данных.

(Applause fills the studio as the guest walks on stage with a warm smile. They exchange pleasantries with the host and take their seat.) Host: Thank you for joining us today, (guest's name). Let's dive right into the story that has captivated the nation. How did this incident unfold, and what were the consequences? Guest: Thank you for having me, (host's name). So, here's what happened: a company employee was caught watching inappropriate videos during work hours. Unbeknownst to them, their actions were recorded by another employee and widely shared online, bringing immense public humiliation to the company. It caused an uproar on social media, and the company became a laughing stock, damaging its reputation instantly. Host: It's disheartening to witness such incidents unfold. Can you shed some light on how these events affected the company, the boss, and the morale of the employees? Guest: Absolutely. The company was severely impacted by this situation. First and foremost, the reputation took a massive hit, and potential clients and partners might have lost trust in their professionalism. Internally, employees suffered from the sudden influx of negative attention, which led to a decrease in morale, productivity, and overall trust. But it's important to remember that it's not just the employee involved who bears the consequences but the entire company. Host: Indeed, a ripple effect that impacts everyone involved. Now, let's shift our focus to the boss. What measures should they take to earn back the trust of their employees and stakeholder community? Guest: Well, it's a long road to redemption, but it starts with acknowledging the mistake openly and honestly. The boss needs to address the incident head-on by conducting a thorough investigation and taking appropriate disciplinary action against the employee involved. After that, they should develop and implement a comprehensive code of conduct or ethics policy that emphasizes professionalism and respects the company's values. It is vital for the boss to lead by example, demonstrating their commitment to rebuilding the organization's reputation by being transparent, approachable, and accountable. Host: Excellent points, (guest's name). Ultimately, it's about establishing an environment where everyone can feel supported and regain confidence in the brand. What role do you think the employees play in rebuilding trust after a scandal? Guest: Great question, (host's name). Employees are at the core of any organization, and their support is instrumental in the recovery process. They need to be empowered to voice their concerns and provide input on any measures taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. It's also crucial for the employees to become brand ambassadors and actively participate in rebuilding the company's reputation through their work, professionalism, and dedication. Host: Absolutely! Collaboration and unity are essential to overcoming such challenges. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much, (guest's name), for sharing your valuable insights on this delicate matter. Guest: It was my pleasure, (host's name). Thank you for having me on the show today.

Instala la biblioteca de ChatterBot: Utiliza pip para instalar la biblioteca de ChatterBot y sus dependencias: \`\`\` pip install chatterbot \`\`\` 4. Crea un archivo para la IA: Dentro de Termux, utiliza tu editor de texto favorito (como nano o vim) para crear un nuevo archivo Python. Por ejemplo: \`\`\` nano ai.py \`\`\` 5. Escribe el código de la IA: Dentro del archivo \\"ai.py\\", puedes escribir el código de la IA utilizando la biblioteca de ChatterBot. Aquí tienes un ejemplo básico: \`\`\`python from chatterbot import ChatBot # Crea una instancia de ChatBot bot = ChatBot('Mi ChatBot') # Entrena al ChatBot bot.train([ 'Hola', '¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte?' ]) # Obtiene una respuesta del ChatBot respuesta = bot.get_response('Hola') print(respuesta) \`\`\` 6. Guarda y cierra el archivo: En nano, puedes guardar el archivo presionando Ctrl + X, luego confirmar que deseas guardar los cambios presionando \\"Y\\" y finalmente presionar Enter para guardar con el mismo nombre \\"ai.py\\". 7. Ejecuta el script: En Termux, ejecuta el comando para ejecutar el script: \`\`\` python ai.py \`\`\` Estos son los pasos básicos para crear una IA simple utilizando ChatterBot en Termux.

// 停止下降，开始上升 \`\`\` 替换为： \`\`\`java claw.isDropping = false; // 停止下降，开始上升 \`\`\` 以下是修改过后的 \`checkCollisions()\` 方法代码段： \`\`\`java // 检查钩爪和垃圾的碰撞 void checkCollisions() { if (isHoldingTrash) { return; // 如果已经抓住垃圾，不再检查碰撞 } for (Trash trash : trashItems) { float d = dist(claw.x, claw.y + claw.length, trash.x, trash.y);

float radius; color col; boolean isHooked = false; float vx = 0; // X轴速度 float vy = 0; // Y轴速度 Trash(float x_, float y_, float r_, color c_) { x = x_; y = y_; radius = r_; col = c_; } void update() { x += vx;

float ny = other.y - this.y; float dist = sqrt(nx*nx + ny*ny); // 正常化法线 nx /= dist; ny /= dist; // 计算相对速度的法线分量 float relativeVelocity = (other.vx - this.vx) * nx + (other.vy - this.vy) * ny; // 碰撞后新的速度 this.vx -= relativeVelocity * nx; this.vy -= relativeVelocity * ny; // 强制分开 float overlap = (radius + other.radius) - dist; this.x -= overlap * nx * 0.5; this.y -= overlap * ny * 0.5; other.x += overlap * nx * 0.5; other.y += overlap * ny * 0.5; } } \`\`\` 接下来，更新 \`Hook\` 类的 \`update()\` 方法，在上升时检测碰撞并处理它： \`\`\`java class Hook { // ... 钩爪的其它变量 void update() { // ... 已有的摇摆和上升代码 if (isHoldingTrash && hookedTrash != null) { // 检查被钩住的垃圾碰撞到其他垃圾 for (Trash trash : trashItems) { if (trash != hookedTrash) { // 不要和自己碰撞 float d = dist(hookedTrash.x, hookedTrash.y, trash.x, trash.y); if (d < hookedTrash.radius + trash.radius) { hookedTrash.collide(trash); // 调用碰撞响应 } } } } } // ... 钩爪的其它方法 } \`\`\` 注意，我们在 \`Trash\` 类中增加了速度变量 \`vx\` 与 \`vy\`，并在碰撞之后基于完全弹性碰撞公式改变受到撞击垃圾的速度。这里假定所有的垃圾质量相等，因此在碰撞响应中没有涉及质量比的计算。 最后，更新 \`draw()\` 函数，在每一帧渲染前更新所有垃圾的位置： \`\`\`java void draw() { background(255); drawEnvironment(); // 更新垃圾位置 for (Trash trash : trashItems) { trash.update(); } for (Trash trash : trashItems) { trash.display(); } claw.update(); claw.display(); checkCollisions(); } \`\`\` 经过以上这些修改，现在当你的钩爪抓住一件垃圾并在上升时遇到其他垃圾，它们就会被弹开，模仿了完全弹性碰撞的行为。记住这是一个简化的模型，真实情况下的碰撞可能涉及更复杂的物理和数学计算。"},{"instruction":"给出修改后的完整代码，不要省略，给出中文注释","output":"以下是完全弹性碰撞效果的完整代码和中文注释： \`\`\`java ArrayList<Trash> trashItems;

float ny = other.y - this.y; float dist = sqrt(nx * nx + ny * ny); // 碰撞时，避免垃圾彼此重叠，避免除以零 if (dist < this.radius + other.radius && dist > 0) { // 正则化碰撞法线向量 nx /= dist; ny /= dist; // 计算两个垃圾在法线方向上的相对速度 float p = 2 * (vx * nx + vy * ny - other.vx * nx - other.vy * ny) / 2; // 更新速度，使它们沿法线方向分开 this.vx -= p * nx; this.vy -= p * ny; other.vx += p * nx; other.vy += p * ny; } } \`\`\` 其次，检查更新垃圾位置的 \`update()\` 方法，并确认没有给垃圾误加速度，比如只在合适的时机（比如发生碰撞时）更新速度。此外，还要确认垃圾的速度衰减逻辑是否正确实施，避免垃圾在没有受到外力影响时速度持续增加。速度衰减通常用于模拟摩擦力或空气阻力等现象，对速度进行阻尼： \`\`\`java void update() { // 在本例中，没有引力或其它持续的力，所以如果垃圾没有被钩住， // 我们只更新它的位置，并应用阻尼以模拟阻力。 if (!isHooked) { x += vx; y += vy; // 应用摩擦力或阻尼效果减缓速度。 vx *= 0.95; // 水平阻尼 vy *= 0.95; // 垂直阻尼 } } \`\`\` 此外，检查 \`draw()\` 函数中是否有正确调用更新垃圾位置的 \`update()\` 方法，确保每次画面刷新时所有垃圾都更新它们的位置。 如果垃圾在没有任何交互的情况下持续移动，请确保垃圾初始的速度 \`vx\` 和 \`vy\` 都设置为 0，并检查整个 \`update()\` 函数以确定没有在其中意外地改变速度。 如果在对上述部分进行审查之后问题仍然存在，请检查完整的代码逻辑，特别是与物理模拟相关的部分，以确保没有其他地方意外地改变了垃圾的速度。在物理模拟中，任何小的逻辑错误都可能导致出乎意料的行为。通过仔细审查和测试代码，你可以找到导致这一行为的原因并修复它。"},{"instruction":"给出修改后的完整代码，不要省略，给出中文注释","output":"以下是带中文注释的完整代码，包括碰撞处理和防止垃圾物体无缘无故移动的逻辑： \`\`\`java ArrayList<Trash> trashItems;

If the president was now a prime minister? How the three main branches, the legislative, executive and judicial branches, function?","output":"If the United States were to implement a parliamentary system instead of a congress, the government would undergo significant changes. Here's how it might look: 1. Legislative Branch: - The parliament would replace the Congress as the legislative branch. - The parliament would consist of two houses: the Lower House (such as the House of Commons) and the Upper House (such as the House of Lords). - Members of the Lower House would be elected by the people in their respective constituencies. - The Upper House members (such as senators) may be appointed, elected, or a combination of both. - The parliament would be responsible for creating, amending, and passing laws. 2. Executive Branch: - The President would be replaced by a Prime Minister as the head of government. - The Prime Minister would be elected from the majority party or coalition in the parliament. - The Prime Minister would lead the executive branch and have the power to appoint ministers from within the parliament to form a Cabinet. - The Prime Minister's role would be to implement and execute laws, make decisions, and govern the country. 3. Judicial Branch: - The judicial branch, including the Supreme Court, would remain largely unchanged. - The court system would continue to interpret and apply laws, resolve disputes, and ensure the constitutionality of legislation. - The Prime Minister and the parliament would have the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court and other courts. Key Differences: - The Prime Minister is typically a member of the parliament, whereas the President is separately elected in the current system. - The Prime Minister is beholden to the parliament and can be removed through a vote of no confidence if they lose support. - The parliament has more direct control over the executive branch, allowing for more immediate and accountable decision-making. - The separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches is less distinct in a parliamentary system, as both are intertwined. It's important to note that the specific details of a parliamentary system can vary depending on the country. This outline reflects a generalized understanding and is not an exhaustive analysis of all possible variations."},{"instruction":"In the scorching heat of a summer’s day, Rosa the Pig and Krash the Rabbit ventured to a hidden pool nestled in the heart of their enchanting village. They had heard tales of this mysterious pool - a pool not like the typical ones filled with crystal-clear water, but rather a strange pool of bubbling mud known to have unique properties. Intrigued by the stories, they set out on an adventure to experience it for themselves. As they approached the pool, a sense of wonder and anticipation filled the air. Rosa couldn’t resist the temptation and eagerly approached the warm, gooey substance. With her hooves extended, she carefully dipped a toe into the pool, feeling the strangely inviting texture. Without a second thought, Rosa took a bold step forward and found herself sinking ankle-deep in the muddy embrace. From a safe distance, Krash watched as Rosa slowly disappeared beneath the bubbling surface. Panic welled up within him, fearing that Rosa was in danger of drowning. He called out urgently, his voice filled with concern, “Rosa, are you okay? Do you need help?” Muffled by the thick mud, Rosa’s calm voice surprised Krash, alleviating some of his worry. She reassured him, “Don’t worry, Krash! This mud pool has some peculiar properties. It feels like quicksand, but fear not, I can breathe just fine.” Krash’s eyes widened in both relief and curiosity. He anxiously watched as Rosa’s entire body submerged into the mud, reminding himself to trust her reassuring words. Minutes felt like hours to Krash as he waited for any sign of Rosa’s return. He couldn’t help but wonder what exactly was happening beneath that thick layer of goo. Suddenly, a flicker of Rosa’s feet broke the surface, teasing Krash before once again vanishing under the mud. His worry intensified, unsure of what was unfolding beneath the surface. But he clung onto Rosa’s words, hoping that she was indeed safe and sound. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. Her face beamed with delight as she trotted back towards Krash, her voice filled with triumph. “Krash, you won’t believe the adventure I just had! The mud pool seemed to have different layers, and I sank until I reached a solid ground below. It was like immersing myself in a cozy mud cocoon.” Relief washed over Krash, gratitude filling his voice. “Oh, Rosa, I was so worried! I had no idea how deep that pool was or what was happening to you under the mud.” Rosa smiled warmly and explained, “I apologize for not explaining beforehand, Krash. Sometimes, it’s good to trust in the unknown and allow ourselves to experience something new. You see, the mud pool has incredible healing properties, and I decided to indulge in some therapeutic relaxation. It was an incredible journey.” Krash listened attentively, still slightly flustered but filled with curiosity. He stuttered, “B-but Rosa, I was so concerned for you! I thought something terrible had happened!” Rosa’s expression softened as she took in Krash’s genuine worry. “I understand, Krash. I should have communicated better with you before diving into the mud. I’m sorry for causing you unnecessary concern. Next time, I promise to explain everything. But for now, let’s embrace the magic of this unique pool and enjoy its healing powers together.” With a nod of understanding, Krash couldn’t help but feel a sense of excitement. The unknown was no longer as daunting as before. They had discovered a hidden gem within their village, and with Rosa by his side, Krash was ready to embrace the adventure and experience the limitless possibilities that lay ahead. I wanted you to write the first time Rosa went in it, before Krash even thought about it Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here’s the revised version: One scorching summer’s day, Rosa the Pig found herself wandering through the enchanting village she called home. The heat was unbearable, and Rosa’s usual cheerful demeanor was slowly fading into exhaustion. As she roamed the streets, Rosa heard whispers of a hidden pool nestled in the heart of the village. Rumors spread of a strange pool filled not with crystal-clear water, but with bubbling mud that possessed magical properties. Intrigued by these tales, Rosa’s curiosity got the best of her. With an adventurous spirit and a desperate need to cool off, she ventured towards the location of the pool. Following a narrow path through the thick foliage, Rosa finally reached her destination. There it lay before her, a mysterious pool of bubbling mud, its surface mirroring the bright summer sky. Without a second thought, Rosa cautiously approached the pool, her hooves sinking softly into the mud at the edge. She extended a hoof, hesitantly touching the warm, gooey substance. Curiosity took over her, and before she could think twice, Rosa carefully stepped into the pool, feeling her legs sink ankle-deep into the muddy embrace. As she stood there, the mud clinging to her hooves, Rosa became aware of an extraordinary sensation. It was as if the mud gently hugged her, offering solace from the scorching sun. A wave of tranquility washed over her, urging her to go deeper into the pool. With each step Rosa took, the mud slowly engulfed her body. Panic started to rise within her, her head barely visible above the surface. Her heart pounded, and she wondered if she had made a terrible mistake. But just as her panic reached its peak, Rosa noticed something peculiar - she could breathe freely despite being submerged in the muddy depths. She took a deep breath, realizing that she was not in any immediate danger. The mud, though seemingly dense and treacherous, had a remarkable quality about it. It was like sinking into a cozy mud cocoon, providing both a sense of security and a strange comfort. Minutes turned into hours, but Rosa lost track of time as she explored the layers of the mud pool. With each step, the thick substance seemed to cradle her, releasing any tension she had carried before. The mud’s warmth seemed to seep into her very core, invigorating her body and spirit. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. She was drenched from head to hoof, but her face wore a bright smile of exhilaration and newfound vitality. The experience had been unforgettable, transforming her weariness into a renewed sense of energy. As Rosa made her way back through the village, still covered in mud, she knew she had to share her discovery. Everyone deserved a chance to experience the rejuvenating powers of the magical mud pool. And little did Rosa know that her adventures in the mud would soon be accompanied by a concerned but curious friend named Krash the Rabbit, who would ultimately join her in exploring the depths of the enchanting oasis. From that day on, Rosa and Krash’s friendship would be forever changed as they embarked on countless adventures, discovering the wonders hidden within their captivating village. And the story of the magical mud pool would live on, retold by generations, as a testament to the enchantment that lay in the heart of their extraordinary world. Write a story where Olga the Owl stumbles upon it, and thinks she is drowning in quicksand","output":"One still summer night, when the moon shone brightly in the sky, Olga the Owl set out for a late night flight through the woods surrounding her cozy nest. As she soared gracefully through the trees, her keen eyes caught a glimmer of something peculiar in a moonlit clearing. Intrigued, Olga tilted her wings and gently landed near an inviting pool of bubbling mud. Unaware of the pool's magical properties, Olga approached the edge cautiously. The rhythmic bubbling and the thick texture of the mud reminded her of quicksand, and fear tugged at her heart. She hesitated, unsure if the pool posed any danger. As she stood hesitating on the edge, she caught a glimpse of her own reflection in the moonlit surface, and her heart skipped a beat. Olga was convinced that she was staring into her untimely demise. Panic gripped her as she supposely saw herself sinking deeper into the treacherous pool. With each imagined sinking movement, Olga flapped her wings in a frenzy, desperate to escape the imagined clutches of the mud. She let out a distressed hoot, hoping that someone nearby would come to her aid. Unbeknownst to Olga, Rosa the Pig and Krash the Rabbit had heard her distress call from their nearby adventure. Concerned for their friend, they hurried towards the clearing, arriving just in time to witness Olga's wild flapping and distressed hooting. Rosa immediately recognized the misunderstanding and quickly shouted, \\"Olga! It's not quicksand! It's a magical mud pool! You're not sinking, you're safe!\\" Krash, eager to help calm Olga's fears, chimed in, \\"Yes, Olga, Rosa's right! We've both experienced the mud pool before, and it's actually quite incredible. It won't harm you!\\" Olga, still fearful, paused her panicked flapping and listened intently to Rosa and Krash's words. She peered at them through wide eyes, wanting to trust their reassurances but still too frightened to move. Rosa slowly made her way towards Olga and gently said, \\"Olga, I understand how scary this must seem to you, but trust us. The mud pool isn't dangerous at all. In fact, it's filled with healing properties that can rejuvenate your tired wings and soothe your anxious mind.\\" Krash nodded in agreement. \\"That's right, Olga. It's a unique and magical place. Rosa and I have both been in it before, and we've emerged feeling more alive and energized than ever.\\" Olga looked back at the mud pool, the bubbling mud now seeming less intimidating. A glimmer of curiosity sparked within her, overpowering her initial fear. With cautious determination, she took a hesitant step towards the pool, testing the surface with her talons. Finding it more solid than expected, she let out a deep sigh of relief. Rosa and Krash beamed with encouragement as Olga sunk her talons deeper into the mud, feeling the strange warmth and comfort that they had once experienced. Slowly but surely, Olga could feel the fear melting away, replaced by a newfound sense of tranquility. As Olga continued to explore the mud pool, she discovered that it truly was a wondrous place. The mud cocooned around her, cradling her like a soft embrace, and the healing properties seeped into her feathers, soothing her tired wings and relieving her anxieties. When Olga eventually emerged from the mud, her feathers were adorned with remnants of its sticky embrace. But instead of distress, her eyes sparkled with awe and gratitude. She turned to Rosa and Krash, her voice filled with wonder, \\"You were right! The mud pool isn't quicksand; it's a sanctuary of healing and renewal. Thank you both for helping me overcome my fears.\\" Rosa and Krash smiled warmly, pleased to have been able to help their friend. Together, the three friends basked in the moonlight, sharing stories and laughter, knowing that they had stumbled upon something truly extraordinary.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"In the scorching heat of a summer’s day, Rosa the Pig and Krash the Rabbit ventured to a hidden pool nestled in the heart of their enchanting village. They had heard tales of this mysterious pool - a pool not like the typical ones filled with crystal-clear water, but rather a strange pool of bubbling mud known to have unique properties. Intrigued by the stories, they set out on an adventure to experience it for themselves. As they approached the pool, a sense of wonder and anticipation filled the air. Rosa couldn’t resist the temptation and eagerly approached the warm, gooey substance. With her hooves extended, she carefully dipped a toe into the pool, feeling the strangely inviting texture. Without a second thought, Rosa took a bold step forward and found herself sinking ankle-deep in the muddy embrace. From a safe distance, Krash watched as Rosa slowly disappeared beneath the bubbling surface. Panic welled up within him, fearing that Rosa was in danger of drowning. He called out urgently, his voice filled with concern, “Rosa, are you okay? Do you need help?” Muffled by the thick mud, Rosa’s calm voice surprised Krash, alleviating some of his worry. She reassured him, “Don’t worry, Krash! This mud pool has some peculiar properties. It feels like quicksand, but fear not, I can breathe just fine.” Krash’s eyes widened in both relief and curiosity. He anxiously watched as Rosa’s entire body submerged into the mud, reminding himself to trust her reassuring words. Minutes felt like hours to Krash as he waited for any sign of Rosa’s return. He couldn’t help but wonder what exactly was happening beneath that thick layer of goo. Suddenly, a flicker of Rosa’s feet broke the surface, teasing Krash before once again vanishing under the mud. His worry intensified, unsure of what was unfolding beneath the surface. But he clung onto Rosa’s words, hoping that she was indeed safe and sound. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. Her face beamed with delight as she trotted back towards Krash, her voice filled with triumph. “Krash, you won’t believe the adventure I just had! The mud pool seemed to have different layers, and I sank until I reached a solid ground below. It was like immersing myself in a cozy mud cocoon.” Relief washed over Krash, gratitude filling his voice. “Oh, Rosa, I was so worried! I had no idea how deep that pool was or what was happening to you under the mud.” Rosa smiled warmly and explained, “I apologize for not explaining beforehand, Krash. Sometimes, it’s good to trust in the unknown and allow ourselves to experience something new. You see, the mud pool has incredible healing properties, and I decided to indulge in some therapeutic relaxation. It was an incredible journey.” Krash listened attentively, still slightly flustered but filled with curiosity. He stuttered, “B-but Rosa, I was so concerned for you! I thought something terrible had happened!” Rosa’s expression softened as she took in Krash’s genuine worry. “I understand, Krash. I should have communicated better with you before diving into the mud. I’m sorry for causing you unnecessary concern. Next time, I promise to explain everything. But for now, let’s embrace the magic of this unique pool and enjoy its healing powers together.” With a nod of understanding, Krash couldn’t help but feel a sense of excitement. The unknown was no longer as daunting as before. They had discovered a hidden gem within their village, and with Rosa by his side, Krash was ready to embrace the adventure and experience the limitless possibilities that lay ahead. I wanted you to write the first time Rosa went in it, before Krash even thought about it Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here’s the revised version: One scorching summer’s day, Rosa the Pig found herself wandering through the enchanting village she called home. The heat was unbearable, and Rosa’s usual cheerful demeanor was slowly fading into exhaustion. As she roamed the streets, Rosa heard whispers of a hidden pool nestled in the heart of the village. Rumors spread of a strange pool filled not with crystal-clear water, but with bubbling mud that possessed magical properties. Intrigued by these tales, Rosa’s curiosity got the best of her. With an adventurous spirit and a desperate need to cool off, she ventured towards the location of the pool. Following a narrow path through the thick foliage, Rosa finally reached her destination. There it lay before her, a mysterious pool of bubbling mud, its surface mirroring the bright summer sky. Without a second thought, Rosa cautiously approached the pool, her hooves sinking softly into the mud at the edge. She extended a hoof, hesitantly touching the warm, gooey substance. Curiosity took over her, and before she could think twice, Rosa carefully stepped into the pool, feeling her legs sink ankle-deep into the muddy embrace. As she stood there, the mud clinging to her hooves, Rosa became aware of an extraordinary sensation. It was as if the mud gently hugged her, offering solace from the scorching sun. A wave of tranquility washed over her, urging her to go deeper into the pool. With each step Rosa took, the mud slowly engulfed her body. Panic started to rise within her, her head barely visible above the surface. Her heart pounded, and she wondered if she had made a terrible mistake. But just as her panic reached its peak, Rosa noticed something peculiar - she could breathe freely despite being submerged in the muddy depths. She took a deep breath, realizing that she was not in any immediate danger. The mud, though seemingly dense and treacherous, had a remarkable quality about it. It was like sinking into a cozy mud cocoon, providing both a sense of security and a strange comfort. Minutes turned into hours, but Rosa lost track of time as she explored the layers of the mud pool. With each step, the thick substance seemed to cradle her, releasing any tension she had carried before. The mud’s warmth seemed to seep into her very core, invigorating her body and spirit. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. She was drenched from head to hoof, but her face wore a bright smile of exhilaration and newfound vitality. The experience had been unforgettable, transforming her weariness into a renewed sense of energy. As Rosa made her way back through the village, still covered in mud, she knew she had to share her discovery. Everyone deserved a chance to experience the rejuvenating powers of the magical mud pool. And little did Rosa know that her adventures in the mud would soon be accompanied by a concerned but curious friend named Krash the Rabbit, who would ultimately join her in exploring the depths of the enchanting oasis. From that day on, Rosa and Krash’s friendship would be forever changed as they embarked on countless adventures, discovering the wonders hidden within their captivating village. And the story of the magical mud pool would live on, retold by generations, as a testament to the enchantment that lay in the heart of their extraordinary world.

There, he found a hidden pool filled not with water, but with bubbling mud. With a mix of trepidation and excitement, Finn approached the pool cautiously. As he took his first step forward, his entire body instantly sank into the mud, surprising him. Panic filled his eyes as he struggled to find solid ground, fearing that he might never resurface. To his astonishment, he soon realized that he could breathe just fine, even though he was completely submerged in the muddy depths. With his heart racing, Finn took a deep breath, reassured by this unexpected discovery. Just as he was coming to terms with the situation, he noticed someone approaching the pool. With each step, Finn's heart skipped a beat, but it was Rosa the Pig, a friendly face he had seen around the village. She had also been drawn to the rumor, eager to experience the wonders of the strange mud pool herself. Without hesitation, Rosa stepped into the pool, disappearing beneath the surface.

Listening to Rosa's account, Finn's eyes sparkled with curiosity. He longed to immerse himself in the mud pool, to feel the unknown beneath the surface. But his mischievous nature gave way to hesitation. He was unsure if he could trust the mud, even with Rosa's reassurances. Rosa sensed Finn's inner battle and understood his reservations. With a warm smile, she gently reassured him, \\"Finn, I know it seems scary, but the mud pool holds incredible healing powers. You can trust it, just as you trusted me. Come, let's experience this magic together.\\" Finn hesitated for a moment, but Rosa's gentle encouragement melted his worries away. Slowly, he took a step forward, feeling the mud envelop his paws. It was an odd sensation, both unfamiliar and strangely comforting. As he sank deeper into the mud, Finn's heart raced, but with each passing moment, the fear subsided. Just like Rosa, he discovered that he could breathe freely, and a sense of calm washed over him. Beneath the muddy surface, Finn and Rosa met, their eyes gleaming with excitement and wonder. They marveled at the layers of mud, the way it seemed to caress their bodies, and the peaceful stillness that surrounded them.

It was a place where memories of laughter and joy once thrived, now consumed by layers of dust and cobwebs. Krash the Rabbit, being an inquisitive and adventurous spirit, couldn't resist the urge to explore this forgotten relic. As he pushed open the creaky doors, the musty air and eerie silence surrounded him. The sight that greeted him was unexpected yet captivating. In the center of the vast hall stood a peculiar Christmas tree, formed entirely out of old and worn-out television sets. Their various sizes and retro designs created a colorful and nostalgic centerpiece that illuminated the dim surroundings. Krash couldn't help but marvel at the unexpected beauty before him.

Who had created such an extraordinary display? Why had it been left untouched in this abandoned gym hall? Curiosity burned within him, urging him to unveil the story behind this unique Christmas creation. As Krash gently touched one of the television sets, a wave of nostalgia washed over him. The sounds of laughter, the smell of freshly baked cookies, and the joyful anticipation that filled the air during Christmas came flooding back.

Assign different ranges of dice rolls for spells and assign how many points of damage or what effect spells do. The higher level the spell is, the higher its dice roll range should be. At the start of the duel, though, Lily casts on me a spell that makes me regress in age by 1 year every time I cast a spell. for every year that I regress, a -1 penalty is added to my roll.

Give Lily the option to further my regression by 2 per turn instead of casting a spell. Establish a health bar for both Lily and me. We both start with 100 health points. Do Lily’s turn after mine.
