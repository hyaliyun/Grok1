It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

The Seahawks took the lead on an early field goal, but momentum quickly shifted to the hometown Bears.

Any hopes for a comeback were erased after the Bears scored a touchdown on their first possession of the second half for a 276 lead. The Seahawks running attack was diminished without the injured Shaun Alexander. Near constant pressure on Hasselbeck, including 5 sacks, thwarted the effectiveness of the 4 receiver offense that had confused the Giants the week before.

The court found Robert Munro of Foulis in favour and instructed Alexander Chisholm to produce Valentine Chisholm, who was known for his barbarity, and his four followers in court within fifteen days, compensate Foulis and his kinsmen for their losses and also to provide a £1,000 bond as security for future good behaviour.

Reid, who retired in 2017, expressed an eagerness to \\"work together\\" with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \\"I am ready to work with Senator McConnell,\\" Reid stated. \\"We may come from different parties and different backgrounds, but we share a love for this country, and a commitment to making it a better place for all Americans. I believe that by working together, we can achieve great things for our nation.\\" Reid's visit to the Senate floor came at a time when tensions between Democrats and Republicans are high, with the ongoing government shutdown and negotiations over border security dominating the news cycle. Many Democrats have criticized McConnell's handling of the situation, accusing him of not doing enough to end the shutdown. Despite the criticism, Reid's comments suggest that he is willing to give McConnell the benefit of the doubt, and work together to find a solution to the current stalemate. The two lawmakers have a history of working together, having previously collaborated on legislation relating to immigration and taxes. Reid's return to the Senate floor was also significant because of his previous involvement in the fight against President Trump's agenda. As Senate Minority Leader, Reid played a key role in opposing the Trump administration, and his absence from the Senate floor was felt by many Democrats. Overall, Reid's appearance on the Senate floor was a welcome reminder of the importance of bipartisanship and cooperation in the current political climate. With so much at stake for the American people, it is essential that lawmakers from both parties put aside their differences and work together to find solutions that benefit everyone. Whether or not Reid's call for unity is heeded remains to be seen, but his message is one that is worth remembering as we move forward."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Go to the video you want to download.

Currently, it holds almost a quarter of the limited fishing permits allocated to the country by the European Union. However, the fishing giant's ownership is not British. As per European rules, foreign-owned boats, including the Cornelis Vrolijk, are allowed to access the UK quota. The vessel is owned by the Vrolijk, a Dutch firm, and operates primarily in the English Channel and the North Sea. Cornelis Vrolijk is just one example of how foreign fishing businesses hold a significant percentage of England's fishing quota. According to reports, a staggering 43% of England's fishing quota is owned by such companies. This issue has been a bone of contention in the Brexit negotiations. Fishing has emerged as a crucial sticking point, with the UK government insisting that Britain would have full control of its waters post-Brexit. Simultaneously, the European Union has made it clear that its fishing fleets need to access UK waters, considering they have traditionally fished in the area. In summary, whilst Cornelis Vrolijk and other foreign-owned giant trawlers play a crucial role in England's fishing industry, the ownership structure raises some questions.

However, parent club Chelsea has made it clear that they want assurances that the 29-year-old will receive regular game time in the top flight of English football. The Toffees' manager Roberto Martinez, however, is said to be hesitant to provide any guarantees regarding Atsu's playing time. This stance has put the loan deal in doubt, with Chelsea wanting to ensure that their player gets enough minutes on the pitch to continue his development. Atsu has been with Chelsea since 2013 but has spent most of his time out on loan at various clubs including Vitesse, Everton, AFC Bournemouth, and Newcastle United. Last season, Atsu spent time on loan again at Newcastle United. He made 20 Premier League appearances for the Magpies, scoring two goals and providing one assist. With Everton keen to add firepower to their attacking lineup, Atsu could be seen as a valuable addition to the team if he can secure regular game time. However, Martinez's reluctance to make any guarantees leaves the potential move up in the air. It remains to be seen if the two clubs can come to an agreement. Everton's pursuit of Atsu is one that could be beneficial to all parties, but it ultimately depends on whether Chelsea is willing to take the risk of letting their player go out on loan again without any guarantees about playing time."},{"instruction":"A man in a red jacket holds his bike for the picture.

In 2009, a 57 kW solar power plant was installed, the largest in the Pacific at the time, including New Zealand. It is estimated that 330 kW of solar and 450 kW of wind power would be required to make the College of the Marshall Islands energy selfsufficient.

This means that only a small percentage of the country's workforce belongs to trade unions, which are organizations that represent workers in negotiations with employers to secure better working conditions, wages, and benefits. The low unionization rate in Paraguay can be attributed to various factors, including weak legal protections for workers' rights, government hostility towards unions, and the prevalence of sub-contracting and informal work arrangements that make union organizing difficult. Additionally, some workers may be hesitant to join unions out of fear of reprisals from employers or concern that membership fees will further stretch their already limited financial resources. Despite these challenges, there are indications of a growing interest in unionization among some sectors of the workforce in Paraguay, particularly among agricultural laborers and informal workers. Unions in these sectors have been successful in securing small but significant gains for their members, such as increases in the minimum wage and improvements in working conditions. Overall, the low rate of unionization in Paraguay is a cause for concern, as it suggests that many workers are not able to effectively advocate for their rights and interests in the workplace. Efforts to strengthen legal protections for workers and support union organizing efforts could help to address this issue and ensure that workers in Paraguay have a greater say in shaping their working conditions and future."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence.

Sales of DVDs priced at £4.24 rocketed when a sign said 'Two for £10' When shop launched BOGOF teabag box deal, 45% picked up just one box. We are influenced by product promotions but don't take in the details.","output":"The power of sub-consciousness is evident when it comes to making purchasing decisions. With so many offers and promotions around us, it is easy to get influenced without even realizing it. Consumers tend to make quick, impulsive decisions based on what appeals to them at a subconscious level. One of the classic examples of this phenomenon involves sales of DVDs priced at £4.24. The sales skyrocketed when a sign advertised a 'Two for £10' offer. This simple offer tapped into the subconscious mind of consumers, who saw it as a good deal without really taking notice of the initial sticker price. Similarly, when a shop launched a BOGOF (buy one get one free) teabag box deal, as many as 45% of consumers picked up just one box. Again, the subconscious mind played a major role in influencing purchase decisions. Consumers were drawn to the idea of getting something for free, and this overpowered their rational thinking. They failed to consider the fact that they were not getting the best value for their money by purchasing just one box. The fact is that product promotions have a significant impact on consumer behavior, even though many of us fail to take in the details of these offers. Companies know this, and they use it to their benefit by designing promotions that appeal to our subconscious minds. From flashy advertisements to attractive packaging, every aspect of marketing is designed to influence us at a subconscious level. The problem with this approach is that consumers often end up making decisions that are not in their best interest. They may end up spending more money than they intended, or buying products that they don't really need. To avoid falling into this trap, it is essential for consumers to be aware of their subconscious biases and to take a more rational approach to making purchasing decisions. In conclusion, the sub-conscious mind plays a key role in shaping our purchasing decisions. We are influenced by product promotions at a subconscious level, but we must also learn to pay attention to the details and make rational choices. By doing so, we can avoid getting swayed by offers that may not be the best value for our money."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Yes, I can!

However, there are several techniques we can use to help alleviate stress and anxiety. Positive self-talk is an excellent way to shift negative thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations. Instead of focusing on the things we can’t control, try to focus on the things we can. Another technique is to create a coping skills box. This can include items that make us feel happy, calm, and relaxed. It can be anything from a favorite book, a stress ball or a scented candle. Talking to trusted loved ones can also provide a sense of relief. Having a support system in place can help us cope with stressful situations. Additionally, writing down our feelings can be therapeutic. Putting our emotions on paper can help us gain perspective and process our emotions. The five senses technique is also an effective self-soothing practice. The next time you feel overwhelmed or anxious, try focusing on each of your senses. Take a deep breath and focus on what you see, hear, smell, taste and feel. Meditation and prayer can help to calm the mind and reduce stress levels. These practices promote relaxation and can help us gain a greater sense of peace and clarity. Breathing exercises are another technique that can provide almost instant relief. Whenever we feel stressed, we tend to take shallow breaths. Taking slow, deep breaths can help to slow down our heart rate and relax our muscles. Using visual imagery to create an imaginary “safe place” is also an effective technique. Imagine a place where you feel safe and relaxed.

This condition can severely restrict blood flow to vital organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, which can result in serious health problems such as heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure. Understanding the role of atherosclerosis is essential for maintaining good cardiovascular health. Another condition that individuals should be aware of is fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). FMD is a rare disorder that causes abnormal growth or narrowing of arteries, primarily in the renal, carotid, and vertebral arteries. Although the exact causes of FMD are not fully understood, hormones, environmental factors, and genetic predisposition may all play a role. Individuals with FMD are at an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, aneurysms, and other cardiovascular problems. Demographic risk factors can also play a significant role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. For example, individuals who are older, male, or from certain ethnic groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, are at a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis and related conditions. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as smoking, poor diet, and inactivity can significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Finally, paying attention to your health history is crucial for identifying and managing cardiovascular disease risk factors. If you have a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or stroke, you may be at a higher risk of developing these conditions. Similarly, if you have previously been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, it is essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage these conditions and reduce your risk of developing further complications. In conclusion, understanding the role of atherosclerosis and the risks associated with other cardiovascular conditions such as FMD is critical for maintaining good health. By paying attention to demographic risk factors and your health history, you can take steps to manage or reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease and live a happier, healthier life."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[›] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered nullhomotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole).

Apple was 'almost a religion' says founder.","output":"Graphisoft, a Hungarian company, was founded in the year 1980 by a group of computer enthusiasts with the aim of creating software for architects. The firm went on to develop ArchiCAD – a ground breaking software that enabled architects to create, share, and manage 3D models of buildings. However, the fledgling company was facing financial difficulties, which is when Apple founder Steve Jobs stepped in to help. In the early 1980s, Hungary was under communist rule and the economy was in a state of stagnation. Due to the nature of the communist system, private enterprise was discouraged and the government had a stranglehold on industry. Against this backdrop, Graphisoft was struggling to get off the ground, until they received a lifeline from Jobs. Jobs was impressed with the ability of the ArchiCAD software and saw the potential for it in the architectural industry. He not only invested additional funds to help Graphisoft financially but also provided them with computers which allowed the company's developers to create a Macintosh version of ArchiCAD. With Jobs' support, Graphisoft's software became an instant hit, and revolutionized the way architects designed buildings. In a recent interview, Jobs spoke of his admiration for the Graphisoft team and their software. \\"Architects love ArchiCAD,\\" he said, \\"It's almost a religion for them.\\" Jobs acknowledged the remarkable achievements of the underdog Hungarian team in creating such a revolutionary product in a period of political turmoil. Today, Graphisoft is a world leader in architectural software with its ArchiCAD software being used by architects and designers worldwide. The company's success story serves as a reminder of the power of innovation, perseverance, and collaboration. The role played by Jobs in the success story of Graphisoft further highlights his unwavering passion for innovation and his willingness to help a fellow entrepreneur in need."},{"instruction":"THE company behind animated hits such as Shark Tale and Shrek has made initial moves towards a public offering which could be worth up to US700m (960m).

Each bar has its own unique atmosphere and specialty, so understanding the differences can help ensure that you have a great time. Firstly, it's crucial to distinguish between a restaurant bar and other types of bars. A restaurant bar primarily exists to serve food and drinks to patrons who are dining in the restaurant. The emphasis is on the food, and the bar is typically a secondary feature. On the other hand, bars that focus on drinks rather than food tend to have a different vibe altogether. One type of bar that is growing in popularity is the beer bar. These bars specialize in serving a wide selection of beers ranging from local craft brews to international favorites. They often have a casual vibe and are a great spot to catch up with friends or watch a game. Wine bars, on the other hand, tend to have a more sophisticated atmosphere. They typically offer an extensive wine list and often have a menu pairing suggestions to complement the wine. These bars are great for a more upscale night out or a special occasion. Finally, cocktail bars are a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy a more refined drinking experience. These bars specialize in creating handcrafted cocktails featuring high-quality spirits and unique ingredients. The atmosphere is often intimate and upscale, and the bartenders are highly skilled in the art of mixology. In conclusion, knowing the type of bar you're in can help you to better appreciate the experience.

One of the biggest changes that can happen for girls is the onset of their period. It is important to know that this can happen anytime between the ages of 9 to 16 and that each person's experience will be different. One of the signs that your body is getting ready to menstruate is that your breasts will start to grow. This usually happens a few years before your period starts and is a normal part of breast development. You may feel some tenderness or discomfort as they grow, but this is also normal. It's important to start wearing a bra that fits comfortably to support your growing breasts. Another sign that your period is coming is the growth of pubic hair. This hair will start to grow in the pubic area and eventually spread to the inner thighs. This hair helps to protect the genital area and is another indicator that your body is changing and preparing for menstruation. It's important to note that menstruation is a normal bodily function and should not be stigmatized or shamed. It's important to talk to a trusted adult or healthcare provider to learn more about the menstrual cycle and how to take care of yourself during your period. In conclusion, be aware that your period can start anytime between ages 9 to 16 and that breast growth and pubic hair growth are signs that it may be on the way.

Despite the Qara Khitai's military strength and advanced technology, they were no match for the Mongol Empire's battle tactics and superior military force. The Mongols used a combination of guerrilla warfare and military might to defeat the Qara Khitai. The conquest of the Qara Khitai was a significant event in the history of the Mongol Empire. It solidified the empire's control over Central Asia and paved the way for further expansion into Europe and the Middle East. The Mongol Empire's conquest of the Qara Khitai also had far-reaching consequences for the region's culture and economy, as the Mongols replaced traditional trading networks with their own system. In conclusion, the Mongol Empire's conquest of the Qara Khitai lasted for two years, from 1216 to 1218 AD. This conquest was a crucial moment in the history of the Mongol Empire and played a significant role in the empire's expansionist policy. The conquest also had far-reaching consequences for the region's culture and economy, and its impact still resonates today."},{"instruction":"Article: Mix this until it's well combined and blended together.

Batticaloa was captured by the Dutch in 1638, while Colombo was captured three years later in 1641. The Dutch were one of the European powers who arrived in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) in the 17th century with the intention of establishing a trading post. Initially, they were granted permission by the local King to set up a base in the city of Galle, and soon they began to expand their control over other parts of the island. In 1638, the Dutch set their sights on Batticaloa, a city on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The Portuguese had controlled the city earlier, but it had been taken over by the King of Kandy. The Dutch launched an attack and after a brief siege, were able to capture the city. This was a significant victory for the Dutch as Batticaloa was a key trading center and its capture allowed them to access resources from the east coast. Three years later, in 1641, the Dutch turned their attention to the city of Colombo, which was then ruled by the Portuguese. The Dutch launched a massive attack, and after a five-month siege, the Portuguese finally surrendered. Colombo was a significant stronghold for the Portuguese, and its capture gave the Dutch control over much of the western coast of Sri Lanka. In conclusion, the Dutch capture of Batticaloa happened first in 1638, followed by the capture of Colombo in 1641. These events were significant in the history of Sri Lanka as they marked the decline of Portuguese influence in the region and the rise of Dutch power."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: The Waterman eatType pub; The Waterman food Chinese; The Waterman customer rating low; The Waterman area riverside","output":"The Waterman, a pub situated in the picturesque riverside area, serves Chinese cuisine but unfortunately receives a low customer rating for its food."},{"instruction":"Georges Merle died in 1881 in Paris .

The stadiums chosen were located in different parts of the world, and they are not only considered to be aesthetically unappealing but also lack functionality. Among the list were stadiums from different parts of the world, including Britain and Bangkok. One such stadium that made the list was the Olympic Stadium in London, which was built for the 2012 Olympics. Although the venue was praised for its engineering prowess and state-of-the-art facilities, the aesthetics of the stadium did not impress many. Additionally, the National Stadium of Cambodia, located in Phnom Penh, was another stadium on the list. The stadium, also known as the \\"Dragon Stadium,\\" was constructed in 1963 and saw its heyday during the 60s and 70s. However, due to years of neglect and disrepair, the stadium has become a symbol of the city's decline. While the list encompasses many of the world's most controversial arenas and stadiums, there are undoubtedly more that were omitted from the list. For instance, the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a well-renowned stadium, but it has struggled with ongoing maintenance issues, resulting in various problems such as power cuts, access control problems, and pet infestations. Ultimately, though the list may be subjective, one cannot deny the poor aesthetics or infrastructural design that some of these stadiums possess. It's disappointing to see such iconic locations go so poorly utilized, and many would hope that these locations receive the refurbishments necessary to improve their function and appearance in the future."},{"instruction":"WewillnotifyyouincaseyoubecomeaUnitedKingdomNationalLotterywinner.

Partly due to inefficient generation of electricity in the USSR (only 20.8% thermal efficiency in 1950 vs. 36.2% in 1975), in 1950 diesel traction was about twice as energy efficient as electric traction (in terms of net tonnekm of freight per kg of fuel). But as efficiency of electricity generation (and thus of electric traction) improved, by about 1965 electric railways became more efficient than diesel. After the mid 1970s electrics used about 25% less fuel per tonkm. However diesels were mainly used on single track lines with a fair amount of traffic so that the lower fuel consumption of electrics may be in part due to better operating conditions on electrified lines (such as double tracking) rather than inherent energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the cost of diesel fuel was about 1.5 times more (per unit of heat energy content) than that of the fuel used in electric power plants (that generated electricity), thus making electric railways even more energycost effective.

It's important to consider your specific needs and interests to find a watercraft that suits you best. If you're an angler, a flat boat, bay, or bass-style boat may be the best option for you. These types of boats are designed with fishing in mind, typically featuring a wide and stable platform for casting and reeling in fish. They often have storage compartments for fishing gear and live wells to keep your catch fresh. For those seeking a more leisurely time on the water, a pontoon boat is a great choice. With its spacious deck and comfortable seating, it is perfect for relaxing and socializing with friends and family. Pontoon boats are also excellent for hosting parties or picnics, as they have ample space to accommodate guests and supplies. If you're an adventure seeker looking to navigate the open ocean, consider a cabin cruiser, cuddy cabin, or dinghy. These boats are built for ocean cruising and provide comfortable accommodations for extended stays on the water. A cabin cruiser is a larger vessel with a cabin for sleeping and cooking, while a cuddy cabin has a smaller cabin for shelter and storage. A dinghy is a smaller, more lightweight craft designed for short trips and exploring. Finally, if you love water sports, a bowrider or towboat is your best bet.

Many senior doctors have expressed their apprehension about the potential implications of a change in law that would allow for assisted suicide. One of the most pressing concerns is that such a change would put undue pressure on the elderly. There is a fear that many elderly people, who already struggle with feelings of being a burden on their families, might view assisted suicide as a way to alleviate that burden. This could lead to situations where individuals feel compelled to end their lives prematurely. These concerns are not new. The British Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians, and Royal College of GPs have all opposed assisted suicide. Polls also suggest that a majority of doctors in the UK share this view. The current legal framework, which imposes a blanket ban on assisted suicide, has been put in place precisely to prevent such situations from arising. However, advocates of assisted suicide argue that the current legal framework is too restrictive and denies individuals the right to choose how they want to end their lives. They argue that those suffering from terminal illnesses or chronic pain should be allowed to die with dignity, and that assisted suicide could provide a humane way to achieve this. Regardless of one's position on this issue, it is clear that any change in the law would have far-reaching consequences. It would be vital to ensure that such a change is introduced with safeguards in place to prevent abuse and to protect vulnerable individuals who might feel pressured into ending their lives. In the meantime, it is important for healthcare professionals to continue to provide compassionate end-of-life care and support to their patients. This includes palliative care, which can help patients manage pain and other symptoms and improve their quality of life in their final days.

Potential enemies are copying American technique to advance in space. US dependency on satellite intelligence has made them vulnerable, he said. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In a recent address, General William Shelton has emphasized the importance of being prepared for a potential space war. He warns that potential enemies are quickly advancing in space technology and are copying American techniques. This has made the US vulnerable and heavily dependent on satellite intelligence. While the US has been a leader in space technology for quite some time, other countries are quickly closing the gap. According to General Shelton, potential enemies are investing heavily in space technology and are becoming more sophisticated in their approach. As a result, America's dominance in space may be in jeopardy. One of the biggest concerns is the US dependency on satellite intelligence. The military relies heavily on satellite technology for everything from navigation to communication. In the event of an attack on the US satellite network, the military would be greatly impacted. The loss of satellite technology would compromise not only military operations, but also commercial and civilian activities. General Shelton's call to action is not without precedent. In the past, other military leaders have also expressed their concerns about the potential space war. However, the current geopolitical climate and the rapid advancement of space technology have made his warnings more urgent. In conclusion, General Shelton's call for preparedness for a potential space war should not be ignored. The US must remain vigilant and proactive in its approach to space technology. This means investing in new technology, creating better defenses, and strengthening relationships with our allies. Failure to act may leave the US vulnerable and at a significant disadvantage in the event of a space war."},{"instruction":"Do these mean the same?

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. By the late 1990s, blue LEDs became widely available. They have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber. Aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If unalloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device will emit nearultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365 nm.
