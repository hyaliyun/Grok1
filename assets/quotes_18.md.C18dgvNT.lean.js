Community groups like parent-teacher associations or neighborhood associations can provide a sense of belonging and support as well.

Talking with them openly and honestly about what's going on can help them feel heard and validated.

Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and bending your knees slightly to lower your center of gravity. Protecting your face is also essential, so keep your hands up with your fists near your temples. To prepare for a kick, lift your right leg up with your knee bent and your foot pointing towards your opponent. As you kick, you should expect your opponent to move backward, which may cause them to lose their balance and fall. This technique can provide an advantage in a combat situation and allow you to immobilize or take down your opponent. However, it's important to note that proper execution of a kick requires practice and patience. You should also be aware of the risks involved, such as leaving yourself open to counter-attacks if your opponent anticipates your move. In addition, kicking should only be used as a last resort in self-defense situations, and it's always best to avoid confrontation and seek help from authorities if possible. Ultimately, mastering fundamental stance techniques and kick moves can provide a significant advantage in martial arts and self-defense.

Osru used fake invoiced and credit card claims to buy jewellery, pay for travel and pay off her mortgage. Lawyer claims her motivation changed when she found out her daughter had a lifelong illness and used the money to buy worldfirst medicine.","output":"Dr. Esra Ogru, a former medical practitioner, was accused of embezzling almost 6 million dollars nine years ago. An investigation conducted by the authorities revealed that Ogru had been siphoning money from her employer by submitting invoices and credit card claims for expenses that never happened. She used the stolen funds to buy jewelry, pay for travel, and pay off her mortgage. However, Ogru's lawyer recently claimed that her motivation for embezzlement had changed when she found out that her daughter had been diagnosed with a life-long illness. According to her lawyer, Ogru used the money to purchase world-first medicine that was not available through regular channels. While it is understandable that a parent would go to great lengths to seek treatment for a sick child, it should not be used as an excuse for criminal activity. Ogru had a duty to adhere to the law and be respectful of the trust placed in her position as a medical professional. The ramifications of embezzlement go far beyond the financial implications. It undermines the trust essential in professional relationships and can be detrimental to the reputation of a company, affecting the livelihood of employees and their dependents. It is commendable that Ogru was determined to find a cure for her daughter's illness, but the ends cannot justify the means. As a professional, she should have been transparent about her challenges and sought support, as opposed to breaking the law. In conclusion, Dr. Esra Ogru's case is an unfortunate reminder of the impact of embezzlement. It is up to individuals, especially those within professions that handle money and sensitive information, to prioritize honesty and integrity. The legal system will hopefully ensure that justice is served and that Ogru's case will serve as a warning for others who may be tempted to engage in similar activity."},{"instruction":"@nstweets How are your exams going anyway?

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.

Bronze artifacts from the Vinča culture date to 4500 BC. Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC.

The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period (copperstone), with copper tools being used with stone tools.

Their plan to redefine fulltime employment as 40 hours a week would hurt Americans.","output":"With the GOP now in control of Congress, they are proposing a number of reforms to the current health law. However, one such reform that they are proposing would have a detrimental effect on the American public. This is their plan to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week. Currently, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, an employer must provide health insurance to workers who work more than 30 hours a week. This provision was put in place to ensure that every American has access to affordable healthcare, regardless of their employment status. However, the GOP's proposal to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week would essentially remove this provision from the ACA. This proposed reform would harm millions of Americans who currently rely on their employer for health insurance. For those who work between 30 and 40 hours a week, they would no longer be eligible for health insurance through their employer. This could leave them without access to affordable healthcare, making it difficult for them to take care of themselves and their families. Furthermore, this proposed reform would also hurt small businesses. Many small businesses are already struggling to provide health insurance to their employees due to the high costs associated with it. If the definition of full-time employment is changed to 40 hours a week, many of these small businesses would be forced to cut employee hours to avoid having to provide them with health insurance. This could result in a loss of income for these employees, making it difficult for them to make ends meet. In conclusion, the GOP's proposal to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week would have a negative impact on millions of Americans. It would leave many without access to affordable healthcare and would hurt small businesses that are already struggling to provide healthcare to their employees. It is important that we continue to fight for affordable healthcare for all Americans and prevent harmful reforms such as this from being implemented."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that about [Indian Air Force AIRCRAFT_HELICOPTER HAL Light Combat Helicopter; Agra Airport LOCATION Uttar Pradesh; Uttar Pradesh IS_PART_OF Awadh; Uttar Pradesh LEADER_NAME Ram Naik; Agra Airport OPERATING_ORGANISATION Indian Air Force].","output":"The HAL Light Combat Helicopter of the Indian Air Force operates from Agra Airport in Uttar Pradesh, which is a part of Awadh and governed by Ram Naik."},{"instruction":"What concepts are described in the following sentence?

For example, in 1919, the Missouri legislature adopted a statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail.

During the years of 2011-15, the poverty rate for families in the United States was 9.8 percent. In comparison, the poverty rate for those aged 65 or older was 9.7 percent. While these statistics suggest that the difference is quite small, it is worth noting that the overall number of families living below the poverty line is significantly greater than the number of older individuals in the same situation. According to the same census data, there were approximately 4.4 million families who were living below the poverty line during this same period. In contrast, there were an estimated 4.2 million individuals aged 65 or older who were living in poverty. It's important to note that poverty affects both of these groups in different ways. For example, older adults living in poverty may have more difficulty accessing healthcare and may require more assistance with daily activities. Families living in poverty may also experience a wide range of challenges, such as finding affordable and adequate housing, accessing quality education and healthcare, and providing basic necessities for their children. Regardless of the specific challenges that each group faces, it's clear that poverty is a significant issue in the United States that affects people of all ages. Building a stronger social safety net, providing access to affordable healthcare and education, and investing in job creation and training programs are just a few of the steps that can be taken to help lift families and individuals out of poverty and promote greater economic opportunity for all."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: the water flow is approx. 2,000 litres per hour.","output":"The water flow is approx. 2,000 litres per hour."},{"instruction":"Do these mean the same?

Her parents decided she was not ready for school emotionally or physically. They followed new guidance that says daughter can start a year later. Government says: 'No barriers to admitting child of five to reception class' But council has said Olivia she must go straight in to Year 1 instead. The ruling means the fouryearold will miss a whole year of school. 250,000 other children may also be forced to miss a year of schooling.","output":"Olivia Dutton, a four-year-old girl who only just turned four a few weeks before the start of the school year, was deemed by her parents as not ready for school emotionally or physically. Her parents followed new guidance that says their daughter can start a year later, and the government confirms that there are no barriers to admitting a child of five to the reception class. However, despite this, the council has said that Olivia must go straight into Year 1 instead of reception, which means that she will miss a whole year of school. This ruling has significant implications not only for Olivia but also for approximately 250,000 other children who may be forced to miss a year of schooling. Missing a year of school can result in many challenges, including difficulty catching up on missed lessons, a lack of socialization with children their own age, and most importantly, delayed educational and emotional development. Parents and experts argue that the child should be allowed to start in reception for a smoother transition into schooling, and it is unfair to force them to skip a year. It is vital for every child to start school with confidence and ease, which can only happen if they are developmentally ready. It is crucial for schools and councils to consider each child's individual needs and abilities rather than making blanket decisions that can have negative consequences. Children's development occurs at different rates, and it is essential to acknowledge and respect that. Ultimately, decisions regarding a child's education should be made with the child's best interests in mind, which means allowing them to start school at a time when they are emotionally and physically ready. In conclusion, the ruling forcing Olivia Dutton to start in Year 1 instead of reception highlights the importance of recognizing each child's individual needs and respecting their development. Forcing children to skip a year of school can have a detrimental impact on their educational and emotional well-being. It is crucial to follow new guidance that says children can start later, and furthermore, schools and councils must consider each child's needs to provide the best possible start to their academic journey."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to: To heat food more evenly in the microwave, OPTIONS: cover the food with another plate to seal in the heat while cooking. spread the food around the edges of the plate when microwaving.","output":"Spread the food around the edges of the plate when microwaving."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: negative","output":"Just had the worst customer service experience at the local coffee shop. #dissatisfied"},{"instruction":"To clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides.

From films to TV shows to podcasts, these mediums have just as much to offer as books, if not more. For book clubs particularly, it can be beneficial to suggest exploring media beyond books. While the shared experience of reading a book and discussing it can be rewarding, branching out into different forms of media can enhance the discussion and provide fresh perspectives. One suggestion for book clubs is to listen to an audiobook together, such as Les Misérables by Victor Hugo. With over 60 hours of content, this classic novel may seem daunting to read, but the audiobook provides a more accessible option. Plus, experiencing the story through narration can bring new life to the characters and setting, making for a more immersive experience. It is also important to take your time with consuming media. When it comes to Les Misérables, the story is best savored slowly rather than rushing through it. This allows for a deeper understanding of the themes and characters, leading to more rich discussion among book club members.

Separate birds that don't get along.","output":"When it comes to owning multiple cockatiels, it's essential to consider their compatibility before housing them together in a single cage. Putting birds together in the same cage only makes sense if they get along with each other. However, suppose your cockatiels display aggression or territorial behavior towards one another. In that case, it's vital to keep them in separate cages permanently. Cockatiels are social birds that require interaction with their flock to thrive. They love to preen each other, share food, play together, and cuddle. When they get along, housing them together in a single cage can be an excellent way to keep them entertained and happy. It's crucial to provide them with ample space to move around, climb, and play, as overcrowding can lead to territorial disputes and even injuries. On the other hand, some cockatiels don't share a friendly relationship with their peers. In such cases, it's essential to pay attention to their body language, vocalizations, and behavior towards each other. Aggressive behavior such as excessive screeching, biting, and chasing are signs that the birds don't get along. It's best to separate such birds to prevent injuries and unnecessary stress. Even if your cockatiels get along, you must monitor their behavior regularly. Birds can turn aggressive towards each other as they grow, change their mood, or during breeding season. Providing separate cages for your cockatiels is a great way to prevent such issues. Letting your incompatible cockatiels interact with each other can lead to serious health problems for both birds. Fighting can lead to severe injuries, and stressed birds are more susceptible to illnesses. By providing separate cages, you can ensure that your birds are healthy, comfortable, and happy. In conclusion, putting cockatiels together in the same cage only makes sense if they get along. If your birds display aggression or territorial behavior, it's best to keep them in separate cages permanently. Not only does it prevent injuries and illnesses, but it also ensures the happiness and well-being of your cockatiels."},{"instruction":"Premise: The Attorney General has certified that the interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it only affects the federal government operations regarding examination, detention, and removal of aliens from the United States.

Most metals and alloys can be work hardened by creating defects in their crystal structure. These defects are created during plastic deformation, such as hammering or bending, and are permanent unless the metal is recrystallized. However, some alloys can also have their properties altered by heat treatment. Nearly all metals can be softened by annealing, which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of aluminium, copper, magnesium, titanium, and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree that steel does. |Creating defects in what softens a metal?

However, it is critical that such feedback is constructive and delivered in such a way that it does not overwhelm the recipient. While well-intentioned, piling on too much feedback at once can be counterproductive and lead to resentment or confusion. To avoid overloading a coworker with feedback, it's important to choose your words carefully and prioritize the most important points. It may also be helpful to break the feedback down into smaller, manageable pieces that can be addressed over time. Giving your coworker time to change is essential, and acknowledging the effort they make is a great way to ensure that they continue to move forward. It is equally important to avoid making assumptions about your coworker when providing feedback. Focus on the specific behavior or issue at hand, rather than making assumptions about their motivations or intentions. When feedback is framed in this way, it becomes more objective and easier to incorporate into future behavior. In summary, providing constructive feedback to colleagues is an essential part of most professional environments.

Get proper licenses and permits. Follow all IRS rules. Determine your business name. Choose whether to run your business out of your home.","output":"Starting a business can be overwhelming, but having a clear plan can help make the process easier. The first step is to determine your target market. Understanding who your customers are and their needs will help you tailor your products and marketing efforts. Next, decide whether franchising is an option. If you want to use an established brand and business model, franchising could be a good choice. However, it can also come with high costs and lack of control over your business. Make sure you obtain all the necessary licenses and permits for your business. This will vary depending on your industry and location. It’s important to do your research and ensure you’re following all legal requirements. Following IRS rules is also crucial. Keep accurate records of your business’s finances and taxes. Seek professional advice from an accountant or tax specialist if needed. Determine your business name and register it with the appropriate agencies. A strong and memorable name can help with branding and marketing efforts. Finally, choose whether to run your business out of your home or rent a commercial space. Running a business from home can save costs but may limit growth opportunities. Renting a commercial space can give you more room to expand but increase your overhead expenses. Careful consideration and planning can help you make the best decision for your business. By taking these steps, you can start your business with a solid foundation and increase your chances of success in the long run."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

In spite of these doubts, women's houses dotted the countryside throughout Europe. There were seventyfour Dominican female houses in Germany, fortytwo in Italy, nine in France, eight in Spain, six in Bohemia, three in Hungary, and three in Poland. Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as Beguines, that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There were one hundred and fiftyseven nunneries in the order by 1358.

Millions of shoppers are rushing to buy their Christmas presents online today, lured by the promise of huge discounts. However, the sales figures for next Monday, known as “Manic Monday”, are expected to be even bigger, peaking at £675million, or £470,000 per minute. Retailers are hoping for a successful Cyber Monday, following the disappointing sales figures on Black Friday, where IT systems crashed, causing customers to miss out on deals. Major retailers such as John Lewis, Tesco, Argos, and Boots all experienced website crashes due to the high demand from shoppers. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are American events linked to the Thanksgiving holiday, but they have taken off in the UK over the past few years. Experts believe that shoppers will do most of their sales shopping now, killing off the traditional Boxing Day sales. It’s vital for retailers to have stable IT systems in place to manage the surge in online traffic, indicating a need for technology investment in online retail stores. Perhaps retailers have been too focused on generating online sales and are neglecting the importance of stable IT systems. Shoppers are left disappointed when the websites crash and don’t always return to the same online store. In summary, Cyber Monday looks set to be a huge success for UK retailers, although there is some concern around IT system failures affecting sales. Consumers are keen to snap up a bargain and are increasingly looking to online stores to do so, further emphasising the need for stable IT systems in place to support the surge in online traffic. It remains to be seen whether the traditional Boxing Day sales will make a comeback or if Black Friday and Cyber Monday will continue to dominate the UK's pre-Christmas shopping season."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, food = Japanese, priceRange = less than £20, area = riverside.

Changing the filter is an essential step, as it ensures that the water is free of harmful toxins and waste products. It is important to invest in a high-quality filter to ensure that it functions properly and lasts a long time. Replacing it per the manufacturer's recommended frequency is equally important.

Instead, use a siphon or a gravel cleaner to remove waste products. Proper maintenance of an aquarium goes beyond just appearance. Neglecting to change the filter or clean the gravel regularly can lead to algae growth, foul odors, and water discoloration. Moreover, poor water quality can harm the health and wellbeing of your fish. By following these simple instructions, you can ensure a clean and healthy environment for your aquatic pets.

Wilshere had been out of action for several weeks after breaking his foot, but showed no signs of rust in his performance. His inclusion in the squad for the final could be a major boost for Arsenal.

He called on Whitehall to was to scrap the Climate Change Act. Warned claims of impending environmental disaster were 'exaggerated' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Former Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, has called for the UK government to scrap the costly Climate Change Act. In a recent statement, he argued that the support for flawed wind and solar power has cost billions of pounds and made electricity and gas needlessly expensive for consumers. Paterson warned that claims of an impending environmental disaster have been exaggerated and called on Whitehall to refocus its efforts on promoting greater energy efficiency instead. According to Paterson, the escalating costs of renewable energy subsidies have caused significant harm to the economy, leading to job losses in both the manufacturing and energy sectors. He argues that the support for these technologies has been misguided, as they have failed to deliver the promised reductions in carbon emissions. Paterson suggests that the government should abandon its fixation with wind and solar power and invest in more efficient technologies such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage. Paterson's calls have sparked a debate within the industry, with some stakeholders arguing that renewables are vital to reducing the UK's carbon footprint and combating climate change. However, others agree with Paterson's assertion that support for wind and solar power has been costly without delivering results. Regardless of the debate, it is clear that the UK faces significant challenges in meeting its environmental targets while keeping energy affordable for consumers. It remains to be seen whether the government will recalibrate its energy policy in light of these concerns, or whether the Climate Change Act will remain in place despite calls to scrap it."},{"instruction":"Question: what was the capital of brazil before brasilia??

The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with nonIberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War until 1648 and the FrancoSpanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the DutchPortuguese War until 1663.

This was a significant achievement for the country and was due to the government's efforts to improve education. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese government began to prioritize education as a means of modernization and improving the standard of living for its citizens. In 1921, the Ministry of Education was established, and efforts were made to increase access to education at all levels. By 1949, when the People's Republic of China was established, the literacy rate had risen from 20% to around 80%. The government had established a universal education system, and education was free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 13. At the same time, higher education was also expanding rapidly. In 1949, there were only 205 universities and colleges in China, but by the mid-1950s, that number had grown to over 800. The government encouraged individuals to pursue higher education as a means of improving their employment prospects and contributing to the country's development. As a result of these efforts, the number of individuals with a higher education began to surpass the number of illiterate individuals. While exact numbers are not available, by the mid-20th century, it was estimated that around 20% of the population had some form of higher education, while only around 15-20% of the population remained illiterate. Overall, the efforts made by the Chinese government to improve education in Republic China were successful. By prioritizing education, the country was able to significantly increase its literacy rate and establish a strong higher education system. This was a crucial step in the country's development and helped to lay the foundation for its rapid economic growth in the latter half of the 20th century."},{"instruction":"Review: 's black hawk down with more heart Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

Don't take the gossip as true. Don't make exceptions for gossip you know is true. Keep secrets. Never start rumors yourself. Know when to report rumors to teachers.","output":"Gossip is a common and often harmful practice that we see in our daily lives. It can be tempting to share information that we have heard about others, but it is important to resist this urge and follow some basic principles to avoid the negative consequences of gossip. Firstly, it is important not to pass the gossip along. Once you have heard a rumor, the best thing you can do is keep it to yourself. Sharing it with others only spreads the possibility of misinformation and can harm the person who is being gossiped about. Equally important is not to take the gossip as true. Unless you have firsthand knowledge of a situation, it's best to approach gossip with skepticism. It is vital to remember that gossip can be inaccurate or exaggerated, and you don't want to harm someone's reputation on the basis of misinformation. Don't make exceptions for gossip you know is true. Even if you know a rumor to be true, it is important to resist the temptation to share it with others. The reason for this is that even if a rumor is true, its spread can cause harm and may not be in anyone's best interest. Keeping secrets is another important aspect of avoiding gossip. If someone confides in you about something personal, it's essential to keep that information private. You don't want to betray someone's trust or make them feel like their personal information is not safe with you. Moreover, never start rumors yourself. Gossip can be extremely harmful, and starting a rumor is never worth it. Instead, focus your energy on building positive relationships and making meaningful connections. Finally, it's crucial to know when to report rumors to teachers. If you learn about a serious situation that could harm someone's safety or well-being, it is important to bring it to the attention of someone in authority. Teachers and administrators can help solve problems or provide support if needed. In summary, gossip can be harmful, inaccurate and hurtful.

The incident allegedly occurred after a party earlier this month, when Rubenstein took the woman home. According to her account, she woke up bruised and bleeding, and accused him of rape. Her lawyers have now demanded his arrest, and the district attorney's office is reportedly reviewing the matter. Rubenstein has denied the allegations, claiming that the encounter was consensual. He has been a high-profile figure in New York's civil rights community for decades, representing victims of police brutality and other injustices. He has also been a close ally of Sharpton, and has been involved in numerous high-profile cases alongside the activist. The allegations against Rubenstein have sent shockwaves through New York's legal and political circles, with many expressing sympathy for the alleged victim and concern over the potential impact on the civil rights movement. Some have also criticized Sharpton for standing by Rubenstein in the wake of the accusations, though the activist has publicly stated his support for the victim. At this point, it is unclear how the case will play out, and whether Rubenstein will face criminal charges. However, the allegations serve as a sobering reminder of the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, even within circles that purport to be champions of justice and equality. It is crucial that all allegations of sexual misconduct are taken seriously and investigated thoroughly, regardless of the perceived status or power of the accused.

Finally, it's time to separate each of these parts into two separate strings. Again, use your fingers to guide the thread and gently tease apart each section. Once you're finished, you should have three groups of two strings each, ready to use in your project.

Smell the inside of your wrist where the saliva has dried. Try swabbing the back of your tongue.","output":"Have you ever wondered if your breath smells bad? While bad breath, or halitosis, can be caused by a variety of factors, one quick and easy way to check if your breath is fresh is to lick the inside of your wrist and then smell it after the saliva has dried. Saliva contains enzymes that break down food particles, and these particles can cause bad breath if they are not properly removed. By licking the inside of your wrist and smelling it, you are getting a sense of how your breath smells to others. If you find that your breath smells bad, there are a few steps you can take to improve it. First, make sure that you are practicing good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing daily, and using mouthwash. You may also want to consider using a tongue scraper to remove any bacteria or food particles from your tongue. Another tip is to stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water can help flush out any bacteria or food particles lingering in your mouth. Additionally, chewing sugar-free gum can stimulate saliva production, which can help wash away any odor-causing particles. If you still find that your breath smells bad despite these efforts, it may be worth talking to your dentist or doctor to rule out any underlying health conditions. In addition to licking your wrist, you can also try swabbing the back of your tongue with a cotton swab and smelling it. This can give you an even better idea of how your breath smells, as the back of the tongue is a common area for bacteria to accumulate. Overall, checking your breath is an important step in maintaining good oral hygiene and overall health. So go ahead, lick your wrist, and take a whiff. Your coworkers (and your dentist) will thank you."},{"instruction":"Data: name = The Wrestlers, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, priceRange = moderate, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no, near = Raja Indian Cuisine.

Remove any lowhanging and damaged branches to shape your tree.","output":"Pruning young trees is an essential step in maintaining their health and ensuring they grow into strong, productive plants. When the tree is 1-2 years old, it is important to prune it into the central leader position. This involves leaving one main branch at the top of the tree, which will become the central trunk. All other branches should be removed to allow for the development of a sturdy, straight trunk. When pruning your tree, it is important to keep in mind the thickness of the branches you are removing. Branches that are thicker than one-third of your trunk's diameter should be cut off, as they may become too heavy for the trunk to support as the tree grows. Any forked branches should also be removed, either by cutting them back to a single shoot or at the trunk. This will help ensure that the tree grows with a single strong trunk, rather than multiple weaker trunks. Another important step in pruning your tree is to trim off any branches that cross or rub together. This can cause damage to the bark and create openings for disease and pests to enter the tree. By removing these branches, you can keep your tree healthy and prevent potential problems down the line. Finally, be sure to remove any low-hanging or damaged branches to shape your tree as it grows. Low-hanging branches can become a hazard for pedestrians, and damaged branches can make your tree vulnerable to disease and pests. In summary, pruning your young tree is an essential step in its development. By following these guidelines - pruning into the central leader position, removing thick and forked branches, trimming branches that cross or rub, and removing low-hanging and damaged branches - you can help ensure a healthy, productive tree for years to come."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: yet this intervening period need not be wasted. it should be used to cut down the obstructions in his character and to fill up the deficiencies in his equipment.","output":"Yet this intervening period need not be wasted.

He claims that the supposed beneficiaries of affirmative action – minorities – do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy. Sander's claims have been disputed, and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism. A group including some of the country's lead statistical methodologists told the Supreme Court that Sander's analyses were sufficiently flawed that the Court would be wise to ignore them entirely.

This is a common condition that occurs when the cushioning disks between the vertebrae in your spine bulge out of place. It can be caused by aging, injury, or poor posture.

If you are experiencing constant or sharp pain, or if the pain radiates down your arms or legs, it could be a sign of a bulging disc. If you do experience pain, it is important to take immediate action to help alleviate the symptoms. The first thing you should do is apply ice to your neck. This can help reduce inflammation and alleviate some of the pain. Taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can also help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen or aspirin can be helpful, but be sure to follow the dosing instructions on the label. Switching to moist heat, such as a warm compress or a hot shower, can also help alleviate symptoms. The heat can help soothe sore muscles and reduce pain and inflammation. Finally, it is important to limit activities that may be aggravating your neck for a few days while you recover. This may mean avoiding strenuous exercise, heavy lifting, or other activities that require you to bend your neck or twist your head.

The threat against Khiva can be traced back to the 19th century when the Russian Empire began its expansion into Central Asia. Khiva, a small khanate located in present-day Uzbekistan, was one of the last remaining independent states in the region. In the late 1800s, Russia began to put pressure on Khiva to accept Russian suzerainty. When Khiva refused, Russia launched a military campaign against the khanate in 1873, ultimately annexing it in 1876. The Basmachi movement, on the other hand, emerged in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917. The movement was made up of Central Asian rebels who opposed the Bolsheviks' attempts to impose their authority on the region. The Basmachi engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Bolsheviks throughout the 1920s, but were eventually suppressed by Soviet forces in the 1930s. Therefore, it is clear that the threat against Khiva occurred before the emergence of the Basmachi movement. While both events are significant in Central Asian history, they cannot be conflated or seen as directly related."},{"instruction":"Tweet: @Chet6 You're absolutely right man makes us sound like Sunshine...

Whether you are preparing a dessert or creating a craft project, this process can help you achieve your desired results. For those who are unfamiliar with wafer cones, they are a popular dessert ingredient that is commonly used in ice cream cones. These cones are made from a crispy wafer material and are shaped like a cone. However, the base of the cone can be quite thick, which can make them difficult to work with. To cut the base from each wafer cone, you will need a sharp knife or scissors. Carefully hold the cone in one hand and use the blade of the knife or scissors to cut around the base of the cone. Be sure to apply enough pressure to cut through the thick wafer material, but be careful not to cut through the entire cone. Once the base has been removed, you will be left with a cone that is easier to work with. This is particularly helpful when you are assembling a dessert, as it allows you to place the cone upright without it tipping over. It also makes the cone easier to fill with ice cream or other ingredients, as there is no longer a thick layer of wafer material getting in the way. Cutting the base from each wafer cone can also be useful when creating craft projects. For example, if you are making a Christmas tree decoration out of wafer cones, removing the base can help you to stack the cones easily and create a more stable structure. It can also make it easier to glue the cones together without any bumps or uneven surfaces. In conclusion, cutting the base from each wafer cone can be a helpful technique for a variety of situations. Whether you are creating a dessert or a craft project, this process can help you to achieve your desired results with greater ease and precision. So next time you are working with wafer cones, consider giving this technique a try!"},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise Samantha needs to buy new running shoes.

However, Price repeatedly overpaid herself and ended up stealing a total of £16,470. Price admitted to taking the money from the company owned by her sister Kenis and brother-in-law Gareth Thomas 'because it was so easy'. This act of embezzlement and betrayal had serious consequences for Price. Today, she was sentenced to eight months in jail at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court. This case highlights the dangers of nepotism in business. Price abused her position of trust and authority in her family's electrical firm in order to enrich herself at the company's expense. Her repeated overpayments are a clear indication of her disregard for the company's financial wellbeing and an absence of ethical considerations. This kind of behaviour must be condemned and punished. Embezzlement not only erodes trust among colleagues and employees but also has serious legal implications. Price's jail sentence can serve as a warning to others about the severity of such financial crimes. In conclusion, Deborah Price's actions are a sobering reminder that financial misconduct can happen in any organisation, including those run by family members. It's essential that businesses and companies have adequate checks and balances in place to prevent embezzlement by insiders. And when such crimes do occur, harsh punishment must be meted out, as seen in Price's case."},{"instruction":"wpa personal—select this option if the wireless network requires a wpa preshared key.
