Why should a landlord in Düsseldorf, Berlin (both Germany) or London (UK) do something like this? I am a landlord in the first-mentioned city myself and have no problems finding good tenants. However, a friend was offered cheaper rent once. She had lost her job and the unemployment benefit would not have been sufficient to cover the rent for the apartment. Since she had been living in the apartment for a long time, the landlord then offered her a cheaper rent temporarily, but the city also has vacancies, which means that tenants do not compete for apartments, but apartments for tenants and the area also suffered a bit in quality over her years living there, so finding a good new tenant would have quite likely been a bit of a headache for her landlord. The only time I moved out of an apartment in a smaller city, was to get back to a bigger city, knowing full well that it would double my rent, so there is no incentive by offering a lower rent. In most cases, people also have already secured their new place when the current landlord is made aware of the cancellation, so any such attempts would be rather useless anyway."},{"instruction":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?","output":"Rules.

They are: 1.) Sometimes the system needs one, maybe the system very badly needs one, but nobody really knows it does. The performance shortfall is just ignored, and even though the system could be a lot better nobody really knows or cares. There are various levels of gray in the soupy imperfect world of feedlines and antennas. “Need” is relative to where we are in that soup. Sometimes “just okay” is good enough. 2.) Other times transmission line lengths, routing, and grounding are such that a simple transmission line acts like a natural balun. I (and many others) do this intentionally in some antenna designs by grounding a floating coaxial cable 1/4 wave from a balanced feedpoint. There are a number of common myths about baluns and antennas. Here are two common but very wrong myths: 1.) The impedance of a free-space propagating electromagnetic wave has to be matched to a radio or a transmission line, and thus a ~377 ohm feedline does not need a balun. Or a ~377 ohm feedpoint like folded dipole somehow magically couples to free space. 2.) An impedance mismatch causes a system to have unwanted feedline radiation, or common mode current. If the feedline is matched the need a balun is magically reduced. Balun is an acronym for “BALanced” and UNbalanced”. While baluns have an impedance ratio, that impedance ratio and the line mismatch have absolutely nothing to do with the need for a balanced to unbalanced transition. A balun is sometimes a good idea, and sometimes a waste of time. It really depends on the exact system."},{"instruction":"w can matter be completely destroyed from existence?

What's your story?","output":"I ended up in the Bay Area because I was fed up with the life I had in Tennessee, and because a friend in Alameda offered me her couch. I had been working as a call center representative for 3+ years in Murfreesboro, TN, and I was miserable. I’d spent the previous 4 years getting a BS in Audio Engineering at the prestigious Recording Industry program Middle Tennessee State offered. I had a huge desire to get into a music production career in Nashville, but after sobering up from a summer internship where I got a cold taste of how hard it is to make a living in the music industry, I settled into the life of a call center worker to pay the rent and avoid moving back in with my parents. I was living paycheck to paycheck, but I had my own apartment and health insurance, so life seemed manageable. During these 3 years I went through a brief marriage to my long-term girlfriend, but we seperated six months after eloping. I had very few friends left in my college town, and spent most of my time outside of work locked in my apartment writing music and playing video games. I was deeply depressed, but after the 2008 recession hit, I decided this was about as good as I could expect my life to get for the foreseeable future. Around February of 2009, I reconnected with an old middle school friend on Facebook. She’d left our hometown in Alabama after college and gone out west to find work. Eventually she settled in the Bay Area and was working as a marketing consultant for Kaiser. We shared our life stories for months and eventually I visited her and her friends in July. I still remember her picking me up from the airport and driving me across the Bay Bridge for the first time. I couldn’t believe the sheer number of buildings, people and cars all around me, not to mention how beautiful the bay looked going over the bridge. I met so many people from so many different walks of life in the short week I visited, and it humbled me deeply. For a southern guy like myself, the Bay Area felt like another country I’d stumbled into. When I returned home, my mind was set. I would quit my call center gig, pack my car, and start driving out west in a month…no exceptions. I had no job lined up, only an offer to stay with my friend and her roommates until I’d secured full-time work. I spent three days driving along I-40 from Nashville to Oakland, staying at cheap motels and using directions I’d printed off in advance from Mapquest. It was the most adventurous I’d ever gotten in my entire life. It’s been almost 10 years since I arrived, and I wouldn’t have done anything differently. I’ve had the opportunity to work for some amazing companies without having a software engineering or product background; opportunities I would have never gotten back home. I met my wife out here, who I’ve now been with for over 6 years and could not be any happier sharing life together. And I’ve had countless experiences and interactions with so many people who come from different backgrounds and cultures from my own, and it’s changed my perspective on so many issues that would have remained stagnant and unbending if I had resigned myself to my previous life. When I was getting my car prepped for the journey out here, I remember our long-time family mechanic asking me where I was heading off to. “San Francisco”, I said with a beaming glow of hope and optimism on my face. “Ahh! It’s so beautiful. It’ll change you though. Don’t forget where you came from.” I haven’t."},{"instruction":"What are some examples of arguments against the existence of an afterlife?","output":"Harry Houdini was a sceptic, but one who tried to test his scepticism. He would often visit mediums of the time, not to mock them, but to find one that he believed could actually communicate with the dead. He wanted desperately to communicate with his dead mother but, as a magician, knew full well the techniques used to trick a mark. With all his searching he was never convinced any medium could do as they claimed, though he also asserted that this was not evidence that it couldn’t be done, only that no one had done it yet. So, what next? Well, he and his wife hatched a cunning plan which involved two things, a secret phrase and a promise to “come back”. The next step was taken care of when Houdini died, on Halloween, from a ruptured appendix. For the next ten years his wife would visit every medium around, asking them to communicate with her dead husband. I imagine it was the same usual guff about how he loves her and misses her and then she asks about the secret message… excuses probably followed but no message matching the aforementioned planned text. She is quoted saying “Ten years is long enough to wait for any man.” So if Harry Houdini, the worlds most famous escape artist, couldn’t get back to give his wife a message, maybe there is no there to come back from."},{"instruction":"What happened to IBM, and is the company still alive?","output":"IBM is still alive and well, but it has certainly seen its ups and downs over the years. The company was once the dominant force in the computer industry, but it lost market share to Microsoft and Intel in the 1990s. In 2005, IBM sold its PC hardware business to Lenovo, and it has since focused on more specialized areas of the market, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. There were a number of factors that contributed to IBM's decline, including: A failure to adapt to the changing market, as personal computers became more popular and IBM's mainframes became less relevant.Souring relationships with business partners, as IBM became more focused on its own products and less willing to work with others.A tragic leadership loss, as CEO Louis Gerstner died in 2000. Despite these challenges, IBM has managed to survive and even thrive in recent years. The company has made a number of strategic acquisitions, such as the purchase of Red Hat, and it has invested heavily in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. As a result, IBM is now well-positioned for the future of computing. Here are some of the things that IBM is currently working on: Cloud computing: IBM is one of the leading providers of cloud computing services, and it is investing heavily in this area.Artificial intelligence: IBM is a leader in artificial intelligence, and it is using AI to develop new products and services.Cybersecurity: IBM is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions, and it is helping businesses to protect themselves from cyber attacks. IBM is still a major player in the technology industry, and it is likely to continue to be a force in the years to come."},{"instruction":"What are the most underrated cities in the U.S.?","output":"Chicago for sure.

The various moral and ethical views of different religions around the world at that time are surprisingly similar."},{"instruction":"w do I counter the statement whatever that requires other people's labour is not a basic human right?","output":"Well, it’s going to be tough to challenge this on deontological grounds, since claiming that you have a right over other’s labour as a principle is a hard proposition to swallow. Scott Steward made a great point about it already, so I won’t go into details. What you could do is go with the utilitarian approach and focus on the benefits that this would provide, which hopefully would be good enough to make others forget about the inherent issue with freedom. Every society has some morally questionable rules that are in place because they are needed to keep the society working. A good example is having a police department payed by tax money, instead of letting people deal with their own security, investigating crimes, and bringing the outlaws to justice. This technically requires other people’s labour: the police officers’ work is needed in order to keep the system running, and the tax payer’s money (fruits of their labor) is required to pay the police officers. However, the benefits of the system are obvious to most people, so they are willing to do go with it; the society is greatly improved by this, even if a at a loss of liberty. So, think about your proposition: who will it benefit and who will it hurt? Are the benefits so great that the downside is no longer relevant? Would it greatly improve the society as a whole? If you manage to find good answers, you could argue that any society requires some concessions from the ideal moral principle and that your idea is at least worthy of consideration."},{"instruction":"w do I buy a stock after the markets close on Upstox and Zerodha?","output":"AFTER MARKET ORDER… .

It will take over all the dangerous jobs, and it will be used to explore Space even further, almost like in those sci-fi movies we used to watch when we were little. From a personal point of view, I am most excited for a better and improved Space exploration, but also the improvement in the terms of medicine. Maybe with the help of these “machines”, we will finally have the answers for some of the most difficult questions that are troubling today’s society. Or just imagine if with their help we manage to find a way to cure most of the deceases, resulting in prolonging our lifespan. From a business perspective, I am also very excited and looking forward to all those unimaginable improvements that AI will offer for developing businesses. It will make it easy for both big and small companies to manage their work better and faster. It might even take over some of the jobs that now are done by people. Well, this is where it gets scary for me. What if all of this goes too far, and it comes to a point that we can’t control it? People are known to be greedy for power, so I am expecting that the companies or even some individuals will fight to prove who is bigger and better in this field. In a few decades, or centuries we will have unimaginable progress in our society. However it will put humanity to a test, and there will come a time when we will have to slow down and leave nature takes its course.

Itachi has: AmaterasuTsukoymiYata mirrorTotsuka bladeMastery over fire style3 chakra natures Tobirama has: Flying thunder godShadow clone jutsuEdo tenseiMutually Multiplying Explosive TagsMastery over water style5 Chakra natures So how would the fight go? In overall knowledge Tobirama has Itachi beat Also if this fight happened Tobirama would know that Itachi is an Uchiha before the fight even begins, how does he do it? he senses the person's chakra and from there he's able to tell what village they're from, what clan, or what their body is made out of( only did that one to Orochimaru) Tobirama has apparently seen Amaterasu before He knowns about the Sussano since he saw Hashirama fighting Madara He knows about the Ems and Ms since Madara and IzunaHe knows about the Uchiha’s genjutsuHe knows about their affinity in fire style While Itachi would have some knowledge it wouldn't be enough to help Tobirama being the 2and HokageTobirama being a SenjuAnd maybe know about Tobirama having mastery over water style While knowledge dosen't matter much it does give a slight advantage. While this stament might not be true but If Jiraya had full Intel he would've done much better agasint Pain since Jiraya was just trying to figure out all of Pain’s abbilties leading to his death So Intel does matter quite a bit. So Itachi's fire style Vs Tobirama's water style So Itachi's mastery over fire style wouldn't matter much since Tobirama has mastered water style better then Itachi has masterd his fire style even Sasuke was able to match Itachi's fire style I haven't even mentioned that that Tobirama has the elemental advantage Genjutsu So genjutsu I'm pretty sure Tobirama would be experienced enough to not look into ltachi's eye's or detect if he's in a genjutsu (since Tobirama is one of the best sensory type ninja like Minato) and determine whether he's under the effects of genjutsu. Nagato was able to determine the exact location of the person controlling him through their chakra, despite said person erecting a barrier around themselves. itachi’s tsukyomi wouldn’t work first of all because he would never look in his eyes, nor any other move with eye contact. He also understand that people with mangekyou have specific powers including the susanoo so he would keep his guard and distance from him imuntil the perfect time in case of anything (like Amaterasu). Amaterasu Amaterasu wouldn't work since the 4th Raikage was able to doge it I haven't even mentioned that Tobirama might be able to feel Itachi’s chakra build up in his eye’s and might be ready to doge it since like I said he's a sensory type Tobiramas speed is comparable to Minato and Kcm 1 Naruto probably a little slower he's probably equal or a little faster then the 4th raikage. Yata mirror and the Totsuka blade The Yata mirror is not not omni directional People always say what's Madara gonna do agasint the Yata mirror? Or anytime people put Itachi in Vs battle what X characters do against the Yata mirror? Well, Itachi can't keep it forever Itachi has shown that he needs to finish fights quickly indicating that he dosen't have much chakra so Itachi can't keep this thing forever Also Tobirama can teleport inside of the Yata mirror or teleport Itachi out of the Yata mirror Since Gaara was able to grab Madara out of his Sussano with his sand And Itachi still has the Ms and not the Ems so he can still go blind like Sasuke did and Sasuke fought Danzo, 4th Raikage, Mei he got demolished agasint Onoki and didn't use any of his ms abbilties. If Itachi goes blind or is near blindness it's over for him he wouldn't be able to react to Tobirama anymore and is open for a speed blitz If Itachi does go blind he will lose his Yata mirror and will not be able to react to Tobirama since he's blind and is blitzed if this actually happens Itachi won't be so eager to use Izanami because it kills one of his eyes If Itachi does miss Amataersu and can't capture Tobirama in a genjutsu it's over since Tobirama will avoid looking Itachi in the eyes and will be ready for Amataersu The longer the fights goes the more at disadvantage Itachi is since his vision will get worst and has the risk of running out of chakra then it's over for Itachi. So imo Tobirama wins I know that Itachi is strong But some people seriosuly think that Itachi can beat Madara or Kagyua Some people seriously underestimate him that say that Jiraya would beat him and some people who say that he can beat Madara Itachi is Powerful but he's not God tier like Kagyua, Hagromo, Jubidara, Juubito etc and he can't beat people Like Madara or Hashirama So hope you liked my answer!"},{"instruction":"w many libertarians reign the Freedom Caucus, and who are they?","output":"None. There are no serious libertarians in Congress. The House Freedom Caucus (“HFC”) is a group of conservatives, none of whom are particularly committed to the non-aggression principle or “NAP,” which is the hallmark of libertarian thinking. The HFC sometimes self-identifies as “libertarian” because that label has now become fairly trendy among thoughtful political activists and thus has become a label some people find useful to co-opt. But, conservatives are not libertarian; in fact, they are kind of polar opposites, who find some rhetorical similarities only if one maps politics using the traditional “left-right” linear paradigm. Using something more sophisticated, such as “the Nolan Chart,” one rapidly sees that conservatives are no more “libertarian” than are liberals. These are three different political philosophies. Conservatives give lip-service to lower taxes and that often results in public confusion with libertarians who’s guiding principle - the NAP - dictates that all taxes, being involuntary transfers, are simply a form of theft, which should not be tolerated by civilized society. While conservatives often talk about lower taxes, there is no principle of conservatism that mandates or even suggests a level of appropriate taxation. Conservatism, as a philosophy, is a commitment to traditional values and ideas, with opposition to change or innovation. Because conservatism has no particular philosophical commitment to low taxes, conservatives in Congress have never actually reduced the overall level of spending significantly or eliminated any state or federal agencies. At best, they have shifted the burden of paying taxes away from having business and wealthy people paying, and instead foisted the burden of paying taxes onto the middle and lower classes. Conservatives are committed to build-ups of the military, spy agencies, border patrols, police and related government agencies that operate to make the world safe for big business and result in “crony-capitalism.” Conservatives approve of agencies like the import-export bank, various agribusiness and banking subsidies, and tariffs that favor big, well-established business entities. Conservatives are committed to “traditional” family values, meaning an opposition to same-sex marriage, personal choice in matters of drug ingestion, and a commitment to forced national service in the form of the draft. Conservatives generally have little or nothing in common with libertarians on a wide range of social issues, and really are quite different in their thinking on even budgetary issues. Conservatives dominate the Republican Party and, if honest, Republican conservatives will even say openly that they are not committed to a reduction in government control over people’s lives, but rather favor a government that is big enough and powerful enough to make the world safe for big business and to spread conservative social values by force. Unlike conservatism, which is committed to long-established institutions, libertarianism has no interest in the past but is instead a philosophy for the future that embraces peaceful diversity along with free trade and free travel for all people; its guiding principle is not a commitment to traditional values, but rather a commitment to the non-aggression principle, holding that people should be free to live their lives as they see fit unless they are stealing things or hitting people. Ron Paul, a former Congressman, and his son, Rand Paul are both Republicans, who sometimes advocated for some policy positions embraced by libertarians on some issues, but Ron Paul has left Congress and neither was ever a member of the HFC."},{"instruction":"Did the Kaminoans know they were working for Count Dooku and he was leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems?","output":"No, they thought they were working for Sifu Dias.

Can someone explain it in simple words?","output":"Okay - your fingerprints are unique, right? No one else has fingerprints like you. Wherever you go, your fingerprints will something that identifies you as you. And they are pretty easy to get at - you hold out your hand, and someone can see them. And your fingerprints are something you have from birth - no one gives them to you. You are born with them and you have them for the whole of your life. But your address (of your house) is only unique for the town you are living in. And it is something that is assigned to you when you move in to your house - you (generally) don’t get to pick it since you move into a house and the house already has an address. I live at 56 Croxley Street (I don’t - why would I give you my address?). And there must be a dozen or so 56 Croxley Streets around Great Britain. My address is only unique for the town I live in (Covenstone in Freedonia County). But my fingerprints - they are unique all the time, even if I move house. x-x-x The MAC address of a computer is like your fingerprints - it is unique ALL the time. It is the unique address of the network card, and it never changes. It is assigned based on where the computer is made (or something like that - I’m not entirely sure and it doesn’t really matter) and it exists for the lifetime of that network card. But your IP address is only unique for your computer while it exists inside your network. Your next door neighbours will have a device with the same IP address, because that’s how private ip addresses work. Private IP addresses are used all over the country (probably the world) and are limited to a certain range so that every computer in a house can have the same private IP address - because it’s private. The private IP address is like your house address, and the network is your town. And if you move your computer to a new network (if you take it your parents’ house or your girlfriend’s house) then it will be assigned a new private IP address while it is there. But the MAC address will stay the same, because - like your fingerprints - it never changes. x-x-x The analogy stretches a little further - you can prevent computers/tablets/phones etc with certain MAC addresses accessing your Wifi network just like you can put fingerprint scanners at the door of your building to stop certain people getting in. But now we’re kind of wandering outside the realms of the original answer. But - in short :- MAC address is unique and it persists for the life of the network card (which essentially is the life of the device). And it comes from the device - it is an internal address. IP address is unique only for the time the device is in the network which assigned it. And it comes from the network - it is an external address."},{"instruction":"Why does a short circuit pop a breaker (in simple terms)?","output":"Many newer circuit breakers have 2 mechanisms to detect over current. One is a magnetic circuit. When a current flows through a conductor it creates a magnetic field around it. The conductor is wound into a coil to increase the magnetism. This is called a solenoid. The magnetic solenoid ( number 7 non the drawing below) operates instantly a very high current is sensed. This operates a trip mechanism which opens the circuit stopping the very high current flow. This mechanism protects against a short circuit. The other sensing element is a bimetal strip which heats up when too much current is flowing through it and bends because it is made of two dissimilar metals that expand at a different rate. (Number 5 on the drawing above) When the strip has bent too much that operates a trip mechanism and opens the circuit. The bimetal strip senses an overload. It takes time to heat so it will allow an overload for a short while.. The circuit breaker should be matched carefully to the current flowing through the load and the maximum current allowed by the standards or regulations for the cable size."},{"instruction":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from “The New Warriors?”","output":"You guys remember Bunker?

They’re that tone-deaf. I predict that this book will be canceled in 12 issues and these characters will be relegated to the dust bin of history until 20 years from now when a TV show reinvents them into something workable. Which is a shame because I really like this art style and some of the ideas here are actually kind of good. I just have zero faith in the creative team to pull them off.

The stronger the concentration, the deeper the and longer-lasting the fragrance. An attar is the strongest, being the pure form of a fragrance in the extraction oil - a single drop of attar is powerful and long-lasting. Next, parfum (or extrait) is diluted in oil or water but has a high concentration of fragrance. After that, EDP, with a slightly lower concentration of the perfume. Then, EDT, with a lower concentration of fragrance still - it often has a ‘thinner’ smell and won't generally last as long as an EDP. EDC is less concentrated still and is the lightest of the formulations. Because the depth of a fragrance is affected by the concentration, some fragrances can smell markedly different in the different formulations - Narciso Rodriguez for Her is a good example of this - the EDT and EDP somehow smell very different. Often, an EDP of one fragrance may be too heavy for daytime wear, while an EDT will be lighter and easier. I find Mitsouko EDT very wearable for daytime use, while the EDP and parfum are far more of a nightime scent, deeper and more complex. Layering an EDT with a parfum/EDP can give the EDT an extra dimension without the weight one might find with a stronger formulation. Point of note - Guerlain sometimes use PDT (parfum de toilette) instead of EDP.

Whenever we are going to compare Granite vs Marble, the texture, color, or the appearance play the major role in determining the type of stone. Granite : Granite is an igneous rock formed deep within the earth when minerals crystallize. Because of this, it often has a granular appearance, though this is often combined with large scale patterns. It consists of quartz, feldspar, mica, and hornblende along with other trace minerals which provide a nearly endless variety of colors and patterns. ([LINKED_TEXT: Black Granite Paving] [URL: https://royalestones.co.uk/categories/granite-paving.html] Ideas) Marble : Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite. Marble is typically not foliated, although there are exceptions. In geology, the term \\"marble\\" refers to metamorphosed limestone, but its use in stone masonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone. Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.

It is common practice to not announce the death of one leader until you have a new leader in place. The Soviets were very good at keeping these announcements held back for 3 or 4 days depending on how quickly the new leader is agreed upon. In theory this prevents enemies from taking military or economic advantage of the bereaved nation during a transition period. It is further complicated by the fact that the actual Supreme Leader is still Chairman Kim Il-sung. North Korea is the only necrocracy in the world, their true (and eternal) leader is actually dead. In the United States of America and most western countries we have a constitutional plan of succession that allows us to instantly and legally transition to the new leader. “The King is Dead, Longlive the King!” it is instantaneous. In our case an oath is also taken as soon as possible just to firm it all up. In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) there is a semi assumed, but not guaranteed, order of succession if their is a hereditary heir available. In the case of Chairman Kim the hereditary heir is a child. So either his younger sister steps up/in, and is accepted as the new Chairman (or at least a Regent), otherwise an insane battle where civil, emotional, constitutional, and perhaps military will compete for leadership and chaos is likely to break out. I feel like that our rigid system is far better than the uncertain flexibility and chaos that is possible with an undefined order if succession. It can take days to get everything in place under the system used in dictatorship like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has. Their system also creates situations just like we are in right now — where the Chairman may be sick, dead, or just out fishing. Even on their best days the hermit country of North Korea is highly secretive and even more so about anything to do with the Chairman and his family. As an example we don't officially whenmhus birthday is, how old he is, or how many children he has. All we know is that his wife disappeared from public for an extended period of time on three occasions. Intelligence analysts think she was with child during those three periods."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"MICROWAVE COOKING HEALTH RISKS Microwave ovens have become an essential kitchen appliance in many households due to their convenience and efficiency in cooking and reheating food. However, there have been concerns and debates regarding the potential health risks associated with cooking food in a microwave oven. While some studies suggest that microwaving food can cause negative health effects, it is important to examine the available evidence and understand the broader context before drawing any conclusions. Nutrient Loss: One of the main concerns about microwaving food is the potential loss of nutrients. Like any cooking method, microwaving can lead to some nutrient loss, but the extent of the loss depends on various factors such as the type of food, cooking time, and temperature. While certain vitamins, such as vitamin C and B vitamins, are sensitive to heat and can be affected by microwaving, other cooking methods like boiling and baking can also cause nutrient degradation. To minimize nutrient loss, it is recommended to use minimal amounts of water and cook food for shorter periods. Formation of Harmful Compounds: Another concern associated with microwaving is the formation of potentially harmful compounds in food. When food is heated, especially at high temperatures, certain chemical reactions can occur. One such reaction is the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are compounds that have been linked to various health issues like inflammation and oxidative stress. However, research suggests that the formation of AGEs is not unique to microwaving but can happen with other cooking methods as well, such as frying, grilling, or roasting. By using appropriate microwave-safe containers and avoiding excessive heating, the formation of harmful compounds can be minimized. Microwave Leakage: A common concern related to microwave ovens is the possibility of radiation leakage. Microwaves use non-ionizing radiation, which is considered safe for humans. However, if a microwave oven is damaged, has a faulty seal, or is not used correctly, it may lead to radiation leakage. Manufacturers design microwave ovens with safety features and conduct rigorous testing to ensure that they meet safety standards. It is important to regularly check the condition of the oven, avoid using it if there are visible damages, and follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure safe usage. Plastic Container Hazards: Microwaving food in plastic containers is a concern due to the potential leaching of harmful chemicals into the food. Some plastics contain chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) or phthalates, which can migrate into food when exposed to heat. To minimize this risk, it is advisable to use microwave-safe containers labeled as such and avoid using old or damaged plastic containers. Opting for glass, ceramic, or microwave-safe plastic containers can be a safer choice. Uneven Heating and Hot Spots: Microwaving food can sometimes result in uneven heating, creating hot spots that can lead to burns if not handled with caution. It is important to follow the recommended cooking times and stir or rotate the food during the cooking process to ensure even heating. Additionally, allowing food to stand for a short period after microwaving helps distribute heat evenly and ensures that any residual heat finishes cooking the food. Cooking food in a microwave oven does have some potential drawbacks and health concerns, but these risks can be minimized by taking appropriate precautions. While microwaving may result in some nutrient loss and the formation of potentially harmful compounds, similar concerns exist with other cooking methods as well. By using microwave-safe containers, avoiding excessive heating, and following the manufacturer's instructions, the risks associated with microwaving can be significantly reduced. Ultimately, maintaining a balanced and varied diet, using a variety of cooking methods, and consuming food in moderation are key to ensuring overall good health."},{"instruction":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

Many of them believed that India was indeed the home of all the western language and philosophical culture. Friedrich Schlegel wrote in one of his letters that India was the home of all languages, cultures, poems... The well famous quote of Voltaire, regarded as one of the greatest philosophers, goes as thus : I am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges, - [LINKED_TEXT: astronomy] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_astronomy], [LINKED_TEXT: astrology] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyoti%E1%B9%A3a], [LINKED_TEXT: metempsychosis] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metempsychosis], etc... It is very important to note that some 2,500 years ago at the least Pythagoras went from Samos to the Ganges to learn geometry...But he would certainly not have undertaken such a strange journey had the reputation of the Brahmins' science not been long established in Europe This was the main opinion among the European scholars till the Aryan colonial invasion theory. Soon, Indomania switched to an Indophobia.The translators of Vedas and other scriptures became more biased and so stubborn in quoting and finalising things. Now, the situation is that even linguistics has started to deny the Aryan Migration Theory, a modified form of the Invasion theory. If centum language should be the predecessor of the IE languages, and palatalization was the process of transformation, then according to the lateral theory which says that conservatisms are away from the core, then modern centum speaking areas cannot have the possibility for a homeland.Only those areas where the centum has entirely or at least entirely been palatalised, can have the possibility. That makes India a potential homeland.And the peculiar phenomenon, which scholars are ignoring till now, is that in India, the trend has been in opposite direction many a times, while the major trend is to palatalise, outside of India.In Sanskrit, we have the palatalization process, (example : ja-gAma, \\"ja\\"gat..)but in Prakrits, we have the opposite direction many a time : \\"rukka\\"<VrkSa, \\"nAk\\"<nAsa... Even this kind of phenomenon shows up in the South name for JyeSTha star : \\"K\\"etta(i). (though Malayalam word for elder brother is still \\"ch\\"etta(n) )The name of Kerala itself is an opposite derivation from \\"cheralam\\" (Land of Cheras or may even signify the \\"cheral\\"-mixing-of mountains and oceans)Thus, it is ambiguous to talk of centum to Satem transition INSIDE India, for India has shown the opposite trend too, save Sanskrit.This again puts, why it is still plausible to put forward a theory that sees IE languages as formed from the centum and Satem versions of a proto Vedic Indian language.And the long blame on India for \\"conserving only the Satem isogloss\\" is relieved from Bangani studies.So, a possiblility of Indian language for Proto Indo European is certainly not ridiculous, but an emerging alternative, and certainly a great question to the today's linguists to remove some of their preconceptions.So, that's how we defend it."},{"instruction":"Did Saudi Arabia and the UAE sign deals with Iran because they hope such deals will protect them from the fallout of a military strike on nuclear facilities?

Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are descendants of wolves, which are part of the Canidae family. While some domesticated dogs can grow quite large, they generally don't reach the size of the largest big cats such as lions or tigers. Evolutionarily, cats and dogs took divergent paths. Cats (Felidae family) evolved as solitary hunters, adapting to various habitats and developing specialized skills for hunting and surviving independently. On the other hand, dogs evolved as social pack animals, with the wolf being their closest wild ancestor. Pack dynamics, cooperative hunting, and group cohesion became vital for the survival and success of canids. The size of an animal is influenced by a combination of genetic, ecological, and evolutionary factors. Big cats like lions and tigers occupy specific ecological niches, and their large size has evolved to meet the demands of their hunting strategies and prey preferences. They require sufficient strength and power to take down and subdue larger herbivores. Dogs, as social predators, have adopted different survival strategies. Rather than relying solely on their individual strength, they have developed cooperative hunting behaviors, utilizing intelligence, agility, and teamwork to bring down prey. Their hunting style involves endurance, speed, and the ability to outmaneuver their quarry rather than overpowering them through sheer size. Furthermore, human intervention in the selective breeding of dogs has resulted in a wide variety of sizes and shapes for different purposes, from tiny Chihuahuas to massive Great Danes. However, even the largest dog breeds such as the St. Bernard or English Mastiff cannot compare in size and strength to the largest big cats. In summary, the absence of \\"big dogs\\" comparable to the largest big cats is due to differences in evolutionary history, ecological adaptations, and the diverse roles that dogs have played in human societies, ranging from companionship to working purposes. Each species has evolved unique characteristics and behaviors that suit their ecological niche and survival strategies."},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"Cats don't usually abandon their owners without reason. However, there can be various reasons why a cat may seem to distance itself from its owner or even leave their home. Here are some common reasons why a cat may leave or appear to abandon their owner: Medical issues: Cats may exhibit changes in behavior due to an underlying medical condition. Pain, discomfort, or illness can cause a cat to act differently or withdraw.Change in routine or environment: Cats are creatures of habit and prefer a predictable routine. If there are changes in their environment, such as moving to a new home, or if there are changes in their daily routine, such as a new work schedule, the cat may feel stressed and anxious.Lack of attention or affection: Cats thrive on attention and affection from their owners. If they feel neglected or ignored, they may start to distance themselves.Personality: Cats have unique personalities, and some cats may be more independent than others. Some cats may enjoy spending time alone, while others may crave constant attention.Trauma or abuse: If a cat has experienced trauma or abuse in the past, they may be more fearful or anxious, leading them to avoid certain people or situations. It's important to note that cats are not naturally inclined to abandon their owners without reason. However, if you notice your cat exhibiting changes in behavior, it's essential to consult with your veterinarian to rule out any underlying medical issues.

With the rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide, many individuals seek natural alternatives, including Ayurvedic medicine, to complement conventional treatments. In this article, we will delve into the realm of Ayurveda and explore some commonly used Ayurvedic medicines for managing diabetes. Understanding Ayurveda's Approach to Diabetes: Ayurveda views diabetes as a result of imbalances in the body's doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) and impaired digestion and metabolism. The aim of Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes is to restore balance, strengthen the digestive fire (agni), and improve overall well-being. It's important to note that Ayurvedic treatments should be undertaken with the guidance of a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner. Ayurvedic Medicines for Diabetes: Gurmar (Gymnema Sylvestre): Gurmar, meaning \\"sugar destroyer,\\" is a popular Ayurvedic herb known for its potential to support blood sugar regulation. It may help reduce sugar cravings, enhance insulin production, and improve glucose utilization. Gurmar can be consumed in the form of capsules, tablets, or as a tea.Jamun (Syzygium cumini): Jamun, also known as Indian blackberry, has been traditionally used in Ayurveda for its anti-diabetic properties. It is believed to help regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Jamun can be consumed in various forms, including as a fresh fruit, juice, or seed powder.Triphala: Triphala is a well-known Ayurvedic formulation consisting of three fruits: Amla (Indian gooseberry), Haritaki (Chebulic myrobalan), and Bibhitaki (Belleric myrobalan).

Would you still have to have a priest?","output":"Nobody needs a priest to marry. Marriage isn’t a religious function, it’s a civil one. Most clergy are authorized by the state to perform marriage ceremonies, but it’s the state’s authority, not religious authority, that makes the marriage binding. A marriage ceremony usually ends with the person performing it saying something like, “And now, by the power vested in me by the state of Kentucky, I now pronounce you husband and wife.” There are variations—sometimes they add in gods, and of course it’s not always “husband and wife”—but it’s the state that granted them the authority to declare the marriage. If you’re married by a judge, you’re married. If you get married again, you’re guilty of bigamy. If your spouse dies without a will, you still inherit their property. If you’re married by a priest or pastor who hasn’t been authorized by the state, you’re not married. If you get married again, you’re not guilty of any crime. If your spouse’s family contests their will, or if they die intestate, you won’t inherit. Civil marriage is the only kind that actually counts."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to invest in gold through SIP?","output":"Dear friend, From your question , I understood that you wish to invest in Gold on monthly or frequently like SIP. There are basically SIX ways to invest in gold.Seventh one is RBI Gold bond. My recommendations: 1]First choice- E GOLD if you have a Demat account.This will give best returns on a 20–25 year period.You can convert in to physical gold as and when you want. Second choice- Gold ETF . Third choice- RBI Gold bond , which gives 2.5% interest per year too. As an investor, i do not recommend any other , mainly due to poor long term returns. 2]Do not have more than 5–10 % of your total assets in Gold products.

This is primarily because we are comparing an “apple” and an “orange”. A polymath is someone who is adept in understanding a great number of things, usually from both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary standpoints. Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Asimov and R Buckminster Fuller, just to name a few, come to mind. An autodidact is just a self-taught, self-directed learner, who has a deep fascination for exploring the world and understanding a small number of things, usually from the standpoint of personal learning pursuit. The Wright Brothers (Orville and Wilbur) come to mind. They were bicycle mechanics, and yet they spent their entire lives in studying and understanding the long history of conquering flights like the birds prior to developing their own airplane eventually. It’s fair to say that polymaths often start off as autodidacts. More importantly, I feel very strongly and drawing on my own personal experience, there is an autodidact in each and every one of us, My two cents, anyway."},{"instruction":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","output":"That's funny because I never get messages from guys or girls or anyone lol I guess some are more to be desired or I look like the type of chick that would rip off thier heads and sg#@ down the wet end either way lol Why don't I get more boys advancing I wonder?

A soace colony is not a “station”."},{"instruction":"Why is Brutalism (architectural style) so unpopular and often disliked (specifically among nonarchitects)?","output":"I love Brutalism for too many reasons. First, living in a concrete building, if it was built and designed properly, which is a form of art, gives thousand times more comfort than living in any other type of construction. Concrete is strong, reliable, and safe. It looks plane but gives freedom both to the imagination and to the perception of space - clean lines, fresh air, without the traces of “old” odour that the other materials tend to leave. Brick buildings, even if relatively new, for example, retain humidity that you can hardly experience even in an old concrete building unless there is some serious flaw. I find its precise shapes very satisfying and calming especially with the right play of light. Lack of ornaments makes it much more open to individual choice despite of the reference to the communist regimes. You can combine it with different materials, shapes and colours to create the right environment. I guess, I like to see the underlying construction as the definer of the degree of creative freedom, of what it could become, and focus less on elusive decorum that doesn’t retain its originality and flawlessness for too long. If you cannot transform a concrete clean-cut to your vision, may be the latter is lacking. There is philosophical message to it - concrete is understated, solid, honest, leaves you with the feeling of space, and futuristic. It reminds me of stoicism, protestant churches and Asimov. Love the idea that a brutalist building looked from different angles and distance could appear quite differently. That said, some brutalist buildings have little windows, which could leave you with the feeling of imprisonment.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"First, elementary school: we sent our two daughters to a private parochial school until grade 5 for the older, grade 3 for the younger. The last year in that school for both kids was really sub-par. The teachers were not good, and even though there were only about 17–18 kids in each class, the poor behavior in each set was really noticeable. Both my girls said that they preferred their public school educations. My kids have also known peers who attended well-known private schools such as St. Ann’s (downtown Brooklyn). One of the things they found out about private school kids is that the kids do a lot more drugs. They have the money to do it, but they don’t get arrested for getting wasted. Overall, I think that the private school experience can be very crappy. But the people who make their livings there, or who swear by them, will spin the experience as lovely and amazing. BTW some of the worst, longest-lived cases of sexual abuse at schools have been in NY private schools such as Packer and Horace Mann."},{"instruction":"Where can I invest?","output":"If you intend to invest in crypto where you can earn.

Poker is a game against the other players at the table, where the casino essentially charges the players a fixed percentage to play (ie the casino has no stake in the outcome), which leaves Blackjack as the only truly “winnable” game in the casino.

Let’s look at their individual powers in the order Thanos acquired them: Power Stone Unlike other people’s answers, I think this could be really useful. Having a fight with someone? Just knock them a few meters back! Too lazy to open a can of Coke? Just pop it! Or maybe you wanna do a party trick? You can bend a metal pole! These are just some of the uses, so the Power Stone would be useful. Space Stone This is sometimes considered the weakest Infinity Stone as it can only teleport you. But think again after remembering Captain America: First Avenger. Yes that’s right, you can turn it into a cannon of doom. Or two. Or ten. Or a thousand. This means that it can be used for destruction as well as movement. Also you have telekinesis and phasing as seen in the end battle of Infinity War when the Hulkbuster was attacking Thanos; but there isn’t much else to it, so I’ll pass on this one. Reality Stone This is possibly the most powerful Stone, as you can change reality. But there is one thing keeping me from this stone: time of effect. As you can see in Infinity War, when Thanos leaves the Guardians of the Galaxy after turning them to shreds and legos, they turn back. This may have been Thanos’s choice, but I think that if you aren’t close to the area you changed it turns back. This stone can do anything, but everything will soon turn back. So I say nah to this one. Soul Stone This one is tricky. Not many people know this, but in Infinity War during the fight scene on Titan when Doctor Strange makes clones of himself, Thanos destroys the clones and blasts Strange into his Astral Form (presumably his soul flies out of his body). He used the Power, Reality and Soul Stones during the scene. He uses the Power Stone and Reality Stone to get rid of the clones, and puts Strange into his Astral form using the Soul Stone. Considering it can only do this, it is useful anyway, but it lacks uses. I’d leave this one on Vormir. Time Stone This is (in my opinion) one of the most powerful stones, as you can mess with time. Doing a maths test? Just stop time and find the answer sheet and take it to your desk. Rip it apart, and reverse it when you need answers! How about infinite treats? Just eat them and leave the wrapper and reverse time. INFINITE CANDY! Don’t want to be fat? Put your belly back in time before you were fat and bam, you are fit. Annoyed with someone? Put them in a time loop until you forgive them. This is a really useful feature, to mess with time. Mind Stone Now this is what I want. Just look at its abilities! You can phase through walls and shoot energy beams, fly (Civil War), control people’s minds (Avengers) and even give people (or yourself, if you’re greedy) epic powers like Super-Speed for Quicksilver and Telekinesis and Telepathy for Wanda (post-credit scene for Winter Soldier). Overall, this Stone is awesome. Plus, it was obvious that this is the strongest stone: just look how big it is!"},{"instruction":"What percentage of guys in the gym use steroids?","output":"you can tell by age.

[1] He is considered a pioneer of day trading [2] and was the basis for the main character of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator , a best-selling book by Edwin Lefèvre . At one time, Livermore was one of the richest people in the world; however, at the time of his suicide, he had liabilities greater than his assets. [3] In a time when accurate financial statements were rarely published, getting current stock quotes required a large operation, and market manipulation was rampant, Livermore used what is now known as technical analysis as the basis for his trades. His principles, including the effects of emotion on trading, continue to be studied. Some of Livermore's trades, such as taking short positions before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and just before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , are legendary within investing circles. Some observers have regarded Livermore as the greatest trader who ever lived, but others have regarded his legacy as a cautionary tale about the risks of leverage to seek large gains rather than a strategy focused on smaller yet more consistent returns. [4] Early life [ edit ] Livermore was born in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts , to a poverty-stricken family and moved to Acton, Massachusetts , as a child. [5] Livermore learned to read and write at the age of three-and-a-half. [6] At the age of 14, his father pulled him out of school to help with the farm; however, with his mother's blessing, Livermore ran away from home. [6] In 1891, at the age of 14, he secured employment, as a board boy, posting stock quotes at a Boston, Massachusetts, branch of Paine Webber stockbrokerage, at the rate of 5 per week. He made his first trade when he bought five shares of Burlington for 5. [7] In 1892, at the age of 15, he bet 5 on Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad at a bucket shop , a type of establishment that took leveraged bets on stock prices but did not buy or sell the stock. [1] He earned 3.12 on the 5 bet.

What many people say it takes to make money in the market is: Finding and trading an “edge” in the market —- Trading a well back-tested, successful, objective trading planWhile keeping one’s emotions in check. That’s harder to do than it first appears."},{"instruction":"Are teachers who tell students that math is racist actually hampering the future success of those students?","output":"Yes. \\"Nowhere in this document says that math is inherently racist,\\" she said. \\"It's how math is used as a tool for oppression.\\" Oh, gee.. You know what is racist? The Social studies who came up with this statement are racist and vague. Last year, 72.9% of Seattle students of color graduated on time, compared with 87.9% of white students, according to annual statistics from the state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. Students of color, particularly Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, black/African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native students, also performed significantly worse in math and English than their white peers. So, because of this, math is racist. People should try to understand that maybe poverty, ghetto culture and probably also not well trained teachers are pulling children down. Anyway, this is the book: [LINKED_TEXT: A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction Dismantling Racism in Mathematics Instruction Exercises for educators to reflect on their own biases to transform their instructional practicehttps://equitablemath.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/1_STRIDE1.pdf] [URL: https://equitablemath.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/1_STRIDE1.pdf]Probably you can find something good out of the book, but It starts with the usual agenda, dismantling white supremacy in teaching maths. I don’t know man… I know that 25% of students admitted to Harvard are Asians. This white supremacy looks like it favoured Asians more than whites. How the f*ck is that white supremacy? Anyway, at a first glance it looks vague, and statements like these are trying to reflect the “white supremacy” in teaching math: “real-world math is valued over math in the real world.” Uhmmm, what? The Math in the real world… I mean like for example the math used to built the computer and software for these people to write this book is too complexed for a 5-th grader, so maybe they should stick to fractions and simple real-world problems with cross multiplications for now.“math is taught in a linear fashion” . Well you can’t teach derivatives and integrals before teaching sequences and limits…“Rigor is expressed only in difficulty”. Uhm, no? The Pitagora theorem is not that difficult to apply or prove yet it is rigorous.“Grading practices are focused on lack on knowledge”. It is also focused on what you know? It you don’t know entirely what’s on the test, it is very obvious that you don’t get the maximum grade.“the focus is on getting the right answer”. Uhm, yeah, if you don’t like it, study something else.“Students are required to show their work”. yeah, so? Laziness is not a virtue.“independent practice is valued over teamwork or collaboration” You know, when you are searching for a theorem or for an equation you will find for example Euler’s formula, Stokes’ theorem, Leibniz Integral rule etc. They are called like that because these guys kinda worked independently. Of course, in academia there are multiple authors on articles and teamwork is valuable indeed. But you know what will happen in high-school? One or two people in the team will work their a** off and the rest will slack off and get the same grade as the other two."},{"instruction":"Was Santa ever skinny?","output":"When he was Father Christmas I suppose he was skinny.

He knows everything, there is nothing that he cannot “recognize”. The stories from Puranas are misquoted or half quoted by modern authors or TV serial makers. Let us see what Ramacharitha says about meeting between Rama and Parashurama. - There was a demon named Athula who had got a boon from Bramha that he(Athula) will meet his end only if Lord Vishnu faces defeat. -If it is possible for someone to defeat Vishnu, it is Vishnu himself. That too He doesn’t actually get defeated, but creates an “impression” that he is defeated -So both Rama and Parashurama enact a fight, and Parashurama who was none other than Vishnu himself “acts” as defeated, and subsequently Atula gets turned into Ashes. -Hence the war between Rama and Parashurama is a PLAY ACT to kill Athula while respecting the boon bestowed upon him by Bramha."},{"instruction":"w does a visually impaired computer programmer program?","output":"Around 2004, I worked with a blind programmer, David, who was just amazing as a person, a programmer, and I later discovered he's part of a rock band where he plays a few instruments (including piano and guitar), singer, songwriter, and studio engineer. Except for having a Braille printer attached to his PC, and text-to-speech software that read stuff out to him when he so chose, here's a few things about David: Amazing memory. Shortly after I met him, he and I had to attend a meeting in the Johannesburg CBD (17 KM away from our Randburg office). Johannesburg is a very busy city with many one-way streets. I drove and he guided me thru the most efficient routes (from the passenger seat). He knew Joburg really well so he directed me from Randburg, all the way into the basement parking lot's entrance. Probably not a big deal but I was blown away. He knew himself really well: We were late for that meeting so we had to hurry. When we got off the car, I unwittingly wanted to hold his hand and patiently lead the way. He politely asked to rather hold on to MY hand and told me to walk as I normally do. When we got to the security reception (where everyone's required to sign in) I knew what I was gonna do: slip a pen into his right hand and guide it to the dotted line. David politely asked me to place his LEFT thumb on the dotted line and he did the rest. I know my answer is tangential and probably not what you were looking for but like the guy [LINKED_TEXT: Tony Li] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Tony-Li-19] describes, David was a senior programmer and really wasn't disabled. We worked for a bank and he was allocated to projects as one of the senior developers. You never felt like you needed to treat him with kids' gloves or anything like that - he was a solid dev. He knew his stuff really well and most importantly (for me), he was a hell of a kind guy who was patient with junior guys, had a great sense of humour, and was totally self-reliant. This guy gave me an impression that he was more able-bodied than most sighted people. Taught me a hell of a lot in a short space of time."},{"instruction":"Does Uber charge more for two people riding together?","output":"I don’t think so.

Why or why not?","output":"Nope. This is the same concept as God. First of all, after reading many answers I came to the conclusion that “There is no perfect Definition of Karma” It’s vary from person to person depending upon their experiences. What is Karma? (Google definition) (in Hinduism and Buddhism) the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence is viewed as deciding their fate in future existences. Let’s break down it into two parts: 1st part: The fate of a person is being decided by his actions in this life and his past life. How could a person's past life affect his present life? Isn’t it Nonsense? There is no past life. It’s just garbage created by so-called ******. When they don’t have answers and they automatically bring the concept called “Past Actions” How foolish it is to believe such lame concepts. How could a person's past deeds affect life actions affect his present life? There is truth in it. We should accept it. But, doesn’t happen to everyone? Nope. If we do good deeds they will reciprocate. It’s true up to some extent. But at the end of the day, humans are humans. (I will write about it in the next paragraph.) 2nd Part: Decides fate in future existences? Another foolish concept like Past life. (Image source: Google) Does Karma happen to everyone? Osama Bin Laden, a heinous terrorist, died at the age of 55 happily (a single headshot). Do you think it’s karma? If yes, Then answer this A good and beautiful lady was attacked with Acid by her boyfriend as she wasn’t accepting his love. Is it Karma? What’s the mistake done by her? Does she deserve this? or Children being born to Alcoholic, Abusive, Non-concerned fathers. What do you say? or A person helped his friend in need but later one ditched him when he needs help. Now?? Conclusion: If any good happens to good ones, there is God. If bad happens, nobody questions God. Nobody is there to answer. If bad things happen to bad people, Karma does exist. If bad things happen to good people, No one mentions Karma. Now also, there is No one to answer. That’s why karma is a similar concept to God. Vary from one to one. Once you accept “Good and bad events happen to everybody and part of life”, then there is no point in believing concepts like “Karma & God” “If you are good, there are high chances of life being good to you”. That’s the simple funda of life.

For me, I'd have to say The Joker, Scar ([LINKED_TEXT: Anirban Chatterjee] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Anirban-Chatterjee-6]), or Dr. Doom. Many \\"villains\\" in comic books (both Marvel and DC) are actually slightly sympathetic if you get right down to it. Sure, Galactus straight up eats planets and drives millions of species to extinction...but if he didn't, he'd starve to death. He's so powerful and large that only the life force/potential energy of an entire planet will sustain him for any real period of time. Sure, Thanos wants to wipe out nearly every living thing in the universe...but he does it for love (I know, I know, but it still isn't just \\"I want to destroy the universe for the luls\\"). He fell in love with Death herself, who won't give him the time of day. So he devotes his life to getting Death to notice him. Then we get to the 3 I mentioned. The Joker...has no goals, really. Its nearly impossible to be sympathetic with him. Sure, he's insane, and our society draws a line between sane murders and insane murders...but over the years the Joker has had DOZENS of chances to \\"get help\\" or simply STOP BEING EVIL AS SHIT and he hasn't taken them. He doesn't want money, he doesn't want power...he just wants to watch the world burn and make Batman suffer for DARING to suggest that the world isn't a huge, sadistic joke. To me, The Joker is the \\"correct\\" answer - he's evil in its purest form. Because honestly...he's wackadoodle, but he's not THAT crazy. A truly batshit insane person completely unable to control themselves would not be able to create the devious plots he does. The Joker WANTS to be insane. The Joker IS insanity. As for Scar and Dr. Doom, they definitely have to get honorable mentions. They're both beings who cause untold destruction just for personal gain.

Already in the years leading up to World War I, Cadillacs were known as America's most elegant automobiles, and their fame had spread even abroad. Few have stayed true to original intentions and tradition like the Cadillac. His name is still important, despite numerous attempts by other companies to dispute his supremacy. Cadillac was the name of an officer in the French army, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who in 1701 founded the city of Detroit, an important center for the fur trade. Later he received from his king, Louis XVI, honors and privileges which served to make one forget his obscure and rather dubious origins in a small town in Gascony. Still, the Cadillac family could boast of an authentic coat of arms dating back to the 12th century, which was adopted as a distinctive emblem by Cadillac automobiles, the only North American brand that can bear a true emblem of nobility. Naturally, Antoine Cadillac arrived in Detroit 2 centuries early in order to found an automobile industry. The choice of name was made in 1902 by a wealthy lumber merchant, William H. Murphy. Some years before, he had helped the young Henry Ford to establish a factory for the production of automobiles designed by Ford himself, but differences of opinion had forced the latter to resign. At this time Murphy considered liquidating the company and turned to his usual engine supplier, Leland & Faulconer Manufacturing of Detroit, for appraisal. This company was run by Henry Martyn Leland, a man of unusual ability and cultivator of exact works, who had trained in an arms factory. Born in Vermont in 1843, Leland was still farsighted enough to suggest to Murphy that he continue production of his automobile, using the horizontal single-cylinder engine designed by Alanson P.

For one, they tend to avoid “streaks” of having the same number multiple times in a row, a lot more than random chance would. For example, if you generate 1000 digits (numbers from 0 to 9), you should have about 10 occurrences of a triplet (three times the same digit in a row)."},{"instruction":"w does the Canadian healthcare system prevent people from going to the doctor excessively when they aren't sick, with no copays and deductibles?","output":"Eventually the doctor in question would simply stop taking appointments — or set the next appointment for ‘a month or two from how’.

If you were to film any basic physics phenomenon, you could run it backwards and not be able to tell it is reversed. In general physics laws don't care about the direction of time at all. For example the earth moving around the sun. If we reverse time, we simply go around the other way, but we won't suddenly go in squares or anything. As far as I know, there is only one thing that mucks it up a little. It's because of statistics, because of the tendency of energy to mix. Take for example a block of ice on the stove. If you turn on the stove it will become hot and the ice will melt. But you will never see a puddle of water on a stove suddenly freeze while the stove becomes hot. But this wouldn't violate any laws! It just statistically never happens. As far as I know, this is the only thing that cannot be reversed. You cannot \\"unmix\\" energy. You can only run things if there is an unbalance in energy. So more accurately: You can never create more useful energy than useless energy. And the amount of useless energy will always increase. This is really the crux, because turning back time violates this law, so we believe this is why time runs forwards only."},{"instruction":"Why do we always put a Bourdon tube pressure gauge on the top of a pipe to measure pressure?","output":"Do we?

Can anyone do something similar these days?","output":"It’s possible, but you have to remember that Abraham Lincoln was an exceptionally intelligent person. And also that such feats were probably easier in the 19th Century than they are now. If you’re very gifted in a particular subject, and if you take the time to teach it to yourself over several years’ time, then it’s possible that you could become proficient at it. And that you MIGHT manage to make a successful career out of it. It’s still possible. I was recently reading about how they finally caught the Golden State Killer some 30–50 years after his evil crimes. It turns out that a woman named Barbara Rae-Venter was instrumental in developing the DNA database and analysis methods that would eventually prove that the Golden State Killer was a (despicable) man named James Joseph DeAngelo. I remember being a bit shocked to find out that Ms. Rae-Venter is not a doctor or biologist, had no formal medical training, and has no college or graduate degrees in biology, genetics, or the like. But none of that is meant as an insult against Ms. Rae-Venter. Quite to the contrary, I can only conclude that she is highly intelligent and had a natural affinity for things like genetics and data analysis. She clearly played a big role in identifying the scumbag Joseph James DeAngelo, and if she could do that with no formal training in biology or medicine, then she must be a pretty damn smart person. It is rare that someone with no formal training achieves that much success, but it’s still possible if you’re extremely talented in the field of question, as Ms. Rae-Venter must’ve been. But my favorite example of self-taught brilliance is none other than the Beatles. (I’m a big Beatle fan.) I played the piano throughout my childhood and adolescence, because my mother used to be a nearly-professional classical piano player (she has a degree from Julliard, LOL), and she wanted her children to know music too. I was taught as a child how to read music. And as a teen, I was taught the basics of subjects like the history of music and music theory. And by the time I had finished high school, I had learned to play some advanced piano music by composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Rachmaninov, Chopin, Bach, and Schumann. But not a single Beatle had ANY of that. None of the Beatles knew how to read music. None of them had any formal training in music theory or music history. None except Paul had ever even taken music lessons, and even Paul didn’t take them for very long, and never learned how to read music. The Beatles did it all from sheer talent. And that’s kind of, like, AMAZING. I’m a huge Beatles fan, and I think the Beatles composed a large volume of well-written musical compositions. Even classical musicians like my mom enjoy and appreciate the Beatles’ music. I listen to Beatles songs pretty much every day, as I have for the last 20 years or so. I always enjoy them. I think some of the Beatles’ songs are legit MASTERPIECES, such as “Eleanor Rigby”, “Something”, “Strawberry Fields Forever”, “Penny Lane”, and “Here, There, and Everywhere”. It’s amazing that those masterpieces were composed by four guys who didn’t even know how to read music. I had way more musical training than any of the Beatles did, but no way in hell could I ever compose something like “Here, There, and Everywhere”. I don’t have enough talent to do THAT. But cases like the Beatles are very rare. The vast majority of people with zero musical training will NOT be able to compose music as well as the Beatles did. The Rolling Stones also had no musical training, and, come on, we all know Jagger & Co. didn’t have one tenth of the musical talent that Lennon & McCartney had. Their best song, musically speaking, was probably “Ruby Tuesday”, but that’s only one song, it’s not a true *masterpiece*, and the majority of their other songs sucked. Most self-taught, untrained musicians will end up being more like The Rolling Stones than the Beatles. The Beatles just happened to have exceptional talent. In fact, I think it’s a lovely coincidence that three different guys with immense musical talent just happened to live in the same city and attend the same high school at the same time - and quickly bonded with each other over music. That’s how the Beatles started. I’m referring to John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. Sorry, Ringo - you got dissed again. But I am straying off topic. I feel like the subject of philosophy is the one, big exception to the rule. You can discover valuable philosophical truths even if you had zero training - it’s not so rare as it is in other fields. Because philosophy is such a vague and abstract and heavily-debatable subject, I feel like a great many people could derive valuable insights about it, even if they never took any classes in philosophy, even if they’ve never heard of Immanuel Kant or John Stuart Mill. But that’s only because philosophy is such an introspective and confusing subject, where even the experts disagree about everything, and where nothing can really be PROVEN correct. Anyway, in conclusion …….. It IS still possible to achieve success in a field in which you were only self-taught. BUT that can only happen if you happen to have great talent for that field ……… or if it’s in a very abstract and nebulous field like philosophy, where ANYone has the right to participate. In most cases, especially in the modern world, your chances of success in a field are very slim when you DIDN’T have any formal training in it. *** EDIT: It looks like I may have misunderstood your question. I thought you meant, “Is it possible for someone to be gifted enough that they achieve massive success in a field even when they had no formal training in that field?” But now it seems more likely to me that you really meant, “Will they ALLOW you to begin a career in a field when you have no formal degree in that field?” Well, if that’s what you meant, then I don’t really know the answer. Sorry - I wrote all that crap, and I probably wasn’t even answering the correct question.

Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable?","output":"Hey I don’t know how it is now. But in 1999, I went to Denison University in Granville, OH for a school trip. I was invited there for “students of color” invitational weekend. Normally, on these trips prospective students of color are matched with current students of color to experience “campus life” for the weekend. We arrived on a Thursday. I should have been leery when I was matched with a white girl. She was cool—and I didn’t have problems with her at all— but it was a clear sign of the people of color deficit on the campus. (I probably should have been leery when we shared the highway with a gazillion tractors on the way—but that might be normal in a lot of places. I’m definitely a city girl). We went to the dining hall and looked around a bit. I saw they had a really cool theater and a performance that evening. I asked if that was something we could do. At first she enthusiastically responded affirmatively. But, after a minute, she stuttered out my new reality for the weekend. The show started at 7pm. Precisely when I should be back in the dorms. I was so confused… curfew at college? I didn’t have a curfew at home! When we got back to her room, we found the two people of color on the campus. One was a Latina girl and the other a Black girl. I came to find out that both were there on such a scholarship that they were being paid to attend the school; not a small amount either. Their expenses were covered and they were given a sizable living stipend (read: 35k salary). I was incredulous. I almost wanted in on that alone! Yet, both were transferring out at the end of the semester. Why? I asked. They explained how they felt like prisoners at the school. And how every night the KKK would literally ride across the campus on horseback and “clear the grounds.” They had been warned not to be outside when this happened. That night, I saw this happen myself. I was horrified. I couldn’t imagine this as my reality for the next years of my life. I felt bad for the girls. I called home and asked my mom to come get me. She did not. She told me it was a life lesson in how so many people live. It is one that has stuck with me for nearly 20 years. It is, sadly, a memory that has been conjured time and time again over the last couple of years. *************************************************** UPDATE: Thank you for the overwhelming support. It means a lot to know this is not how people feel. There are those who don’t believe me and have tried to put up stats or whatever to challenge my experience. Don’t. I am tired of people telling me what has and hasn’t occurred in my life. You have not walked a single moment in this body and I don’t think you would survive if you were to try. In my relatively short life, I have seen more, experienced more, and done more than most people do in a lifetime. And that’s not a totally positive statement. That includes surviving ovarian cancer, seven pregnancies with only 2 live birth (including 2 still births), growing up in an abusive environment, living in shelters, serving in the military—and being raped while serving…I could go on and on. I’m not complaining; I am who I am today because of what I have been through. But, this experience at Denison is not something I need to fabricate. It’s not even the most pivotal moment in my life.1999 seems like yesterday but it was almost 20 years ago.

I believe the United States has several options here: The passports of returning ISIS fighters could be cancelled. This prohibits them from entering the country. This seems appealing because it eliminates the issue of having radicalized individuals in the U.S. who may still advocate violence here as a means of pursing their extremist view of Islam. It punishes them for any laws they may have broken when they joined a declared enemy of the U.S., and it is cost-effective as it eliminates any need for continued surveillance of these people, thus no costs are incurred. The first problem I see with this approach is that our intelligence apparatus loses an opportunity to gain further insight on ISIS and its operations. Returnees could be used to help dissuade others from subscribing to Jihadist ideology and joining ISIS-like groups. Perhaps just as importantly, it would send a message to all Americans that the government is not discriminating against them based on their ethnicity. Incarceration. Returning ISIS fighters could be treated as criminals, prosecuted under state and/or federal statutes, and imprisoned. This would give notice that the United States holds all its people accountable for their actions. While incarcerated, jihadists would be unable to carry out any attacks on American soil. The obvious detriment here is that we contribute to an already divisive and corrosive prison population. Incarceration would encourage extremist views, and foster alliances that, once out of prison, may result in domestic terror attacks. The cost of surveillance once these jihadists and their incarcerated cohorts are released could be very prohibitive. Specialized rehabilitation programs. This approach is currently being debated in India and is being employed in Aarhus, Denmark. This approach focuses on providing former radicalized fighters the opportunity to reintegrate with mainstream society. It is a multi-service approach involving social services, education, health care, and law enforcement. The program’s intention is to distance youth from the ideology of Islamic extremism through the use of mentors and support groups.[1] The disadvantages of this program are significant. The approach can fail, leaving the former ISIS fighters even more embittered than upon their return. The jihadists may increase their efforts to engage in domestic terrorism, employing lessons learned in the Middle East. It could also encourage non-American jihadists to seek asylum here to undergo rehabilitation. I hope this answers your question.

This took place not in a typical location that homeless people work, so that alone was unusual. A homeless young man got my attention as I was leaving a fabric store wanting to wash my car windows to try and raise some money. He said it was his birthday and he was trying to raise enough money to share a room with a friend for the night. He said he only needed 14 more dollars. I had just had the car washed so I declined. He looked so sad, so I gave him the only dollar bill that I had. A neighbor was with me and after he walked away, I felt really bad. So I dug a little further and found a 5 bill. I told her to watch for him as he couldn’t have gotten far. I drove slow looking for him and found him. When I drove up to him to give him the money, unbeknownst to me, my neighbor had also added 5. She handed it to him and said that now he would only need a little more. He started to cry and it was obviously very sincere. I wish I could have helped more, but that show of appreciation still makes me tear up just thinking about him. We have a fairly significant homeless population here. But NEVER has anyone asked for help for something for a birthday.

Answer to this query is load is referred in terms of current. Since at distribution end the appliances are connected in parallel. Therefore the overall resistance decreases and hence by ohm's law i.e. V=IR the current increases as voltage is kept constant. And hence current supplied from transmission system to distribution is high. Further at generating station the power output also needs to be maintained, this rise in current demands more power which is not allowed as power input is kept constant at generator station. Therefore rise in current occurs on expense of the fall in voltage and hence the voltage level falls down."},{"instruction":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","output":"Haggis with mashed turnip and potatoes.

If you travel to Azerbaijan you can see brunette, blonde, dark and light skinned Azerbaijanis. We Azerbaijanis do not deny our Iranian roots alongside our Caucasian and Turkic roots. There are several reasons why Azerbaijanis are inclined towards Turkey not to Iran. Those are the followings: Language. There is almost no barrier in communicating with people from Turkey as Turkish and Azerbaijani languages are very close to each other. Unfortunately it is not the case with Farsi/Persian as very few Azerbaijanis speak Persian because Azerbaijani and Persian are different languages.

Azerbaijanis live in a secular country and there would be very few Azerbaijanis that would like to live in a conservative Islamic radical shia muslim country. on the contrary, Turkey is like Azerbaijan a secular muslim country. Therefore, Azerbaijanis feel comfortable in Turkey rather than in Iran.Majority of Persians consider themselves superior than Azerbaijanis (whether in Iranian Azerbaijan or the Republic of Azerbaijan) and this discriminatory attitude does not go well with Azerbaijanis considering Azerbaijanis have lived in a multiethnic society since 1828. When we speak with Turks they say “kardeş/brother Azerbaycan” to us while when we speak to Persians (not Iranians) they say “Azerbaijan is our lost territories” which has indirect territorial claims and independence of Azerbaijan.Unfortunately, majority of Persians/Iranians are not happy how Azerbaijan develops while Iran goes backwards due to sanctions and radical shia Islam while Turks happy to see how Azerbaijan grows and how liberated his lands.In social media including Quora I have not seen any positive remarks towards Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis coming from Iranians/Persians (except some Iranian Azerbaijanis). Instead I keep seeing support to Armenia and Armenians rather to their shia muslim Azerbaijanis. Considering Iran and Azerbaijan are two only majority shia muslim countries in the world.Instead of sharing common history (Sefevids, Afshars, Qajars etc), literature (Nizami Ganjavi), religion (shia mosques) I keep hearing not positive information from Iranian/Persians such as Nizami Ganjavi was Persian nothing to do with Azerbaijan, renovating and renaming shia Azerbaijani mosques in Yerevan, Armenia or in Shusha as a Persian mosque which disappoints me and my people from Azerbaijan.Another insult is calling our country “Republic of Baku” instead of “Republic of Azerbaijan” by nationalist Iranians. This kind of attitude coming from Iranians/Persians do not bring closer Azerbaijanis and Persians. Instead, it distances them and creates more distrust. I travelled many countries and met and communicated with many various nationalities and can confidently tell you that the closest (culturally, mentally) to Azerbaijanis nations are Turks, Iranians, Italians, Armenians (from Armenia but not from diaspora), Central Asians and North Caucasians. My question is to you. Would you feel happy and comfortable to people that call you “a brother nation” or calling “Azerbaijan is our lost lands”? Persian empire has gone. It is time to forget about your lost lands instead build trust between two nations."},{"instruction":"Do you think J&K people do not consider themselves as Indian citizens?","output":"No"},{"instruction":"w is Sweden able to send almost no trash to a landfill?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: How is Sweden able to send almost no trash to a landfill ...] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-is-Sweden-able-to-send-almost-no-trash-to-a-landfill] [LINKED_TEXT: How is Sweden able to send almost no trash to a landfill?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-is-Sweden-able-to-send-almost-no-trash-to-a-landfill] [LINKED_TEXT: Sweden Sends Almost No Trash to Landfill — Beautiful News] [URL: https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/600-sweden-trash-landfill/] [LINKED_TEXT: Sweden Sends Almost No Trash to Landfill — Beautiful News] [URL: https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/600-sweden-trash-landfill]"},{"instruction":"A p inside a box can't tell the difference between acceleration and a gravitational field, but wouldn't a clock at the top of the box be out of sync with the clock at the bottom only in the gravitational field and synced under acceleration?","output":"If you are out of the box the clocks will be show the same time you calc for p to get to the bottom.

He showed his rough side to Greece, he supports islamic propaganda and openly challenges usa, he again converted haia sophia to a mosque again and he is planning to move his capital to constantinople again. Erdogan already destroyed kemal ataturk’s legacy of turkey and if these reasons are not good enough then for ur kind info he is dreaming of creating ottoman empire 2.0 and this time aming for going beyond europe and to islamise the world.

Some strange piece of pottery? It is so dusty, odd that I haven’t seen… Ahh! What the..? Do not be afraid. I am a genie. You rubbed my lamp. … Why is your lamp on my floor? Concern yourself not about details such as that. You get one wish. Speak. Wow, really? Hmm… Well you did not prevent it, so I would ask for more wishes, obviously. One. Wish. Fine, I get it, one wish only, jadda jadda, infinite but limited power, yeah ok. So… My wish would be this: “I wish this wish is the best possible wish I could ever make, with no bad effects afterwards, for me or any other animal, living or dead, including but not limited to: death, or injury, or insanity, or loss of consiousness, in order to to nullify or otherwise prevent this wish from being the best possible wish.” I am a genie, not a lawyer. No meta-wishes. But that is… No meta-wishes. Sigh. Fine. In that case, I should simply wish for a long and happy life, for me and for my friends and family, and by “happy” I mean that in a positive sense, and not in the “I am so happy all the puppies are being tortured” sense, and by “positive” I mean what most people would consider… Gaahh! This is complicated! Is that your wish? I grow impatient… No! I were just thinking out loud! Ok, ok, specifics. That is the key. Precise words. Ok, it is such a boring wish, but… here goes: I wish that I had a million dollars. Wait! Don’t rob a bank to get it, ok? Just sort of make the money appear, and… The deed is done. What do you mean “the deed is done?” I don’t see any money? You briefly held onto a bag with big dollar sign on it last tuesday at the tram. Remember? What? No… wait, well yeah, I remember that, but… That bag contained one million dollars in unmarked bills, with random serial numbers, impossible to track. Since you refused to accept it, I have since destroyed the bag and its contents. But… I did not know that it was mine! I thought that bag belonged to someone else! Also, when I said that I “had” a million dollars… Not my problem. Be more specific next time. You can’t just change the past and imprint memories into my brain just because I used the past tense in my wording of the… I have technically granted your wish. Good bye. Wait! Stop! What the… Sigh. Genies, eh? I should have known that the only way to win is not to make a wish. At least no one got hurt.

There is a big difference there. The human mind is directly connected to all our genetic receptors, which are not who we really are, but what we are interested in, what we are here to observe, and learn in this life. The shitshow begins when those cravings, come forth from our genetic receptors, are mistaken and believed to be who we are and what we are about, in our lives. For example, a person who thinks they lack self-esteem in their lives, which is a biochemical craving within them that comes directly from their genetic receptor‘s theme of will power, and self-worth, their mind has grown to believe this is their “mission” in life - to “get” and “find” willpower and self-esteem. A thinking that has turned into a belief system, complemented by habits, which over time becomes a behaviour that keeps them entangled in a never ending spiral, overly occupied with, believing it to be the holy-grail in their lives. As a result, their mind will always favor a decision-making strategies that will satiate their cravings, in our example, will bring them an opportunity to prove themselves. A thinking that: \\" If I do A, then I will get B. That if I do this and that it will bring forth a state of self-esteem within me.\\" As a result, it becomes the only way we know and have known to form the decision-making in our lives. Yet, when those cravings are translated and manifested into action in the form of a decision, it immediately brings forth as state of resistance in one’s life. Resistance extrapolates within our lives as all kinds of incorrect experiences, incorrect people, incorrect relationships, pain, suffering, overwhelming confusion and uncertainties, and all the rest of the spectrum of it. The accelerated decay on the body is one of my favorite examples to illustrate the ramifications of resistance and how it works within our lives, within our bodies. In other words, our decision making over time, is directly associated with the level of decay our bodies experience. We call it “aging”. The mind is the great measurer. It measures by juxtaposing one thing to another and out of that juxtaposition it derives a (relative) conclusion: A direction it thinks is the “favorable” one, relative to whatever the case may be. This is just how it works. But little does the mind know that the decision making, that the navigation in the Life, is not its job. It is here to see. The moment it assumes authority on the decision making, on the navigation in the Life, is the moment it incurs resistance on the body. Yet, completely unaware of it. It is also the moment it can no longer see as intended and as a result it only sees whatever everybody else sees. We do not have unique seeing at all because the human mind is conditioned, from early on in life, to be the authority of the decision making. It is the only thing we know. It is the only thing we deeply identify with. This is how all of us are conditioned, from the moment we come out of the womb till the moment we leave this plane. And this is not a pointing finger on anyone, and there is not a fault or blame in that. We simply do not know. That is why we only see and experience two prime perspectives that are shared by the vast majority of humanity, which mirrors the level of homogenization we are currently at. It all comes from the fact that we use our minds to impose the seeing, to impose our relative measurements, our relative conclusions on the life, and by that, create more distortion than not. Simply because the mind can never derive all the information neccessary out of any of its measurements. We are very good at that; We always impinge our mind's measurements on the Life. Always! The moment the mind is involved both in the seeing and in the decision making, is the moment it begins to lie. Because at that moment the mind will always coax the individual to take this and that direction, or to say this and that, or to omit this and that, in what it thinks will give it an advantage, in what it thinks will substantiate its angle. That is why we don’t have honest communication by human beings at all. There is no such thing! Every form of communication has an agenda that ‘runs’ underneath it. It is just how it works when the mind have become both the inner and outer authority in the life. This is where the saying of: \\"All roads to hell are filled with good intentions\\", come from. We all have our good intentions, yet in the translation of those intentions into decisions, come forth from the endless (relative) measurements our mind comes with, is the moment where distortion begins. Is the moment resistance ensues, for ourselves and for others. We are absolutely identified with our minds for whom we think we are, and for the decision making in our lives, but it is not really the full picture. Your mind is not really who you are. It's a hardest thing for the mind to accept."},{"instruction":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

Here are some steps to help you identify potential stocks: 1. Define Your Strategy: Determine whether you are focused on swing trading (shorter-term trades held for days to weeks) or positional trading (longer-term trades held for weeks to months). Clarify your risk tolerance, desired holding period, and profit targets. 2. Screen for Fundamental Criteria: Look for stocks that align with your fundamental criteria. This can include factors such as revenue growth, earnings growth, strong balance sheets, positive cash flows, and a solid business model. Utilize financial screeners or online platforms that allow you to filter stocks based on fundamental metrics. 3. Technical Analysis: Apply technical analysis techniques to identify stocks with favorable chart patterns and potential price movements. Look for stocks that exhibit clear trends, support and resistance levels, breakouts, or reversal patterns. Technical indicators like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and volume can provide additional insights. 4. Volume and Liquidity: Consider stocks with sufficient trading volume and liquidity to ensure smooth execution of trades without significant slippage. Adequate liquidity allows you to enter and exit positions more easily. 5. News and Catalysts: Stay informed about the latest news, company announcements, and market trends. Look for stocks with potential catalysts such as earnings reports, new product launches, partnerships, or industry developments. Positive news can lead to increased volatility and trading opportunities. 6. Risk Management: Prioritize risk management by setting stop-loss orders and considering position sizing based on your risk tolerance. Assess the stock's historical volatility and its potential impact on your trading strategy. 7. Research and Due Diligence: Conduct thorough research on the selected stocks. Read company financial reports, news articles, analyst opinions, and industry research. Understand the potential risks and factors that could impact the stock's performance. 8. Paper Trading and Testing: Consider using virtual or demo trading accounts to practice your trading strategy and validate its effectiveness. This allows you to gain experience without risking real capital. Remember, finding suitable stocks for swing trading and positional trading requires a combination of analysis, market knowledge, and experience. Continuously refine your approach based on market conditions and learn from both successful and unsuccessful trades. It's also advisable to seek guidance from experienced traders or financial professionals to enhance your trading skills.

Up until the middle of the 20th century, most clearly were not. Since then, gradually and very painfully, the situation has improved. To be specific, classically trained economists are not scientists, just people playing elaborate games with equations in a fantasy universe. They begin with assumptions that everyone knows are false, and then construct ever fancier mathematical \\"proofs\\" of how people and economies would behave if those assumptions were true. The fact that even their most sophisticated models rarely correspond with reality has never invalidated a single one of their \\"proofs.\\" That's not science, it's a form of academic masturbation. Until very recently, sociology was almost as bad. You could get drummed out of the profession if you insisted that human organizations, institutions, and societies were, in any sense, real. Imagine that! A field claiming to be a science that denies the existence of what it studies! One in which calling someone a \\"realist\\" was a nasty professional insult! During most of that period, the best that could be said for many sociologists was that they were honest pollsters and data analysts. Unfortunately, quite a few weren't even that. Psychology was split for quite a long time between a small band of experimental scientists and a huge tribe of practitioners who were little more than modern witch doctors, and who insisted that studying the brain had nothing to teach us about the mind. Modern neuroscience has shifted that balance quite a bit, and the effort to actually evaluate different kinds therapy and find out what works best has finally gotten some traction after having been stonewalled for over a century. From what I know of it, anthropology, which is supposedly the most observational and journalistic social science, actually has a better record than most of the others. Over the last century anthropologists have observed many cultures and human situations and have reported reasonably honestly, on the average, without outrageous amounts of theoretical or ideological bias. They've had their share of bitter theory wars, but at least they haven't let any one extremely theoretical abstract structure dictate outcomes for the whole profession. Overall, it is fair to ask several questions of a supposed science: How much predictive and explanatory power does it have?How well do its models correspond with reality?How honestly does it deal with phenomena it cannot yet explain? If the answers are \\"little, poorly, and not at all,\\" it isn't a science. If you want an example, look at education research in the US. The research literature is filled with anecdotal accounts dressed up in the language of science, with a sauce of bogus and frequently intentionally deceptive statistics; less than 5% of the papers accepted by refereed journals would meet the standards of any real scientific field; and almost none of the studies, even those with the most dramatic claims, are replicable and have been replicated in anything like a rigorous way. As a result education in the US swings perpetually from fad to counterfad to neofad, accomplishing nothing but the enrichment of the consultants and other charlatans leading each \\"movement.\\""},{"instruction":"Where can I find packers and movers in Noida?","output":"White glove packers and movers had done the shifting with care.

The Liverpool captain was brought on after Liverpool went 1-0 down and Brenden Rodgers hoped that the experienced midfielder could inspire a comeback. However, the Liverpool legend spent less than a minute in his final Liverpool vs Manchester United match, after Atkinson barely hesitated and he brandished the red card after Gerrard appeared to have stamped on Ander Herrera. The central midfielder began his rather bizarre final derby in the famed red jersey with a brutal but legal challenge on Juan Mata, who had given the Red Devils their first half lead. Gerrard got the ball a few seconds later and just as he passed it towards the flanks, Herrera attempted to win the ball back which lead to Gerrard stamping him on his leg. The Reds were down to ten men and Liverpool fought back after Mata doubled the lead through Sturridge, who managed pulled one back for Liverpool but in the end it wasn’t enough. The red card meant that Gerrard missed the league matches against both Newcastle at home and Arsenal, the FA Cup replay and lost the chance to make himself an even bigger legend in his last United Derby!"},{"instruction":"Why did Narendra Modi introduce the 2000 rupee note?

Five years ago I just turned 21, hadn't graduated college yet, and now I'm in my upper 20’s. Five years ago I placed my self worth in my future career and my social life, and today I find myself making up excuses as to why I can't stay out late. Five years ago I thought I was going to be a doctor. I also thought I was marrying a doctor. I started a job the summer I graduated college reading ECGs at a local hospital for 12 hour night shifts. I thought I would make it to med school my first year and be out of there in months. That didn't happen. I got rejected that year… and the next. My MCAT score was fine, my GPA was fine, and I learned that I wasn't that special after all. My husband decided to go into politics and now works as a zookeeper. Boy, does life change. I am so utterly thankful for rejection, and I never thought I'd ever say that. I learned to truly respect other jobs in the hospital as well as to understand how extremely important those jobs are in terms of saving lives. I learned that I know barely anything and that I have so much to learn. I learned how to make backup plans, since life doesn't magically always flow the way we want it to. There were about 4,000 other applicants to the schools I applied to, most of whom looked good on paper. Getting rejected is a part of life. I learned that it's okay to sleep in sometimes and to take a break every now and then. I learned that my husband hadn't changed a bit after all, regardless of career. I love him even more. When I finally got accepted, it was simply a new stage of my life, as my worth as a person wasn't placed in it anymore. So here is my visible transition over the course of five years: (I also have no idea why chose to write this at 3am, so please excuse the differences in photo sizes and inevitable grammar/spelling mistakes equivalent to a sleep-deprived first grader who accidentally packed a wine cooler for lunch) Here's me five years ago: Here's me five years ago with my boyfriend (now husband of three years): Here's me five years ago with my encouraging father who still believes the sun rises and shines out of my butt: Heres me four years ago: Here's me four years ago with my dad: Heres me three years ago: Heres my dad and me on my wedding day three years ago: Here’s our wedding photo three years ago that got slightly edited over time.

I look slightly older and have some smile wrinkles. My skin color the past five months, however, has changed from a sun-kissed tan to a shade of iridescent mayonnaise. I'll also mention that my body, while still young, can't do the things it used to. I had five servings of a jalapeño bean quinoa dish the other day, and was ready to donate my colon to combat chemical warfare."},{"instruction":"What are some arguments I can make to fight a fire hydrant ticket?

If you really like engineering, you will enjoy your JEE preparation. Those thick books containing thousands of numericals would give you immense pleasure. So, enjoy your preparation.Trust yourself. Know what is your true potential. Never change your study schedule only because that does not matches with that of a topper. Keep faith in your preparation.Always do what is required first. Work relentlessly but do not be too over on yourself. Play some outdoor sports once a weekend. Do not compromise on your health.Regarding relationships, I am not the right person to talk to. I have never been in a relationship till date. Finding right person is difficult nowadays so I would advice you to stay away from these things unless until that person is pure and true.Rather solving multiple books, just focus on single book and try to solve maximum content covering multiple concepts.Analyzing is as important as giving mock tests. Observe your mistakes and then try to improve yourself. Indian army also says “The more you sweat in practice ground the less you bleed in battle ground”. Lastly, I would say work for your dream so hard that at the end you should not regret that it would be better if I had worked some more.

Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie are partly responsible for today’s schooling system During the early 1900s and until the mid 1900s, John D Rockefeller donated over 180 million to Canadian and American schools and medical schools, which enabled him to infiltrate his own schooling system and medical system. This allowed him to alter the schooling systems, and bring forth systems that were geared toward Rockefeller’s monopoly of businesses, which, in turn, would generate more money and profit for his enterprises. Truth be told, it had nothing to do with a better way of teaching the Canadian and American people – it was all about producing more money for massive corporations. (Andrew Carnegie, who was extremely successful from his steel producing company, also played a vital role in this scheme to infiltrate the education system. Moreover, there were other filthy rich businessmen involved.) I’d bet you thought our schooling systems were developed by intelligent, knowledgeable individuals who put the people’s health and wellbeing first? Or, in the medical field, schools that were designed by doctors that were established and recognized for their medical achievements and other such healthcare accomplishments? No, no; that’s not the case at all: Our schooling systems (for the most part) were designed by filthy rich businessmen of the early 20th century. The systems that were assembled were geared toward producing obedient workers that didn’t argue with bosses or battle with company leaders for higher wages. They were created to enhance corporations and expand large businesses. One thing I’ve always said is “money talks and more so for people who already have invested stock.” And, regarding what took place 100 years ago to alter the schooling system, two extremely wealthy business men managed to infiltrate the education system (due to their millions of dollars) and alter it because they gave enormous grants and massive donations. I’m sure now you understand the true nature of the education system: It was designed to benefit mammoth corporations and other such colossal businesses, thereby fine-tuning people into a regiment that is parallel to the workforce. Example: People take breaks at certain times at school because of ringing bells and sometimes whistles, (close to the same as working in a plant). People adapt to a regular schedule: School starts at 8:30 AM and ends at 3:30 PM, Monday to Friday, which then – (years later, once school’s finished) – transfers to a person’s week to week work schedule. We are schooled into needing the government and enormous corporations; and, because of this, they have slowly but surely taken away the essentials of living the same way as our ancestors. A life where we the people grew farms from Mother Earth; a life where we assembled houses out of everyday things that were abundant in the area; a life where sickness was cured by making teas from tree roots, tree bark, and sometimes leaves. We are taught only what is beneficial for the government and colossal corporations, not what is beneficial for our own personal health; not what is beneficial for us living a life free from needing a grand commander, (the government). “When the government gets too big, freedom is lost. Government is supposed to be the servant. But when a government can tax the people with no limit or restraint on what the government can take, then the government has become the master.” --- Ronald Regan.

As a fitness coach who has worked with many individuals experiencing this, here's what it might be like: Morbid obesity can significantly hinder daily activities. Physical tasks, such as walking, standing for prolonged periods, or even bending over, can become more difficult. The increased weight puts a substantial burden on the joints, often leading to pain and discomfort. Moreover, there is a high risk of developing severe health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and more. The emotional toll of morbid obesity is often equally as challenging. Those with morbid obesity can face stigmatization and discrimination, leading to feelings of embarrassment, social isolation, and even depression. The continuous struggle with weight can also impact self-esteem and body image. Living with morbid obesity isn't easy, but there are ways to combat it: Adopting a healthy diet is crucial. It's beneficial to consult with a nutritionist or dietician who can provide a personalized meal plan. The focus should be on a balanced intake of proteins, carbohydrates, and healthy fats, while limiting sugars and processed foods. It's important to incorporate physical activity into daily routines. This doesn't necessarily mean joining a gym or doing strenuous workouts right away.

Following the Oath of Feanor, Feanor abandoned Fingolfin and his host, after sailing his own across the Sea, so Fingolfin marched his host across the Helcaraxe, the Grinding Ice in the North. This one of the greatest feats ever in Middle-Earth, though many perished in the journey. Lastly, following the Battle of Sudden Flame, Fingolfin rode North to challenge Morgoth to single battle.

Hindi has become a tool in India, it is dependent on people who use it, either to unite or to trigger. More than schools or Hindi prachar sabhas, it is Bollywood which spread Hindi throughout our country. By watching Hindi movies, we can at least understand some basic Hindi, even though we may not be able to speak Hindi fluently. When PM gives speech, most of Indians will watch it live, it will be in Hindi. Hindi is definitely a strong link language in north India, it enables people from different states to communicate with each other. To a very small extent, it is true in south India too. When north Indians joins colleges in south, initially they interact with us in Hindi, Hindi songs in college events too acts as a binding factor. Even many foreign countries use Hindi to denote India, or use Hindi to wish any occasion in India. In all these cases, Hindi actually unites us. However, there are many instances which triggers us too !!! With the strength Hindi has, many people who speak it or come from Hindi belt region has lot of superiority thinking. It is the official language of Govt of India, also the myth that it is the national language, makes them feel they are elite, they expect services in Hindi throughout India. They think Hindi is the true representation of India. If AR Rahman sings Tamil with Hindi songs in a concert in UK, they will protest against him for singing Tamil, if Rajamouli tells RRR is a Telugu film, they will troll him. Why should Hindi alone represent India on a global platform? They assume that to be a patriotic Indian, we need to know Hindi. They assume learning Hindi is a constitutional duty. We have seen all these either in real life or in social media. See the below tweet, even Sachin Tendulkar can't tweet anything in his mother tongue Marathi, see what reply he gets, this is not some isolated incident. It keeps on happening regularly. This is the outcome of 'national icons should always use Hindi' mindset. As they imagine only Hindi can represent India. I have seen my friends (who came from north) from Engineering days, even though Kannada was a subject, they did not learn it with interest. They have studied BE here, settled here for jobs in IT companies in Bengaluru for more than 15 years, yet they do not know 15 words in Kannada. If I ask why don't you know Kannada even after spending these many years in Karnataka, there reply is do you know Hindi as you are in India. Again, this shows they think to live in India we need to know Hindi, but while staying in a particular state, no need to learn that state's language. This is one sample example, hardly 10% of them learn Kannada while staying in Bengaluru, but expect Hindi from us. Okay fine when you come here initially you can use Hindi as a bridge, we are also happy to make you feel comfortable in your language, but do not take our gesture for granted. Do not be a guest forever, learn some Kannada. Have seen many of them speaking badly with fruits/vegetable vendors for not knowing Hindi. Have witnessed many telling Hindustan main rehkar Hindi nahi aati hai kya for that poor vendor. Why should we know Hindi to stay in our own state where our ancestors have lived from thousands of years by knowing Kannada alone? We really get saddened to see our street language, our business language getting replaced by Hindi. Mumbai and Nagpur are examples, Marathi is less significant than Hindi in those cities, that's why Bengaluru is becoming too sensitive about language nowadays, already few areas in Bengaluru have become Hindi areas. We don't want whole city to become like that. Another point is Hindi might be link language in north, don't expect the same in south. Here we use mix of our languages or English as link language, it's our wish. We are more comfortable in English than Hindi as we have completed our entire studies from kindergarten to graduation in English medium, Please do not ask when you both can speak in a foreign language like English and why not in Hindi. Do not expect a Kannadiga and a Tamil to speak in Hindi, it will be in English or a mix of Kannada-Tamil. Please don't question when you can learn a foreign language, why not Hindi? Because even north Indian schools also teaches English, not any south Indian language. Coupled with this, gov of India too gives emphasis to Hindi only. Their rules for various exams favors Hindi students than others. As a result of this skewed policy, more and more Hindi speakers get jobs and as a result general public who needs to interact with these gov offices will suffer, particularly banks. I will tell my own experience, after domicile requirement was removed from Banks, many employees in our bank is from north now. They don't learn Kannada, at the same time refuse to speak English too with us, they keep on speaking in Hindi. My mother who is a commerce graduate from university of Mysore is fluent in both English and Kannada. She can understand Hindi, but can't speak. Even then bank employees won't cooperate, they insist to speak in Hindi even when we are not comfortable. To transact in our bank in our state, why do we need Hindi, this is what triggers us, this is the situation where Hindi cannot unite. In rural areas this has become very worst where farmers and villagers are not able to get their work done in banks. Actually gov of India had brought 3 language formula to solve this language issue in our diverse country, but problem was incorrect implementation by the officials. Central gov and PSU institutions in our country should follow state language, Hindi and English as per this rule. National highway boards should have signs in 3 languages as per this rule, but many times state language will be at last followed by Hindi and English or state language will be completely missed. It is the same story in many other gov institutions. Latest example for that was Shivamogga airport in Karnataka, it was inaugurated on Feb 27, 2023. It had only Hindi and English boards throughout. Not even a single board in Kannada. Now will this help us to unite or will it trigger? Only after outrage from people, they added Kannada boards, that too only for namesake in ant’s size in a corner which nobody can read clearly. What kind of respect is this towards the language of the land. 3 language formula will be reduced to 2 language formula, and always the language which is shown the door will be state language, this is the reason why people protest against Hindi imposition by gov of India. I am not attaching any photos here, it's all over internet, interested people can google it. I will end this answer with one example where we can clearly understand what is imposition, how it can trigger? Bengaluru has metro trains which is called as Namma metro (our metro in Kannada). It follows 2 languages Kannada and English, there was a furoroe as to why Hindi is not used. But how many of you know that when metro was initially introduced only Hindi and English was there and there was no Kannada. Yes, you read it right, a public transport which runs within capital city of Kannada state did not have Kannada. As usual after people's outrage Kannada was added. Then BMRCL (Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited) started using 3 languages. Since it's neither a central gov office nor a PSU, Hindi need not be present there. Yet, it was included. Nobody had anything against it. But the problem started when central gov started poking its nose into Namma metro. They ordered every metro in every non Hindi speaking state should definitely use Hindi with state language and English. How can they do this? Under which act? How can 3 language formula be implemented in a metro system which runs within a city? It do not fall under union or concurrent list. How can they apply this rule when it's not a central gov office like Income Tax or Passport office or a PSU like HAL, BEL, ISRO, etc. This was the first step. Karnataka gov did not like this rule and they responded saying this 3 language formula is not applicable to metro which is built as a PPP model. It did not stop there, central gov sent a Hindi officer to inspect Namma metro. Yes, they sent a Hindi officer !!! What work does he have in metro ? Is he a structural engineer or a civil engineer or what qualifications does he have to inspect metro? This is nothing but gov of India going out of its jurisdiction to implement a rule which is ideally not applicable as per the act. They tried to force Hindi on a transport system within Bengaluru city just because Central gov also funded the project. Karnataka gov again dashed a letter to center and said we cannot accept this rule and ordered BMRCL to remove Hindi. As a result, BMRCL has to follow only Kannada and English. There was outrage from many people from north, many Hindi speakers. How can Hindi be not available in metro? It has to be there, what about people knowing only Hindi who come from north, how will they travel in metro? They started asking all sorts of questions. But have we ever seen them bothering about non Hindi speakers, how will a person knowing only Kannada/Tamil/Odiya travel in Delhi metro, okay leave metro, what about our languages missing in banks, etc. in our own state, won't these people who ask for Hindi in non Hindi states understand our pain, what we go through in day to day life, you never ask to include Kannada in banks in Karnataka, but want Hindi in metro in Bengaluru. In this case it will not unite, rather will trigger. Other south Indians staying in Bengaluru from many centuries have never asked for their languages in metro or city buses or Bengaluru corporation, why Hindi alone needs some special position which is not given to any other languages. In fact, in Bengaluru, Hindi do not even come under top 5 most spoken languages. Kannada, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam will be top 5, then comes Hindi, Marathi, etc. SO yeah, Hindi can be used to trigger or it can be used to unite, it lies in people's hands, do not use it to impose, rather use it to connect or break the initial barrier. It will help us."},{"instruction":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","output":"One Christmas card from the veterans."},{"instruction":"Why are the Kardashians so popular?

How they do it is they act as proprietary trading firms, they take investor capital and then pass it to third party traders, neither the investors know this and nor do the traders, they mostly act as middle men to the whole transaction, but there is a material problem. This entire structure causes whipsaws in Net Asset Value For example the last one I managed to get out of them numbers from 90%pa down to 30%pa, at which point it all unraveled because the suddenly understood they should not have given those numbers out, but there’s an interesting fact about it, almost all these ‘funds but not funds’ are based in jurisdictions such as Cayman, BVI, Bahamas. Now I was called in to incubate an accredited hedge fund which was also being formed in Cayman, did my job and generated 50% per quarter, where we found out they were trying to use our architecture to commingle investor funds so we put a stop to it and there you have the problem, we could not understand how the regulators allowed the fund to form. With Crypto at 85%pa and Accredited at 18%pa if that fund is in one of these jurisdictions they turn a ‘blind eye’ to investor capital protection, to whipsaws, and there seem to be very few that do not run that way because I speak to a lot of them, now these are at the top of the food chain in fund management, at least this is why people are investing their billions with them, except they do not have the stability over the medium to long term because they launch their funds non-transparently such as using third parties and the investors will never know. What are the best ways to invest money, honestly I thought these regulated firms have some level of fallback and standards but after speaking with them directly and asking all the questions investors wouldn’t, it turns out they just do not work, the best way is to own a private Family Office and invest 20% of your net worth in that, no matter how little or how much, we even have mentoring programmes on our architecture allowing people to do just this, the markets will dictate you receive at best a 7–10%pa return on capital which barely covers inflation, any loss and it becomes permanent, unless you are controlling the decisions yourself there is no best way to invest money, only least worst."},{"instruction":"Which Disney / TV Show characters do you think fits with certain KPOP idols (example: Jimin as Prince Eric) and could you add an explanation as to why you think so?","output":"It’s the universe’s calling that I stumbled upon this question because I have a long list for stray kids 😌💁🏻‍♀️ felix as hoe-rora bang chan as young merida because he’s only fOIve hyunjin as aunt edna lee know as princess belle because he’s literally the prettiest han jisung as han’s horse seungmin as rapunzel changbin as ralph because hes so buff and smexy 🤤 last but not the least, jeongin as bruce because i just know he bites people"},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee?

Ebay can be very strict when it comes to disputes and will favor the customer even if that customer is being investigated for being a scammer. A customer purchased a painting of mine a while back and I took great care in sending it to him. After receiving it he asked me for a refund which I don’t offer. There was no explanation. All of the sudden he put in a claim that the artwork was fake. I recognized his account from a similar incident with a boyfriend of mine and told ebay customer service about it. THEY TOLD ME NOT TO DO ANYTHING AND LET THEM STEP IN. Ebay sided with him and forced the return. Then ebay told me that when I get the item back to call them before opening the package. I did. I couldn’t even open the package, though, just handling the package the box that the customer returned I could hear all the glass shards. Ebay still returned the customers money! I even have photos showing that it looked like the box had been kicked, one sided of the box was never covered properly as I had sent it, the backing from the artwork had been removed, the frame was in pieces, the glass was in these thin shards I was afraid to pick up, and that what the customer sent back was unidentifiable as mine. Ebay STILL sided with the customer! I was out the money paid for the painting and all shipping costs. Plus, I was out from the artwork being unsaleable.e The kicker is that Ebay then penalized me for “not cooperating with the customer” which my account never recovered from. Keep in mind that Ebay advised me of what to do all along. Additionally, they did confirmed that this customer has done the same thing in the past to other sellers. Now, once your account goes “below standard” its extremely difficult to bounce back from. Luckily, I knew that they were going to eventually ban me so I moved all my listings to another site. Right now I have my own domain name so I don’t have to deal with decisions make returns from another entity or a rating system. I avoid posting any artwork at all. Just an FYI…when you take your photos be sure to take front, back, sides, top, and bottom. The customer claimed that my artwork never had a backing, but I’m sure it did. It was a custom framework job with the label and I mentioned this in the listing. There was no proof because I forgot to include the back of the artwork in my photos. Take photos of everything conceivable angle, any labels, and anything else even if you don’t think it’s significant. Also, if there are any flaws be sure to list them in the description and take photos of those as well."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"The 'p' in the words 720p, 1080p isn't 'pixels' rather it stands for 'progressive scan'.The total pixels in a 720p video are '1280*720'=0.9 megapixels."},{"instruction":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","output":"Very old joke (1940?)

The staff at my mother-in-law’s memory care unit sat us all down and told us that if she tells us the sky is purple, that’s the color the sky is today. I get that. It’s not worth arguing about. She’s mostly beyond that now; she’s uncommunicative. She just exists. It’s heartbreaking. My mother went to assisted living three weeks after my father died, and it was a hellish three weeks for me, trying to take care of her in her home. I was recovering from surgery, she was amazingly strong. It was not a good combination. When she was accepted into a beautiful assisted living facility staffed with amazing people who made her feel safe and loved, that was a wonderful day! She was furious at me for “betraying” her and “forcing her to live in an institution.” The staff told me it would be OK, and it was. She loved it there. But “there” wasn’t always “there”. Sometimes she was at home, with Dad. Other times she was at home with her father. Still other times she was furious because “your father stayed out all night again and I know he’s with some floozy.” The staff told me not to tell her my father was dead, and I tried. Honestly I did. But someone programmed my cell phone number into the phone at Mom’s bedside and she’d call me 50 or 60 times a day, begging me to give her Dad’s phone number so she could call him up and give him a peace of her mind. Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I told her “He’s not with a floozy; he’s dead.” She was SO relieved that he was dead rather than cheating on her. That made for some mighty strange (from my end) phone conversations, especially when she called me at work. “Your father is out cheating again. He’s with that floozy.” “No, Mom.

Proteins are essential macronutrients that are crucial for building and repairing tissues, maintaining muscle mass, and supporting many functions in the body. In addition to being a great source of protein, vegetarian foods can also be lower in saturated fat and higher in fiber compared to animal-based sources of protein. This can make them a healthier choice for overall health and wellness. Here Are Top 8 Vegetarian Protein Sources Of Vegetarian Foods : 1. Lentils Lentils are a great source of plant-based protein, making them an excellent choice for vegetarians and vegans. One cup of cooked lentils provides about 18 grams of protein, along with fiber, iron, and other important nutrients. The protein in lentils is also high quality, containing all of the essential amino acids needed for the body to function properly. This makes lentils a great addition to a balanced diet for people of all dietary preferences. 2. Quinoa Quinoa is a pseudo cereal that is often considered a superfood due to its high nutrient content. It is also a great source of plant-based protein, containing all nine essential amino acids. One cup of cooked quinoa provides about 8 grams of protein, along with fiber, iron, and other important nutrients. The high-quality protein in quinoa makes it an excellent choice for vegetarians and vegans, as well as for people looking to reduce their meat intake. It is also gluten-free, making it a suitable option for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.

We agreed that I would stay home with our daughter and he would continue working. As often as we move, it just makes the most sense. Given that, my “job” is the cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. He only does the yardwork, when he's not traveling for work. That's the division of labor. The child is not a part of that. Yes, she's solely my responsibility when he's working, but we're both her parents and she needs an involved mother and father. Child-rearing is a 50/50 responsibility. So, when he gets home, it's Daddy time. I don't ask him to do a thing with cleaning the house (he does do some small things which I appreciate -clearing the table, checking his pockets before clothes go in the wash) but he will spend what time he can with his daughter. He puts her to bed most nights, they go to parks/playgrounds, he takes her to church, and this gives me time for myself. I get that those who work outside the house need a minute to decompress from the day, but a parent should want to spend time with their kids."},{"instruction":"Do nonnative users of ASL have a noticeable accent in their signing?","output":"It’s not so much a case of non-native signers having an “accent” as a case of “they all tend to make the same kinds of mistakes.” One tell-tale sign that a person isn’t fluent in ASL is when they sign with a jerky, bouncy rhythm instead of transitioning smoothly between signs. I’ll do my best to create a “written” example of what I’m talking about. Let’s use the sentence “I want a red apple.” Fluent signer: I w a n t a r e d a p p l e.Beginning signer: I … want … a … red … apple. A second consistent characteristic of non-fluent signers is poor grammar. Non-fluent signers tend to sign in English word order, omit function words, and fail to inflect their verbs. A third characteristic of non-fluent signers is imprecisely formed signs. The movements are approximate, rather than crisp, and the handshapes are overly relaxed, halfway between the correct handshape and what I call “sleeping baby hands”. A fourth characteristic of non-fluent signers is a tendency to treat ASL signs as being the equivalents of English words. They might use the same sign for both play softball and a Shakespearian play, even though the word play has different meanings in these two contexts."},{"instruction":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","output":"Narayanan Krishnan He was an award-winning chef with Taj Hotels, Bangalore and was short-listed for an elite job in Switzerland.

Some people are saying banning crackers will ruin the livelihood of hundreds of families (who work in the firework industry) because that’s the only source of their income. Agreed. If you’re that much worried about those poor people: Why don’t you buy clothes from small scale industries and avoid branded ones? Why don’t you buy organic sweets rather than foreign chocolates? Why don’t you use natural cosmetic products than the branded ones again? 2. Other section of people are saying bursting crackers damages our environment because of the pollution it causes. Agreed If you’re that much worried about pollution: Why do you even travel to the next street in your bike dude? Can’t you walk? Why do you sleep with ACs? Why not breathe the natural air outside?

Maybe Daniel Kibblesmith is an amazing writer who will perfectly capture the Gen Z zeitgeist that I am too old to grok. Book’s not out yet. Anything could happen. But I doubt it. These characters strike me as a middle-aged writer trying desperately to connect to the kids and failing miserably. They’ve somehow united the entire political spectrum against them in condemnation. They’re that tone-deaf.

Well, maybe not all the time, but I feel like it sometimes. Fake unconscious is fairly common, and can usually be “diagnosed” by detecting eye-fluttering (it's tough to keep your eyes lightly closed) or by my favorite, the arm-drop test (hold the patient's arm up and let it fall. We've all seen this on TV, the arm flopps back on the bed. Well, the trick is to hold the arm over the Faker's face. It takes real willpower to let your arm flop down across your face.). Probably my most memorable faker was a guy who came in seeking drugs. He was complaining, calmly I might add, of 10/10 lower back pain. Then the clincher, “Only Demerol works for me.” Right. I made sure that quote was documented. The doc, not being a dummy decided to work up from lighter meds and NSAIDS first. I brought him some acetaminophen. “Tylenol doesn't work for my back pain.” And of course, his pain was still 10/10 after the acetaminophen. We then offered ibuprofen which he refused because “only Demerol” works for him. He did accept ketoralac (Toradol) which also didn’t help. Finally, tired of the antics, the doc ordered a shot of Demerol and discharge after the required waiting time, and no discharge prescription. “Okay, sir. We're giving you one more medication, then letting you go,” I told him. “I have a dose of meperidine.” “I told you only Demerol works,” he insisted, again. Thirty minutes later, I was back in the room to discharge him. When I asked what his pain level was, he replied, “it’s still a ten. That new stuff didn't work any better. I told you that only Demerol works for me.” “Sir, meperidine is Demerol.” Never saw a more sheepish look as he and his wife left. And it may be sophistry, but, like most hospitals, all our meds were generic, so I didn't lie to the patient, even if he might have thought so. (Actually, I'm not sure brand-name Demerol is made anymore.)"},{"instruction":"What are the things that our brain constantly lies to us about?","output":"Your brain never lies to you.

Decibels refer to the amplitude of sound in a particular position (i.e. how loud is it). White noise is just a particular type of noise. It could exist at any decibel level, depending on what's producing it. For a waterfall, this would depend on the size of the waterfall and how close to the waterfall the measurement is taken.

Majority of rifles purchased in the US are just rifles. All single shot or semi-auto rifles. You can purchase a fully automatic rifle but you must purchase special licenses and they cost a lot of money and the rifle is very expensive as well. Alsi you will be under constant scrutiny by the ATF. Majority of Americans cannot afford or want the hassle associated with trying to purchase a fully automatic rifle. You cannot just walk into any gun store and purchase a fully automatic rifle. Assault rifle is a term the left used to scare uneducated people into believing guns are bad. A semiautomatic AR-15 .223 is no more deadly than a semiautomatic hunting rifle .308. Actually I would argue the .308 a larger more powerful round is more deadly. Just because it looks scary doesn’t mean it is. It would be like putting a spoiler, hood scope, loud muffler and big tires on my Hyundai and calling it a race car! Also I really do not understand the whole anti-gun movement at all. Majority of the mass shootings are done by illegally obtained weapons and or by people that the should have been put in the system to not be allowed to purchase a firearm. Example is the Parkland shooter. The police were at that kids house over 50 times. The entire school including students, faculty, administration knew the kid was trouble and had issues. Yet he was never entered into the do not buy system. Every week in Chicago like 10 to 15 people are killed by gun violence. I think it was 2019 or 2020 Chicago had more deaths by gun violence than the entire Iraq war. Now if you didn’t know Chicago has some of the most strictest gun laws and restrictions in our country! Now I assume you are left wing by your question. So I also assume you side with Democrats which are all for open borders and last year we had the largest number of illegal immigrants cross our border in our history! Also you are probably all for defunding police or redistribution of police budgets. Also you are probably agree with letting criminals out of prison or very light sentences by Left wing DA’s. And as a left wing person I assume you will say you support African Americans/minorities and equity. The majority of the gun violence in our country happens in their communities for what ever reason. So you are ok with letting god knows who cross our Southern border, letting criminals walk with no repercussions, letting criminals out of jail, defunding police, berated and undermining police, and you say you support African Americans and minorities? Then why in the world would you want to take away a law abiding African Americans right to defend themselves from all this? What in your mind thinks that this total contradiction in thought is ok? Shouldn’t a law abiding person living in that environment have the right to defend themselves? Do you believe that a woman being raped and murdered is morally superior to that same woman pulling out a hand gun and blowing her assailants head off? What if it was your daughter or wife? Why do you side with the criminals? Law abiding citizens are NOT the problem!

As a landlord, I have lowered the rent to retain a good tenant when the market rate for units like mine has fallen. Look at it this way. I rent out a 2 bedroom place for 1500 per month on a one year lease. One year later, the going rate for a similar place has fallen to 1400 per month so I reduce the rent to market rate. It’s really a win-win situation. My tenant doesn’t have to search for a new place and pay the expenses associated with moving. I don’t have to find a new tenant and pay the expenses and lose the revenue associated with re-renting the unit. I’m not losing any money since my rental unit is now only worth 1400 per month."},{"instruction":"it safe to apply aloe vera gel on the face overnight?","output":"Yes, it is generally safe to apply aloe vera gel on the face overnight. Aloe vera gel is known for its soothing and moisturizing properties, and many people find it beneficial for their skin. However, it's important to keep a few considerations in mind: Patch test: Before applying aloe vera gel to your entire face, it's a good idea to perform a patch test on a small area of skin. This helps ensure that you don't have an allergic reaction or skin sensitivity to the gel. Apply a small amount of gel on your inner forearm or behind your ear and observe for any adverse reactions, such as redness, itching, or irritation, for at least 24 hours. Choose pure gel: Look for aloe vera gel that is pure and free from added ingredients like fragrances, colors, or preservatives. Pure aloe vera gel is generally considered safer and less likely to cause irritation. Cleanse the skin: Before applying aloe vera gel, cleanse your face thoroughly to remove any dirt, oil, or makeup. This helps ensure better absorption and effectiveness of the gel. Amount of gel: Apply a thin layer of aloe vera gel to your face. Using too much gel can make it feel sticky or may not allow your skin to breathe properly. Individual tolerance: Everyone's skin is different, and while aloe vera gel is well-tolerated by most people, some individuals may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions. If you notice any redness, itching, or discomfort, discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional. It's also worth noting that aloe vera gel is not intended to replace a comprehensive skincare routine. It can be used as a part of your skincare regimen to provide hydration and soothing effects. If you have specific concerns about your skin or are seeking guidance on using aloe vera gel overnight, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your skin type and needs.

But he was never a “bombs on buses” terrorist. He used global blackmail. He openly announced what he was going to do if they did not give him world control, disarm nuclear weapons, give him an island to create a mutant nation, etc.,. There would be a small demonstration of power, and then the X-Men would show up and beat the crap out of him. In the old days, in the 1960’s, a couple times when he was thwarted he left a nuclear bomb behind as a booby trap. The heroes saved the day of course, but had they gone off it would have been pretty horrific. But most of his worst acts have been under declared states of war. Sinking the Soviet Sub. He was blackmailing the world to disarm their nuclear weapons and cede control to him. The Soviets fired nuclear missiles at him from a submarine. He sank the sub. They should consider themselves lucky. If a Soviet submarine had lunched nuclear warheads at the U.S. in 1979, WWIII would have occurred. The other time was when the U.N. attempted to blockade Asteroid M when Magneto declared it a sovereign state for mutants. All he did was make the announcement. The U.N. made the first aggressive move. Magneto let out an EMP to fry the satellites and it fried everything electronic on the planet. Including hospital equipment an airplanes and everywhere else human life was dependent on machines. But there was an open state of war. A lot of people like to point to Mags ripping out Logan’s adamantium as a heinous act. But frankly, that was the third time Wolverine had, or damn near had, eviscerated Magneto. That moment was Mags finally taking the gloves off. And the Logan had to go whining about it. “You tried to kill the man and he tied to kill you back. Get over it wusserine.” The one act he has never expressed regret for, that he thinks was fully justified, is committing mass murder after his daughter died. The mob saw him using his powers to get he and his wife out of a burning inn. They surrounded him and began to beat him up, not letting him go back inside to save his daughter. When her charred remains fell at his feet, he released a power surge which killed everyone within a mile of him. (The radius of his power surge has grown over the years, from just killing the mob to killing everyone within a mile of him. This actually makes sense because it explains how he would be able to get away without pursuit.) So hundreds of people who had no idea what was going on died. Mass murder. Now Magneto’s power had just emerged and he had little control in his blind rage at the death of his child, but of all the acts he regrets, he’s never expressed remorse for that. “They got what they deserved.” He has enacted revenge a couple times in very imaginative and horrific ways. [LINKED_TEXT: 10 Most Messed Up Moments In Marvel Comics] [URL: http://whatculture.com/comics/10-most-messed-up-moments-in-marvel-comics?page=3] Magneto is very clever. Not subtle, but clever. But IMO, to me, the absolute worst, inexcusable act the 616 Magneto did was to kill his own son. It’s in character because we’ve seen Magneto completely lose it on panel before (New Mutants #39, X-Men -Vol. 2 #2) when he finds out he’s been manipulated and controlled. It is a hot button guaranteed to set him off. But there is simply no way to rationalize this. Yes, he’s mad, but he is a man fully in control of his powers this time. And it’s not one outburst, it’s an extended assault. Also, the situation is fixable. Until he pushes Wanda too far by killing her brother, making him (ironically) the direct cause of “No more mutants.” It comes at the end of House of M, when Magneto realizes he’s been manipulated by his children (as if he had never done that to them), with Quicksilver as the mastermind and Wanda as the tool. He wraps up him up so Pietro can’t move and proceeds to throw massive objects at him until Pietro is dead. Wanda promptly brought him back to life, but that does not excuse the fact that Magnus beat his own son to death."},{"instruction":"f the unit exchanged at the data link level is called a frame and the unit exchanged at the network level is called a packet, do frames encapsulate packets or do packets encapsulate frames?","output":"Short answer is packet encapsulate frames.

Our metabolic machinery ADAPTED to this pattern of eating, optimizing nutrient absorption and the various hormonal feedback systems involved in digestion. It is my opinion that eating a substantial number of calories three times a day is “abnormal” from an evolutionary point of view. If I were to be right, one wonders what sorts of human diseases arose from the three times a day habit. A study done with an Amazon tribe some years ago investigated calorie requirement in a setting of consistently vigorous activity. The subjects were members of a hunter-gatherer tribe. Both men and women took part in the hunting. The conclusion - males require something less than 1900 Calories per day and women something less than 1800. Compare this with the oft-stated 2000 calorie a day diet in the USA, increasing to upwards of 2500(!!) a day if physically active. Yes, there exist inter-person metabolic variations but I’m talking baseline here.

It has been immensely helpful for many people. While there are other free on-page SEO tools like Yoast SEO and All in One SEO, I consistently prefer Rank Math. When I initially entered this field, I was confused about whether to use Rank Math or Yoast for on-page SEO. I began with Yoast SEO for my webpage's on-page SEO, but I didn't quite like it due to its complexity and outdated technology. SEO has evolved, requiring technical, off-page, and especially on-page optimization. Rank Math, with its user-friendly interface and advanced features like AI content optimization, addresses these modern needs. However, keyword implementation depends on your strategy, not solely on any SEO tool. Google Search Console and Analytics are excellent free tools that help identify issues or errors on your webpage. This allows for improvements and enhanced SERP rankings. Google Analytics provides real-time data, highlighting popular webpages and user behavior. Another valuable tool is Google's Site Kit, which combines data from Search Console, Analytics, and AdSense in one platform. Once the plugin is installed, it displays user data, site speed, user experience, and any speed-related issues. Tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush offer both free and paid features, assisting with site health and keyword research. I currently rely on free tools for my SEO, from keyword research to on-page optimization. However, for assessing keyword difficulty, I also use Ubersuggest, a paid tool.

Following is an article I’ve written that describes this non-punitive disciplinary method of parenting: “Spanking For Safety is a Risky Business I'd like to urge all parents to further ensure the safety of their children by teaching them to recognize danger on their own, without a need for anyone to stand-by at close quarters on 24-hour-a-day watchdog duty. We've sold kids short by assuming that they are incapable of learning to avoid danger independently, and we've done so at their expense...a fact which is in evidence every time we see a toddler running onto a busy road. Instead of acting as a mere external control, parents would better serve their children by simply conveying to them their own fear and avoidance of all that is dangerous. This parental conveyance enables children to internalize an awareness of the danger at hand...after all, this is how most living things quite effectively teach their young how to survive. Unfortunately, the commonly seen teaching method used by human parents to teach safety issues, which can be called, 'The Yell and Hit Method of Teaching', is a most inefficient and harsh way to teach anything, let alone safety issues. As a matter of fact, this yell and hit approach is such a poor method of teaching that it can even prove to be counter-productive on occasion. It should be apparent that the major flaw in using anger and violence as a method of teaching kids to avoid danger lies in the looming prospect of the anger and violence causing the child to fear the parent rather than the actual danger at hand. Let me explain a little about this 'conveyed fear' learning that we've left neglected and unnoticed for far too long now. It's probably safe to say that most parents are aware of the fact that even infants react instantaneously to the startled behavior of a parent. This is because babies are born into this world fully equipped to automatically shift into a survival mode of acute awareness in response to an alarm reaction on the part of the parent. As soon as the baby is capable of identifying a source of the parents' alarm, the baby will immediately adopt the same fear of the perceived threat as is held by the parent. This ability of young children to immediately internalize the same fear displayed by a parent toward a source of danger is a built-in biological survival mechanism that parents should be utilizing to a much greater extent than we do at present. This inborn learning ability in children is biologically designed to act as an aid in helping our young learn how to avoid danger.... and thereby enhance the probability of their survival. Most newborn animal species also share this inherent behaviorism. Except, unlike us, their parents take full advantage of its value in teaching survival-skills to their young. Additionally, we parents could save ourselves a great deal of worry and time by making use of this natural learning tool. It's a simple, yet proven technique that has over time shown itself to be much more effective, safe, and quick than other traditional, typically punitive, methods of teaching kids to avoid harm. This method utilizes the ability of children to internalize our conveyed fears and instantly adopt those fears as their own.... and they do so in the form of a deeply ingrained learning process that can take mere minutes to stage and complete. To illustrate how this method works, let's imagine that you are the parent of a toddler who is ready to learn to use caution when in the vicinity of moving vehicles. You might want to start by taking your toddler out by the roadside for the lesson during a period of light traffic. Begin to laugh and play while at the same time keeping an eye out for that first vehicle to come along. When one comes into view, jump in alarm with a scared 'OH! OH!', and point to the vehicle while making sure that your child is seeing the source of your alarm (rest assured that your child will be looking around for the cause of your distress). It only took one lesson to instill a sense of danger in my kids where moving vehicles are concerned, but if you see that your child is not wary of the road after the first teaching attempt, (perhaps through a failure to effectively convey your alarm) simply repeat the process until the message gets through. Few kids will remain immune to mom/dad jumping in startled alarm to a perceived threat. Needless to say, this teaching method is highly effective for teaching children any and all safety issues. The hot stove is another commonly heard excuse given by parents for exacting punitive measures upon their children. But, there's a better, faster, and safer way for new parents to address this safety issue. First, turn your stove on to a high setting and let it get good and hot. Then go on a 'play crawl' with your (say 8-10 mo.) baby into the kitchen. Crawl close enough to the stove to feel the heat, then suddenly and abruptly stop dead with a vocalized alarm. You will have instantaneously gained the undivided attention of your baby. Slowly reach your hand out toward the hot stove until the level of heat becomes uncomfortable, then pull your hand back quickly with a wide-eyed start, while fearfully saying the word, 'Hot!' Baby might take-off beating a hasty retreat at that point, but may be just as likely to instead want to learn more about this danger by mimicking what you've just done by proceeding to slowly reach toward the stove themselves. Under a watchful eye, baby feels the same discomforting heat and learns forever that a hot stove is best kept at a safe distance (of course, you will want to confirm this learning with follow-up observations under close supervision.) My daughter didn't actually have to reach out to feel the heat because she crawled close enough to feel it and identify the stove as my source of alarm. On the other hand, my son cautiously reached-out to feel the discomforting heat just as I had done. Either way, both of my kids had internalized the desire to avoid getting too close to a hot stove from that point on. This process represents a safety lesson that can be permanently learned by a baby in as little as a minute's time. As a matter of fact, I've discovered that my method is so effective that it's better for parents to be under-dramatic and find that there's a need to repeat the exercise than it is to be over-dramatic and scare the heck out of poor baby. While fear is one of the least desirable or advisable emotions to instill in a child, there are nevertheless a few fears that they need to learn in order to survive. My method involves a simple matter of some thought and creativity. Of course, childproofing is desirable, but it doesn't actually teach. For example, are all light sockets going to be covered in all places visited? Perhaps not. Crawl with baby to a light socket, stick a finger toward it, and then recoil in alarm. Crawl to the edge of steps with baby, and proceed to stop abruptly in alarm. It's certainly understandable that a parent seeing their child placed in harm's way is going to react with fear and alarm. I'd like to suggest that parents refrain from allowing their feelings of fear to develop into feelings of anger, at least where the teaching of safety issues is concerned. Anger leaves much to be desired as a teaching method and is just as likely to motivate the child to simply avoid getting caught the next time (with the child being prone to come away thinking something along the lines of, 'I don't understand what was wrong with what I was doing, but for some mysterious reason it upsets mom, so I just won't do it when she's around'). Worse yet, young children have been known to begin running away from the alarmed, angry-sounding shouts of a spanking parent through a fear of being hit. This reaction on the part of young children is especially risky near roads, parking lots, and swimming pools, where the danger lies ahead. Any parent knows that there are moments, no matter how high the usual level of their vigilance when young children are going to disappear from sight. One of the major purposes of this teaching method is to help address these potentially tragic instances by creating a greater degree of insurance against childhood accidental deaths and injuries. It's too often the case that children learn to avoid danger only in the presence of the punitive parent without an understanding of the actual risks associated with the behavior in question. Mine is a method of teaching that serves to effectively hasten the process of children internalizing an independent ability to avoid danger, while also representing a means of teaching children without subjecting them to demeaning, disrespectful, or violent treatments. Having said all that, I should also add that although this method of teaching safety issues is highly effective, it still doesn't replace the need for young children to be supervised at all times where the possibility of danger might exist. NOTE: This approach may not show itself to be immediately effective in the absence of a well-functioning bond of trust between the child and the parent/caretaker. In such cases where there exists a degree of distrust, current acrimony, or alienation between the parent and child, a repeated restaging of the lesson in question might be required.” Article Source: [LINKED_TEXT: http://EzineArticles.com/573043] [URL: http://ezinearticles.com/573043]"},{"instruction":"f you are a medical worker, have you ever experienced a patient full out faking?","output":"The worst “faking” I ever saw was when a prisoner could not get out of jail for “pain” after multiple fake illnesses to earn his chance at freedom.

LIC has new endowment plan, jeevan labh and new jeevan anand to name a few. IRR of any of these plans would hover between 5.5% to 7% depending upon age of the insured, premium paying term and policy period. Although maturity proceeds are tax free, such plans seldom generate inflation beating returns even when you stuck with them for 20–25 years of your life. Also, agents never tell you about exit clause. i.e. what would happen if you find it difficult to pay premiums after say 6 years. In that case you have to either make a policy paid up or incur heavy losses by surrendering policy. Also, you won’t get adequate risk cover. Hence, it is better to simply ignore such opaque plans which neither give you good returns nor life cover."},{"instruction":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","output":"Oh, yes, definitely!

In many cases, employers ask employees to submit a resignation letter when they want to avoid the negative implications of firing someone. By submitting a resignation letter, you are essentially quitting your job voluntarily, which can make it easier for the employer to explain your departure to others. However, it's important to understand that submitting a resignation letter in this situation may have implications for your eligibility for unemployment benefits and your ability to challenge the termination. If you submit a resignation letter, it may be more difficult to argue that you were wrongfully terminated or that you are eligible for unemployment benefits, since you voluntarily resigned.

As you probably know, the engineering field is dominated by men. There have been multiple times when I’ve been the only woman in a given meeting or work situation. I have also met one on one with many male bosses over time—-it’s part of the job. If there is any field where women would have issues, it would be a field like mine. In thirty years, I’ve never had major problems with the vast majorities of the men I’ve worked for or with. I’ve found these problems usually become an issue when a man and a woman choose to meet in places where nobody else is around. As a woman, I would not go to a hotel room with a man or anyplace else where there aren’t other people around. In thirty years of working, I have yet to come across a situation that necessitated me having to meet a man in a place as private as his hotel room alone. Most business meetings are simply not conducted that way and they don’t have to be—meeting in the lobby bar for a drink or a restaurant is usually sufficient if the two people are not in the office. If a prospective employee told me that he can’t be in a meeting with a woman in the situations I’ve described above, I’d tell him that he has just told me that he can’t do his job, and he’d probably either be fired or offered a position where he doesn’t have to meet with people (which would be a lower level position that he would likely not want). Most meetings that are between two people in my field are usually in a public space like a restaurant or a conference room/office with windows so that people can see into the room, in someone’s cubicle, or in the field where there are other people around. I have yet to be in a meeting alone with a man in a private place like someone’s hotel room or their home or their car or anywhere there weren’t other people around who could see us even if it is a meeting between the two of us. Nobody is going to force themselves on you if you are in a conference room or an office that allows people to see inside. Nobody is going to reach across a table in a crowded restaurant and fondle your boobs or your wiener over dessert. Men aren’t going to expose themselves and tell a woman to kiss it if they are in the field with hundreds of other people on the site. That simply doesn’t happen, and it’s bizarre to me that there are men that actually think a woman is going to do stuff like that in a public place or would make up a story that is easily disproved. And professional women aren’t going to go to a man’s hotel room for a meeting unless they want something to happen because there are other options for meetings that aren’t as risky if they don’t want something to happen. Men, it’s pretty simple: If a woman is willing to go to your hotel room or any other private place where it’s just the two of you to conduct a meeting, turn it down, and pick that restaurant or bar down the street to talk business. Have people around you all the time, and monitor your alcohol intake—-don’t get so piss drunk you can’t remember what happened the next day. Stick to business, and just don’t say or do anything that can be interpreted as flirting. Some women will let it go, but some may not, and you aren’t on a date anyway. Given that, I see no reason why a man cannot meet with a woman under these circumstances, and if he refused to do that, I wouldn’t tolerate it. These are low risk situations that can be managed by the two people, and you both are supposed to be intelligent adults. If you are that much of a man child where you can’t meet with a woman in an office or a public space like a restaurant or bar or on a site where there are lots of people around you, you either have a problem with working women in general or you’re just too damn dumb to figure out how to conduct businesss in a professional manner in public spaces that doesn’t put you at risk. And neither one of those is desirable to me as your potential boss, because you are saying you cannot work with me one on one. If that’s not it then you are making an excuse to not do your job so you can be a discriminating asshole. and like the above if that’s what you are you can just keep looking for a job because you won’t be working for me,"},{"instruction":"Why does the recording in GarageBand sound so bad?","output":"Microphone placement and room acoustics are the main culprits for bad sound, NOT the software. You can get decent recordings with cheap gear if you place the microphones well and have good acoustics where you’re recording. If you have hard floors, walls and ceiling you’re going to get lots of echo and bad sound. If you have your mics placed poorly you’re going to have poor sound. I’d suggest doing a bit of research on just how to set up mics for your purpose. If that still gives bad results then check your mics, cables (unlikely, usually cables are either good or gone), mixer and A/D converter. Edited to add: I’ve seen other answers about bad mics and that can be a factor, but you can get good results with cheaper microphones… while that 500 Sure is better than the 40 dynamic the cheapies I’ve used are at least adequate for most purposes. Would I use them in a sound studio? Of course not, but if you’re using consumer level software then you’re probably not in a position to be using high end microphones. My field is Video Production so Audio isn’t my primary focus but after close to 40 years I can hum the tune. I actually do use cheaper microphones for a lot of purposes and while I can tell the difference in the recording the biggest difference is in properly placing your microphones. A decent, inexpensive dynamic mic close to the instrument is much better than a 400 shotgun mic 10 feet away. After you get the mics set you’ll need to get the mix right… this is what audio guys at big venues get paid big bucks for. And not infrequently screw the pooch, we’ve all been to a live event where Captain Feedback made an appearance. Adjust the preamp to minimize the sensitivity of the microphones… you want them to hear what’s RIGHT THERE in front of them, not the other instruments or monitors a few feet away. A bad mix will destroy the sound quicker than anything else short of a power failure. Listen to each mic with the solo switch, turn the preamp down, then slowly turn it up until you hear the subject but DON’T hear anything else. Repeat this for each mic or instrument you’re recording. After the preamps are set then bring the faders up so you easily hear the channel. Repeat individually for each channel in solo then listen to all of them together and balance them against one another. This part is more art than science, and it’s what the audio tech is supposed to bring to the table. If you’re not an expert (I certainly am NOT at audio) it’ll likely take you a bit to get a decent mix. A good set of over the ear noise cancelling headphones are a godsend here; the Bose I bought 15 years ago were one of the better investments I ever made. I very rarely have to do anything complicated with audio in my business so when I do I’m not as good as an Audio Tech. There’s lots of shortcuts I’ve seen them do that for me are magic. I have to fall back on trial and error backed up by College courses back in 1984 and my years of experience in Video production watching and occasionally having to muddle my way through doing audio. That reminds me of a Wayne Newton concert I was at about 20 years ago, the audio was so bad at the start that Wayne had his own audio guy (the guy was also his main bodyguard, a HUGE man who went by the name of Bear) go to the board and physically moved the facility guy out of the way. 2 songs later the audio was perfect. Like I said, magic. I’d casually known both Wayne and Bear for years and never knew he knew sound."},{"instruction":"Can a boxer intentionally fake a knockdown to recover and prevent themselves from getting knocked out?

Pairwise addition: To begin, multiply the first and last digits together (1 + 10 = 11).Next, add the next-to-last number with the second: 2 + 9 = 11.Keep on until you get to the middle numbers: 3 + 8 = 11, 4 + 7 = 11, 5 + 6 = 11.Given that there are 5 pairs of numbers, divide the total of each pair's numbers (11) by the quantity of pairs (5): 11 x 5 = 55.As a result, 55 is the result of adding the numbers from 1 to 10. formula for an arithmetic series's total: The following formula can be used to get the sum of an arithmetic series: S is the sum, n is the number of terms, an is the first term, and l is the last term. S = (n/2)(a + l). In this instance, the number of terms is 10, the first term is 1, and the last term is 10. Fill in the formula with the values: S = (10/2)(1 + 10) = 5 x 11 = 55. Again, 55 is the result of adding the digits 1 through 10. Both approaches end in the same outcome, so you can pick the one that is more practical or simpler to utilise when using a notebook. Quickly mobile method : Simple addition of the integers from 1 to 10 completes the calculation. One number is added after another until ten is reached, counting from one. This calculation yields a result of 55. One of the fundamental mathematical operations, addition is frequently utilised in a variety of contexts, including everyday life, science, math, and finance. It enables us to combine several quantities and calculate the sum. In this instance, 55 is obtained by adding the numbers 1 through 10.

They called him a madman and didn’t listen to him. His planet died, lacking the resources to keep up the demands of the overpopulation. Thanos believed that the Universe itself was suffering from the same danger as his planet. From then on, He grew powerful and powerful taking over planet over planet and eliminating them to depopulate the overpopulated universe. He took some children from the planets he eliminated, the most famous one being Gamora, are the Children of Thanos (or) The Black order who work for him unlike Gamora. He gave them powerful weapons and strength to achieve his goal. Then he started the quest of The Infinity Stones, through which he could eliminate half of the universe with a snap. His Physical Power Thanos is powerful than any human with super strength, speed, insane stamina, powerful muscles(Defeat of Hulk). To harness the power of the Infinity stones, He went to Nidavellir to build a gaunlet to harness the massive power. This gaunlet is made from a strong metal, Uru, by Eitri. He refused, but Thanos killed everyone on the planet. After Eitri making the Gaunlet, He cut Eitri’s hands. Once the gaunlet holds the 6 Infinity Stones, it’s power is unmatchable.

Additionally, copying zip files from one system or folder to another is simple. You can open zip files on Mac and encrypt the zip files to make them more secure. Passwords can be used to secure these files. For file compression and archiving, ZIP is a commonly used compression format. By enabling the file format at the API level, macOS supports the file format and can interact with ZIP files. If you're wondering how to open zip files on a Mac, both built-in and external tools can be used. Method 1: Double-Click a Zip File on a Mac to Open It Double-clicking zip files on a Mac is the easiest way to open them. The actions to take are as follows: Step 1: Open the compressed file.Step 2: Double-click it.Step 3. This will start the Archive Utility program and unzip the files.Step 4: The zipped file and the unzipped file will both be in the same folder. Method 2: Utilize Archive Utility to open zip files on a Mac. Step 1: Right-click the zip file.Step 2: If Archive Utility is the default application, choose \\"Open\\".Step 3: If not, select \\"Open With\\" from the menu.Step 4: Choose \\"Archive Utility\\".Step 5: Tap the icons to access the files that were extracted. . Method 3. Use Decompression Utility Software There are several Decompression Utility Software solutions available. Look at the features and choose the one that best fits your needs. Some of the best zip file openers are WinZip for Mac, Better Zip, etc. Method 4. Use Terminal to View the Zip Files Take a look at these steps: Step 1: Launch Terminal. To do so, navigate to the \\"Utilities\\" folder and launch the Terminal app. Step 2: Open a command prompt and type zip info /Downloads/Archive.zip. The command zip info must be accompanied by the archive's location. Step 3: Examine the results. It may appear cluttered or convoluted, but it performs the job. If you want a better look, you can use a third-party program. Zip files are not as safe as you may believe. Data loss can occur if extra safeguards are not taken. In that case, using a reputable data recovery program is a wise decision. It is critical to ensure the security of your data.

So really, the answer is both yes and no, it just depends on your perspective of what “too big” means. We’re steering toward an inevitable evolution of open-world gameplay that resembles more of a simulation than a driven narrative, and depending on the player, that may be desirable or undesirable. I think really, they’re just a threshold of that evolution where different types of open-world games will branch off into different focuses.

It was made with Pepsi, and he managed to carry a sample out, to have it analyzed. He was an employee of Coke, and knew that establishment wasn’t on the delivery list. They took the misuse of their name to court, and won, too. I had a sip of Pepsi, once, and spit it out. I’d rather be thirsty than drink it. I liked Coke, until ‘new Coke’, and the reformulation came about. That includes using corn syrup instead of cane sugar. I quit drinking Coke. That includes ‘Classic Coke’, which was a misleading name; syrup instead if sugar, and a complete lack of the original flavoring. The “less White” policies of Woka Cola sealed it; I don’t use ANY of their products, any more. They made their decisions; I made mine. Don’t expect me to use your products while you are attacking my race as corporate policy, or even if you decide that, like ‘new Coke’, it is the wrong path. The damage has been done.

A: Within living memory, noon was the moment of meridional zenith passage of the Sun at a specified spot - on a meridian. The British had a particular interest in this instant - it formed the basis of the first accurate World navigation system. A sextant could easily establish the Sun’s Altitude at local noon, and with an Almanac, it provided immediate values for Latitude, and by reference to an accurate chronometer, it provided the Hour Angle ~ the time difference of noon with respect to the Greenwich Meridian.- and thereby the longitude of the ship. Several meridians were initially used for the reference meridian, notably the meridian through Paris, the one used to initially define the meter as a quarter circumference through this meridian was taken to be 10,000 km. The one that was soon standardized was at the location of the Naval Observatory at Greenwich near London, on the Thames. Time at this location was Greenwich Mean Time, GMT, or to airmen, ZULU time. The observatory pendulum was the reference until the twentieth century, when quartz resonators replaced pendula, and in the last half of that century, the atomic standard replaced the quartz resonator. It was not long before accurate time pieces could observe that Noon varied by a few milliseconds each day, depending on mass movement inside and above the Earth’s surface. At this point astronomical measurements were superseded by the atomic clock. Morning hours before the noon Meridional passage were marked ante meridian AM and after noon hours following it were marked Post meridian PM. Finally, the moment of noon is given as one second after 11:59: 59 AM and one second before 12:00:01 PM."},{"instruction":"What do you think about President Biden's revocation of the Keystone XL Pipeline permit?","output":"millions of wild life will survive that we’re going to die due to our uncaring desire to build the line."},{"instruction":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school?

Evaluating the impact of such programs is complicated by the fact that a highly select sample of students takes advantage of these programs. To overcome this difficulty, we exploit randomized lotteries that determine high school admission in the Chicago Public Schools. Surprisingly, we find little evidence that attending sought after programs provides any benefit on a wide variety of traditional academic measures, including standardized test scores, attendance rates, course-taking, and credit accumulation. This is true despite the fact that those students who win the lotteries attend better high schools along a number of dimensions, including higher peer achievement levels, higher peer graduation rates, and lower levels of poverty. We do, however, uncover evidence that attendance at such schools may improve a subset of non-traditional outcome measures, such as self-reported disciplinary incidences and arrest rates.http://www.nber.org/papers/w10113] [URL: http://www.nber.org/papers/w10113]"},{"instruction":"w can I become a genius like Einstein?","output":"If you want to become as famous as him,I would say just follow your passion and ride the storm....work for your chosen field without wasting a second other than your sleeping any daily needs time.

Marrow is an awesome online coaching platform for NEET PG/NExT which provides the option to purchase notes based on the video lectures. This appears to be a really good time saving option, especially for those who are in final year MB/Interns/housestaff doctors since they don't have much for the D-Day. The whole MBBS course asks you to strain yourself to the maximum limit and it also teaches you how to optimise your endeavours for the best results. Therefore, I personally feel that being in second year, one should try and make their own notes from the video lectures. And here's why I say so( which is a completely personal opinion :P) - While writing the notes on your own, you have the entire control on how you organise all the information, with what color you want to write, and how you present your complete set. Those notes really feel like you own them, and after finishing them you do get a huge satisfaction upon your efforts. (Like whenever I finish a topic, I leave a signature behind, to mark those little steps 😂) Speaking of colored notes, they provide a good visual memory. For example, while doing some topic, you find a particular mnemonics to be tricky, and thus you write that down in a bright color like orange. Hence when asked about that topic…it might suddenly strike in your mind that you wrote that information down in a specific color, which ultimately saves you in viva. This can also help in NEET PG, where you write down some MCQ points in a different color.Another advantage that I found is that suppose you are not able to understand a particular topic or you find them to be a bit incomplete, you can always pause the video, look up from a standard book and write it down in your own word.Finally, MBBS is a really expensive course. You already have brought so many books. And then you have taken an online coaching. So it might be good to save the bucks for future use. This all I can write about the pros of making your own notes. Here are some of my own notes. Finally, its your own choic😊, I just gave you the points to ponder upon…being a 2nd Year student myself. This answer is for all the students in 2nd year who are looking to buy Marrow and for the 1st year kids who are looking to take Marrow in Second Year.

With the advent of modern medicine and technology in the last half-century or so, an interesting phenomenon emerged. People who are clinically dead—no heartbeat, breathing, and most of all, brain activity—sometimes are revived. Many have extraordinary stories to tell, which are quite similar, about what happened after death. Since there is absolutely no brain function, the occurrence is not easy to scientifically explain, though scientists’ attempts grow more and more outlandish. These survivors claim to have been out of their corporeal bodies, in a different form. What is striking is how they can describe procedures done to them, conversations heard, or even events taking place in another room, all the while with zero brain function. The pioneer of NDEs or near-death experiences is Dr. Raymond Moody. His book “Life after Life” became a bestseller in 1975. Using more than one hundred case studies, unrelated and geographically separated people from all walks of life described their experience when they were clinically dead. The template for the most common elements in their descriptions is: A person is dying and as she reaches the point of greatest physical distress, she hears herself pronounced dead by her doctor. She begins to hear an uncomfortable noise like a ringing or buzzing, and at the same time feels herself moving very rapidly through a long dark tunnel. After this, she suddenly finds herself outside of her own physical body, but still in the immediate physical environment, and sees her own body from a distance, as though she is a spectator. She watches the resuscitation attempt from this unusual vantage point and is in a state of emotional upheaval. After a while, she collects herself and becomes more accustomed to her odd condition. She notices that she still has a “body,” but one of a very different nature and with very different powers than the physical body she has left behind. Soon other things begin to happen. Others come to meet and to help her. She glimpses the spirits of relatives and friends who have already died, and a loving warm spirit of a kind she has never encountered before—a being of light—appears before her. This being asks her a question, nonverbally, to make her evaluate her life and helps her along by showing her a panoramic, instantaneous playback of the major events of her life. At some point she finds herself approaching some barrier or border, apparently representing the limit between earthly life and the next life. Yet, she finds that she must go back to the earth, that the time for her death has not yet come. At this point she resists, for by now she is taken up with her experiences in the afterlife and does not want to return. She is overwhelmed by intense feelings of joy, love, and peace. Despite her attitude, though, she somehow reunites with her physical body and lives. Later she tries to tell others, but she has trouble doing so. In the first place, she can find no human words adequate to describe these unearthly episodes. She also finds that others scoff, so she stops telling other people. Still, the experience affects her life profoundly, especially her views about death and its relationship to life. 1 Because God loves us there has to be an afterlife. God would not put us through this tough life with no purpose. That’s not his nature. Hamlet was wrong when he said, “Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” God is not an idiot. There is method to his madness. Earthly life, therefore, is filled with meaning since by God’s existence and nature there is an afterlife in which life is changed, not ended. Mother Teresa simply said the meaning of life is to be holy and go to heaven. What we do in these few years is going to determine our eternity. If only people planned for eternity as much as they plan for retirement. The afterlife will be our greatest fulfillment. Eternal life is the ultimate reality because all other things will pass away. Eternity is our destiny, what we were created for. “I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish” (Jn 10:28). __________________ 1.

Asking after all is not the same thing as denying.

I live in a small town, and the bank manager and assistant manager know me by name, as do most of the tellers. About the only reason I go into the bank (as opposed to at the drive through window) is cash withdrawals. It is not uncommon for me to do a bank transaction in cash or a big check or wire, sometimes of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Because we’re on a first name basis, and they know I’m just a businessman, it’s not at all uncommon for them to ask “oh, doing anything interesting with this?” and the answer is never going to be more interesting than buying or selling a used car, a house, or something like that. It doesn’t bother me. I can’t image a time when I’d care, but if for some reason I wanted to keep it secret, I’d probably just say I was thinking about buying a used car.

But it wasn’t always for the reasons you’d guess. One woman, who was pointed out to me as having mental illness when I started working, was consumed with the fear that she wouldn’t be on record as being the “right” religion when she died. She fixated on the “religious preferences” field in the computer, which she must have noticed during the admissions process at some point. The registration person would ask, “is there a religious preference you would like listed?” and you could see something just click in her head, as if she were switching into intense focus mode. She would stare with this sort of terrified fascination at the blinking orange cursor. “Baptist! Put Baptist!” She would watch the screen herself to confirm, then make registration go back to confirm it a few screens later, as if the computer or the registrar got sneaky and undid the change. Then she wanted to see proof of it on a printout. She was a frequent patient, and this happened several times a week. Sometimes more often. Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, Episcopalian, Methodist, you name it. Over time, the need to check her religious affiliation in the computer superseded any reason she gave for coming to the Emergency Department. She had started out by complaining of chest pains, arrhythmias, difficulty breathing. Her need for care got less urgent as she assured herself that the religion listed on her record was the current correct one. What ended up happening, after years of this, was that she would come in with an entirely fabricated complaint, go through her checking ritual, and sign out against medical advice or leave from triage. It was a considerable drain on resources to accommodate her. She never understood that she could accomplish the same thing by approaching a registration or admissions employee during a less busy time and asking them. She always thought she had to formally sign in as a patient to get to the religious-question point. While I would sigh internally when I saw her walk in, as someone who deals with OCD compulsions my heart went out to her.

Plugging these values into the formula: Sum = (10/2) * (1 + 10) = 5 * 11 = 55 Therefore, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 55."},{"instruction":"Why did George Washington choose to be George Washington, President of the United States and not George I, King of the United States?","output":"It’s important to remember one vital fact: George Washington really, honestly did not want the job. When Washington resigned his commission in 1783, it wasn’t merely because he thought the power he could wield was dangerous- nor was it just because he believed in the superiority of civil government over military dictatorship. Simply put, he was tired and wanted to go home. He’d spent eight years of one of the most exhausting and (at the time) thankless jobs imaginable, and while he was doing it his personal finances went to hell as his plantation was mismanaged deeply into debt. He wanted to go home and spend what he thought were a last few years before he died in peace. (Washington’s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had all died relatively young, and their example weighed on his mind.) Washington had had to be cajoled and enticed into even participating in the Constitutional Convention, never mind presiding over it. Likewise, it took a lot of persuading before he allowed himself to be considered as a candidate- as THE candidate, really- for the first president. Even then, he stated repeatedly to his advisors that he only intended to hold the office until he was sure the new national government had found its footing and would be able to sustain itself. When Washington finally left the presidency, by all accounts, he was glad to be shed of it. He enjoyed practically nothing of the eight year experience. He loathed the perpetual ceremony and public adulation, and he loathed even more the venom of the opposition press. Indeed, he had threatened to leave office at the end of his first term, and again in 1794, and had to be persuaded both times to stay on a bit longer. Now, even if you leave aside Washington’s dislike of monarchy as an institution, and even if you omit the fact that Washington had no children to carry on a royal line, you must consider: would this man, who wanted nothing more than a retired life of quiet and solitude, ever consent to be made a king? Not likely."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","output":"One tip that I have for PhD students is to not allow perfectionism to get the best of them. When writing your thesis, you want to make sure that it's as perfect as possible, but there is no such thing as a perfect thesis. No matter how hard you try to make it perfect, there will always be mistakes (grammatical, formatting, etc.) that you can't catch. Work on making it 99% perfect while also keeping in mind the other 1% and how they will affect the final product. Another tip would be to write summaries of your chapters before writing the actual chapter itself. For example, if your chapter is on how laser guns work, you might want to write a summary on what lasers are and what they do so you know enough information to create the chapter. This way your reader won't be lost when reading through thick blocks of text (or complicated sentences). A third tip would be to read more about writing a good thesis than actually writing one. You'll find so much information out there about what makes a great/poor paper - from general guidelines of structuring your paper, references/citations and grammar/formatting errors to specific points like avoiding passive sentences andMore information: [LINKED_TEXT: https:/sites.google.com/view/usps-download-shipping-label/] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/usps-download-shipping-label/]"},{"instruction":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","output":"As I write this, today’s the tenth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, CT — a tragedy that should have been prevented. In regards to the question that I’m about to answer, if I had the power to go back in time and alter world history — it’d be to prevent those from causing the various shooting sprees throughout most of history which remain not only reckless but also pointless. If only Adam Lanza got help in terms of mental health treatment long before the Sandy Hook incident — his murder victims would still be alive today, and their families and friends would be less traumatized (and not just by the shooting spree’s aftermath). Of course, changing the past’s impossible. What shouldn’t be impossible for us to do is learn from past mistakes in order to prevent them from ever happening again."},{"instruction":"What do teenagers wish adults understood?","output":"• We are not stupid. Our opinions are just as valid as yours. We may not have as much experience as you, but that doesn't mean we haven't had experiences that shape our beliefs. For example, I have a good friend that was abused as a child and found the courage to tell me and a few others. Is that not experience? I have walked down a road on a dark night and been catcalled, scared out of my mind. I have had surgery. You may have been the one who filled out the forms (yes, I am actually grateful by the way) but I am the one who went through it. Is that not experience? • Just because I am a teenager it doesn't mean I don't have any problems. I know what depression is. I know what anxiety is. In fact, I've been there myself at one point. I wish you would notice instead of telling me that I spend too much time in my room. Asking me why I talk to my friends so much and not as much to you would be a good question, apart from the fact that every time I do try and talk to you, you end up talking more than I do rather than listening. The reason I speak to my friends is because they LISTEN and offer me a solution rather than freaking out and telling me not to be depressed. • Please don't treat me as a child and expect me to act as an adult. I am almost an adult. I am much more reasonable and responsible than a child, and accordingly, I would not like to be treated like one. It's very frustrating when you say “you never respect us!”, because I never get any respect from you, no matter what I do or how responsible I am. A teenager does have their own (valid) opinions, as surprising as that may seem. “Because I said so” is one of the absolute worst things to hear as a teenager, because we want to hear the reason we are being punished and resolve the conflict like a grown person and talk it out. I don't like it when in a fit of anger, you demand to have my phone because I'm somehow “irresponsible”. • Put yourself in my shoes. You call me selfish and ask me to look at someone else’s perspective but my own, but have you even tried to do the same? I know I have. Go ahead, try it for a second. What do you think my day looks like? I can guarantee you, it's very different from how it was when you were a teen. Or maybe you can't envision a day in my life because all you talk to me about is homework and grades and constantly lecture me about how I need to study for my exams. Please know that I understand that, and am trying my best not to scream “STOP INTERRUPTING ME WHEN I'M TRYING TO STUDY!!” it's very, very frustrating when parents assume that everything is the same as when they were younger because it's not! No, I'm not up at 1am because I'm doing something inappropriate, I'm up because it's Monday night and I have three tests tomorrow, an essay, and AP exams next week! Shocker, right? I'm up because my idiot teacher decided to post the homework for tonight at 11pm on Google classroom, and set the due date for tomorrow. Can I do anything? Nope, except do the homework. Will you yell at me for staying up? Of course. But I know for a fact you'll lose it if that assignment shows up as a 0, so I just zone out from the yelling until you leave so I can finish in peace. • Not all teenagers are the same. Just because a group of kids were caught smoking weed in the bathroom, it doesn't mean I'm doing that. Just because someone else showed how irresponsible they are, it doesn't mean I am. I'm not getting myself pregnant, just because I have one B it doesn't mean I'm not graduating, and yes, I DO know what I'm doing. To finish this answer, I want to put a disclaimer out there that my parents are pretty great parents. They do a lot for me and I'm very appreciative of that whether I express it or not. But it can be extremely frustrating when you, in your moments of anger and frustration, are unreasonable with us. We are already struggling, trying to keep a handle on the million things that life throws at us. So please, be patient and try not to scream at me for every little thing I do. Instead, support me."},{"instruction":"What is the future tense of teach?","output":"Will teach"},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"I don't know my cat never did and the cats I know people have don't either they may go outside but they always come home.

In fact, many successful candidates have started their preparation in their mid to late twenties and have gone on to clear the exam. Age is just a number and should not be a deterrent for anyone who aspires to become a civil servant. The Civil Services Exam is not just about rote learning or memorization, but also about analytical and critical thinking, communication skills, and a deep understanding of the society and governance. Moreover, with the increasing life expectancy and the trend of people pursuing multiple careers, starting the preparation at 26 years of age is not a bad decision. It gives the candidate ample time to prepare, gain knowledge and experience, and develop their personality and leadership skills. However, it is important to keep in mind that the Civil Services Exam is a highly competitive and challenging exam. It requires consistent effort, dedication, and hard work. The preparation requires a long-term strategy and planning, with a focus on building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills. The candidate should also be aware of the eligibility criteria and the exam pattern, and plan their preparation accordingly. They should also keep themselves updated with the current affairs and the latest developments in various fields. The age at which a candidate starts preparing for the exam is not the only determining factor in their success. Several other factors, such as their academic background, work experience, and personal circumstances, also play a crucial role. In conclusion, age should not be a barrier to pursue one's dreams of becoming a civil servant. Starting the preparation at 26 years of age is a good decision, provided the candidate is dedicated, committed, and has a clear strategy and plan in place. With the right attitude, hard work, and perseverance, anyone can crack the Civil Services Exam and achieve their dream of becoming a civil servant."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"Here are some of the greatest ways to invest money so you may accumulate lasting riches.

For example is the charges from the doorknob that would be transferred to you if touch. What is really the key term to understand electrostatics over electrodynamics?","output":"Why is it called electrostatics if the charges are not that really at rest? Why is what called electrostatics? For example [sic] is the charges from the doorknob that would be transferred to you if touch [sic]. “_Is_ the charges”? (Emphasis mine.) What is really the key term to understand electrostatics over electrodynamics? A problem in electrostatics is usually to solve for the potential given a static distribution of charges or to calculate multiple moments of a localized (discrete or continuous) distribution of charges. [NEW CONTENT: Sorry, I overlooked this: Electrostatics also includes boundary-value problems, where the potential on all relevant surfaces in a problem is given, and one has to solve for what the potential is everywhere. END OF NEW CONTENT] Add in polarization of molecules. If there is a spark, that can be considered electrostatics in that the current is very brief. In the case of lightning, yes, there will be bigger effects. You can’t always draw a sharp line between categories. As an extreme example, look at how hard it was to define a planet. And there is still controversy over Pluto, but I think that’s now mainly among laypeople. (I think most professional astronomers/astrophysicists agree now that Pluto is a dwarf planet, or Kuiper object, but certainly not a full-fledge planet. It’s always been an oddball, with an inclination close to twice that of the range of the planets [17 deg., while the planets span range from 0 to 7 deg.]. It has a moon that is almost as big as itself. Parts of its orbit are closer to the sun than any of Neptune’s.) I don’t recall ever learning about what it takes for a sudden breakdown in the air to produce lightning in any electromagnetism course I’ve ever taken. What many consider to be the bible of electromagnetism is a book by J. D. Jackson titled Classical Electrodynamics. It includes four chapters dedicated to electrostatics. In these chapters, charges only move when you change the situation. They move and achieve equilibrium (a new static configuration of charges) So that means electrostatics is in some way part of electrodynamics. So lightning and regular sparks may not be strictly electrostatics. But it is very quick and results in a new static situation (or a new static configuration of charges, if you prefer)."},{"instruction":"am physically fit and have a proper diet, however, my BMI of 18 suggests I’m underweight how is this possible?","output":"It’s possible for the reason that [LINKED_TEXT: Timothy Sassanell ] [URL: https://www.quora.com/I-am-physically-fit-and-have-a-proper-diet-however-my-BMI-of-18-suggests-I-m-underweight-how-is-this-possible/answer/Timothy-Sassanella]gave.

All the papers consist of 150 questions. However, each paper has a different sectional pattern. That means if you get a good score in one section of the paper, you won't necessarily get a good score in the others. Therefore, you need to focus on just one section. Section 1: General Science There are 40 questions in Section 1, including topics such as chemistry, physics, biology, microbiology, anatomy, etc. There are 30 marks for each correct answer. Thus, if you get 15 points in this section, you'll receive 100% marks. So we recommend that you spend the maximum amount of time in this section. Section 2: Chemistry This section contains 25 questions. Each question gives 25 marks. This means that you need to earn 125 marks to pass the exam. The chemical concepts covered here are acids, bases, water, solubility, conductivity, oxidation-reduction reaction, etc. We suggest you spend the maximum amount possible of time on this topic. Section 3: Physics If you're confident about your knowledge of physics, then you don't need to worry about Section 3. There are 30 questions in total and all questions have equal importance. Each question gives 20 marks. Thus, if you earn 120 marks in this section, you will receive 100%. But if you earn only 110 marks, you'll get 99.9%, which isn't enough. Section 4: Biology In this section, there are 20 questions. Each question covers basic aspects of biology, such as genetics, cells, organelles, reproduction, nutrition, etc. Here, you will need to pay special attention.

Also, the trailer and songs looked promising. There we were in the theater, me and my friend, all excited and on time, waiting for the movie to start. Then this group of friends walked in, who were seated next to us. About 10 of them, all equally excited. Just when the movie started, this girl walked in, who was a part of the group and had to sit right next to me. She came and started chatting when the movie had already started. Ignored that one as a normal customary greeting and such. Little did we know that this girl was about to wreak an entire episode of her movie reaction talent on us. She sat comfortably in the seat(way too comfortable as it started to become uncomfortable for me), jumping every alternate second. Then began her sighs and gasps and whistles and hooting and booing. At EVERY SCENE. The worst of all was when a really intense sequence was in progress. One where the heat was building, hundreds of pair of eyes glued to the screen. *SPOILER, DON’T READ IF YOU HAVEN’T WATCHED GULLY BOY YET* I am talking about the scene when there is a huge argument between Murad and his father, where he pushes him off his mother. Very real. Amazingly directed. Superbly acted. *SPOILER OVER* SHE STARTED CLAPPING. It was an emotional scene. Nothing that required any kind of cheering. It ruined the scene for us. I was done. INTERMISSION And she jumped from her seat, stumping on our legs, unapologetic-ally and left the theater. We were praying for her to not return, as nobody was interested in her Reaction Video Part 2. It was so fake. So attention-seeking. We didn’t deserve it. Finally, we decided to politely tell her to dial it down for us to enjoy the movie as well. Interval over. Here she comes. Stumped on our foot, yet again. Was this on purpose? Shouldn’t be. Don’t know. Then we heard the voice of an angel. “Hey J****, let’s switch seats.” She agreed. That man was our hero. One true savior. We were spared from Part 2. Needless to say, the rest of the movie was great. We enjoyed it. We left with a smile. Just what we expected.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","output":"A 1:6 ratio? You might find that in a therapeutic or special-needs needs school - public or private - but mainstream private schools do not offer a 1:6 ratio. I’d agree with another answer that suggests families who place their children in private schools - sometimes at great expense - are certainly expecting a safe environment. But there are different kinds of private schools - and some of them offer even more than safety - they offer a school that is a community. Some private schools are better at that than others - but a school comprised of families who’ve chosen to be there - families who made the effort and go to the work and expense of placing their children in a school of choice - is empowering. If a private school - or a public school - moves forward with that - if it believes it is a community with a special purpose - students, teachers and parents can come together around that. A good private school administrator and an aware and enlightened faculty have the opportunity every day to heighten the sense of community - and offer the message - we’re all here because we chose to be. We are thinking people who make thoughtful choices. We make this community different - safer yes but also - thoughtful, reflective, healthy, active - athletic, artistic - diverse. You can find yourself here - you will be given choices every day and your teachers are your guides on the journey as you learn and grow. Not every private school is like that but many are - and as to the faculty - many private school teachers are graduates of private schools themselves. They understand and have been educated in a school that worked to be a community. Their own children attend the school they teach in - a well-run private school fosters a sense of shared endeavor between student, teachers and parents - And then in the pricey private schools there are many extras - it can be the difference between flying coach and flying business class - those extras are nice. Smaller class sizes - 1:15 - and a campus, grass, green playing fields. Those extras are nice but the heart of the matter is not the extras - it’s educating your children in a school of choice that is a thoughtful community - Your question had a snarky tone to it - was it a serious question? The affluent don’t have to brag about private schools - the affluent can afford private school. It’s not a question of whether or not they’ll send their children to private school - for the affluent it’s just a matter of which private school they’ll choose. Many private schools offer financial aid - it’s the parents who could never afford it but who’ve been helped to have their children there who tend to talk on about the school -"},{"instruction":"When do you cut back peonies, and do they bloom back?","output":"Herbaceous peonies are tender-stemmed plants that die back naturally in fall and regrow again in spring. Cutting back the dead stems to the ground in fall helps prevent insects and diseases and makes the garden look tidy. When you remove the stems, take care not to damage the crown, which is the fleshy part of the plant between the roots and the stems. Remove stems that are infested with diseases or insects as soon as you discover the problem. Trim tree peony branches to remove damage caused by winter weather and to correct structural problems in spring. The first thing you should know about pruning peonies is where to make the cut. The best place to cut a peony stem is just above a healthy bud. If the stem is diseased, make sure you cut back to healthy wood. Do not compost pruned cuttings that are diseased or infested with insects. Burn the stems or bag and discard them instead. In cases of severe injury or when the plant is overgrown, remove the entire stem by cutting it close to the ground. When two branches cross and rub against each other, remove the least desirable branch. The friction from constant rubbing creates a wound that serves as an entry point for insects and diseases. Disbudding is the removal of selected buds to control the size and quantity of the flowers. If you remove the side buds and leave the bud at the tip of a stem, you will get one very large blossom. Removing the terminal bud and leaving those along the sides of the stem results in more but smaller flowers."},{"instruction":"Why do some gun control opponents feel that the second amendment guarantees the right to own any type of gun whatsoever?","output":"Ok.

Coming to reservation which is the prime focus for choosing Delhi colleges… about that I have views that getting 20% in AIIMS is better ( as getting in 2nd best AIIMS after AIIMS Delhi and that after 5 years from now…so you can assume it's development in 2027–28 )as INICET can be given twice in a year( so in one year it becomes 40% and surely some students will get good ranks in first attempts, thereby lowering competition a bit in the second attempt of the institute) and NEET-PG only once and I want to get a Central institute in PG. One more thing is that in MAMC I will get reservation of 25%+10% (as out off 50% half will be caste reserved and i am from general category).

I think base R has a great minimalistic look, but this is very easy to adjust in ggplot2 anyway—the amount of control you have with the package is one of its main pros after all. I usually make my ggplots look like base R, basically. I’m biased, of course, since I do everything in ggplot2."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"Here's some things that have seemed to work well with my daughter. I'll put the “silly one” first. Hold an item in the store. I started this as soon as she was old enough to ask, a bit before 2 years old. She is always allowed to choose an item to hold while she's in the store. But she must put it back at the checkout. She gets to excitedly pore over the toys, stuffed animals and books and I get to avoid the screaming “I really really really want this!”Give choices. Always. She's in control of herself, not me. Many times the choice is between 2 things that I want her to do or even “choose to listen or choose to be disciplined”. (She did throw me a curveball with that when when it used to be choose ‘a’ discipline. She started saying, I choose to not listen and I choose time out. Lol) But for the most part it continues to work very well. It reminds her that she gets to be in control of her actions but there's a consequence to some choices.I always use the word discipline instead of punish. This is far more for me than her. It reminds me that it's never about “getting her back” for doing something that hurt or aggravated me. It's always about teaching her to become a fully functioning, well adjusted adult. It also helps me to remember some things don't need a consequence. Spilling her cereal all over herself and the floor is already upsetting. She doesn't need me to yell at her about being careless. That would not be offering her helpful guidance. That would just be letting out my frustration. So instead I let her know it's ok, it was just an accident. I know she wasn't being rambunctious or even careless. It was just an accident. Those are the moments it's most important for me to keep my cool and constantly using the word discipline reminds me of that.Everyone makes mistakes, even mommy and daddy. It's ok for her to make mistakes. We model how to deal with them by owning it when we do something wrong and apologizing and sometimes even explaining where we went wrong that led to the mistake. Then when she makes them we can help her do the same.Our daughter is actually a little bit of a perfectionist and would often not want to try for fear that she would mess up. Even after years of this “mistakes are ok” teaching. At a wonderful suggestion from a friend we began rewarding her the most for trying and not doing it perfectly. It's a load of crap that a kid can do anything if they just try. They aren't going to be great at everything. They can try and practice and practice at something and they still won't ever be great. THAT'S OK!!! There are other things they will be great at. Encourage them to try and fail. Dealing with failure is just as important as working hard and finally achieving success. I think this trick teaches them both things.I once read an article that dealt with the one phrase parents say with such anxiety. “How many times do I have to tell you this?!?” The article said that its as though there are two sides of the grand canyon. On one side is their desire to please us and the other is the desire to do what their urge wants them to. Every time you tell them what they should do it's like adding one plank in building a bridge between the 2 sides. So how many times do you have to tell them? Millions. Millions of times.Repeat key phrases of the things you really want to instill. One of the biggest ones for us is “who's always on your side? Mommy and Daddy.” When we are telling her no or disciplining or something we are doing it because we're on her side. When she's scared and we tell her we will protect her, she can trust that because we're on her side. When we're encouraging her to tell the truth, even if it will upset us she knows we will ALWAYS be on her side. When we're telling her that she was wrong and she needs to apologize she can still trust we are on her side. I'm hoping and praying that phrase sticks.It's good for your kids for you to put your marriage first. The best thing you can give your children is a healthy marriage. This is backed up by so much science and I get that for many people this is not in their control. I'm not judging. But for those of us with good partners, it's OK to tell the kids it's mommy and daddy time. Not just for the few minutes between their bedtime and yours. Not just at once a month date night. Every single day. When hubby calls on his lunch break, non urgent matters get put on hold. At night, before bedtime she has to play by herself for awhile. Yes, she gets playtime with daddy too, of course. But mommy and daddy want to talk and hang out together. Because we love each other. Kids don't always come first. My husband and I have been married for 16 years and we still just enjoy each other. We can do just fine without the other and sure, we get alone time too. But we love talking and being together. I want our kids to have that one day too. That will be so much easier if they've seen it in action. So if you have the ability to model a great relationship, don't feel guilty for doing what it takes to nurture it.Finally, don't look at your kids as extensions of yourself. Their successes are their own. Their failures are their own. It's your job to guide and nurture them. Not to do it for them. Our part as parents is monumentally important. But ultimately, none of us will ever really know how much we actually affected the outcomes. So stop taking offense when they screw up. Stop being “proud” of their achievements as though you did it just as much as they did. Be excited for them, or sad. Be impressed and enthralled with them. Be happy at every sign that shows you they are whole people, capable of succeeding on their own two feet. That's all I've got for now."},{"instruction":"What are the things you shouldn't share on social media?","output":"Anything that should remain private, can hurt the sentiments of others’, sends hate or portrays any sort of discrimination based on race, gender, ethnicity should never be posted online."},{"instruction":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","output":"Cryptocurrency can be a great investment with astronomically high returns overnight; however, there is also a considerable downside.

Having ideal weight is important if you want to overcome obesity and risk of diabetes. Secondly, take the right medication. And I won't bore you to say take insulin injections. They don't heal high blood sugar or diabetes. So come along with me as I strongly feel obliged to answer this, particularly since I experienced high blood sugar problem for 6 years. Fortunately I am today healed from this health disturbing situation that sucks. Diabetes affects many people globally with the United States making the world’s top 60 countries with diabetes challenges. Here's World Diabetes Population Data: Diabetes is a complex chronic ailment that affects both men and women, and it doesn't need any invitation before it strikes, since we are all living in a world where we can't escape certain types of food and lifestyle that cause it. These foods are known to contain sugars which build up in the long run to become excessive amounts of glucose in the blood stream. And failure to put things in moderation could lead to long-term health concerns if not properly attended to. Am 58 years old and have been ravaged by high blood sugar condition, resulting in my body's incapacity to adequately digest glucose. Well for 6 years I battled with high blood sugar, diabetes with its many symptoms despite many attempts to treat it. And then, Recently, I took a visit as I normally do, to my doctor in Atlanta GA, for a check up, and to my utmost surprise, I was diagnosed free and cleared from type 2 diabetes. I may say that's a lucky diagnosis, because I know how much I had tried keto diets, exercises, injections and even prescribed herbs, all to no avail. I must say it came at the right time, but I truly owe my type 2 diabetes healing to Medicals Research Foundation Australia - on finding the solution to High Blood Sugar control. The best solution before the team at MRF came into the scene, would be to treat with insulin shots, which apparently still doesn't cure it till date. I survived on that for years anyways! Scientists and doctors at MRF didn’t have to do much. All they did to find a treatment for high blood sugar or Type 2 Diabetes was to administer some of the new medications that are already available. So for a space of their research timeframe, they had been failing, until they broke through with Glucotrust medication. According to Medicals Research website, glucotrust was administered on research basis with several volunteers who were suffering from high blood sugar or type 2 diabetes. The research saw several people in the case study - completely healed from High Blood Sugar, diabetes. This led to so many people in Australia trying out glucotrust, and the results have been phenomenal with positive reviews. If you do your own research, you will find these claims to be true with floods of people giving glucotrust reviews to attest its efficacy. Glucotrust is the new kid on the block for efficient treatment of diabetes or high blood sugar, and it has actually gone viral in the United States, Canada, Australia, U.K and other parts of the world. What makes Glucotrust effective? According to Medicals Research Foundation, it has to do with the special herb ingredients found in the tablets. These glucotrust ingredients include: Biotin which is scientifically known for improving the production of insulin. Others include Gymnema Sylvestre an organic herb extract used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, and is known for controlling sugar cravings, weight loss, and healthy blood sugar level. Chromium, Licorice Root, Manganese, Cinnamon, Juniper Berries, Zinc, among others. All of these were tested at MRF and found to be the factors responsible for helping boost diabetic patients immune system, and totally minimizing the risks associated with type 2 diabetes. So where insulin pumps and other devices or medications have failed, glucotrust is helping people globally win the diabetes war. With people globally talking about glucotrust, all over the internet, it certainly is going to dominate the diabetes space in the future years. With the breakthrough, also comes its challenges. Since Glucotrust is becoming very popular, it has also become one Of The Many Counterfeited Drugs out there. My good friend living about 40 miles away from me - unfortunately got the counterfeit initially, but then later got the original. He got to know, since the fake ones, according to him was messing up his system, causing headaches, while also increasing his blood level the more. We all know that some of the world's best medications have their own battles with counterfeiting in this context as well, so this should be expected. Counterfeit Glucotrust is of serious concern because it is impossible to know exactly what it contains and what side effects it could cause, especially for someone who has never used it before. The trouble is, counterfeit GlucoTrust can look EXACTLY like legitimate GlucoTrust, with a few minor differences. Some of these differences as I list them below: Color consistency: Real GlucoTrust is uniform in color. Counterfeit GlucoTrust may have variations of color within the same tablet, or between different tablets in the same packet. The color on one side of a counterfeit tablet may look different from the color on the other side. Tablet shape: An original GlucoTrust tablet has a distinct shape with smooth edges. Counterfeit GlucoTrust tablets are quite jagged with an indent before the edges. Number of tablets per pack: Real GlucoTrust is available in single packs of 30 tablets. If a packet contains more or less than these, it is likely counterfeit. Is Glucotrust the remedy for high blood sugar and is it what the world has been waiting for, for centuries? GlucoTrust works perfectly for high blood sugar levels or type 2 diabetes, as I have used it for about 5 months now and it completely normalized my blood level. On final note, Please it’s better to not go for it at all if you are not sure of its source. Only get Glucotrust through a reputable source and don’t be overwhelmed by the many glucotrust reviews out there. The first step to getting it right would be to find out more about [LINKED_TEXT: Glucotrust and its case studies at Medicalsresearch Foundation here.] [URL: https://glucotrust.medicalsresearch.com/] I sincerely pray this helps every high blood sugar or diabetic patient who have taking time to read up to this point.

So what is happening is that the radiation is stimulating the nerves in the tongue which sends a message back to the brain that there is a taste in the mouth. The brain interprets the signals as being metallic even though there may be nothing at all in the mouth. So the strange tastes noted are from the stimulation of nerves by ionizing radiation."},{"instruction":"w much will liposuction cost in India?","output":"More than the cost one should be concerned over the credibility and authenticity of the surgeon and centre.

The noise: The sudden, loud noises of firecrackers can be very startling and frightening for dogs. They may not be able to identify the source of the noise or understand what is happening. This can lead to fear and anxiety.The unpredictability: The unpredictable nature of firecrackers can also be frightening for dogs. They may not know when the next firecracker will go off, which can make them feel even more anxious.The smell: The smell of gunpowder can also be upsetting for dogs. They may associate the smell with pain or danger, which can lead to fear.Past experiences: If a dog has had a negative experience with firecrackers in the past, they are more likely to be afraid of them in the future. For example, if a dog was injured by a firecracker, they may associate the sound of firecrackers with pain and become afraid of them. If your dog is afraid of Diwali firecrackers, there are a few things you can do to help them cope. Stay calm: It is important to stay calm if your dog is afraid of firecrackers. If you become anxious or stressed, your dog will pick up on your emotions and become even more afraid.Create a safe space: You can create a safe space for your dog in a quiet room with limited access to windows. This will give them a place to go where they feel safe and secure.Play calming music: Playing calming music can help to soothe your dog and reduce their anxiety.Give your dog treats: Giving your dog treats when they hear firecrackers can help to associate the sound with something positive.Desensitize your dog: Desensitization is a process of gradually exposing your dog to the things they are afraid of in a controlled environment. This can help your dog to learn to associate the firecrackers with something positive, such as treats or praise. If you are concerned about your dog's fear of firecrackers, you may want to consult with a veterinarian or animal behaviorist. They can help you develop a treatment plan that is right for your dog. Here are some additional tips that may help: Avoid taking your dog to areas where firecrackers are being set off.If you must take your dog to an area where firecrackers are being set off, keep them on a leash and close to you.Cover your dog's ears with soft earmuffs or a towel.Talk to your veterinarian about medication that can help to reduce your dog's anxiety.

Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","output":"Rent seeking is not what many people think it is. It’s a term from economics. Economists at least do not think earning a profit from owning a business is bad, and assume that firms are profit seeking enterprises. In the broadest sense, rent seeking is any sort of behavior that seeks to claim something of value without creating any value. It’s everything from unions trying to drive up wages without creating any extra value for the employer, to a large corporation lobbying for laws that benefit them and harm their competitors. The “rent” in the term is economic rent. It’s not the usual thing that people think of. Economic rent is the same thing as economic profit, which is profit in excess of what the given amount of resources invested can typically own. Economic profits aren’t bad, but they are generally temporary if things are functioning efficiently. Another way to view rent seeking is attempts to restrict competition so as to enjoy economic profits over a longer period of time than would happen under free competition. Rent seeking is a useful concept, but the problem is that it’s hard to generate agreement as to when it exists. In theory, the test is who policy X benefits: just the obvious people accused of rent seeking, or other groups, like consumers? This is clear in theory but can be hard to know in practice."},{"instruction":"Can I use a commercial restaurant degreaser to defog my headlamps?","output":"The apparent ‘fogging’ of plastic headlight lenses can not be improved with any cleaner.

Best defense is a good offense, eh? The Joint Russian-Republican Propaganda Taskforce does not want to discuss whether today’s GOP has acquired key traits of fascism, which is “a form of radical authoritarian ultranationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy.” Obviously, the GOP isn’t all the way there—not yet at least. But the “authoritarian ultranationalism” is a leitmotif of Trump’s rule—the way his “America First” policy has been expressed in his unilateralism, insulting allies while kissing up to fellow autocrats, and abrogating international agreements such as the Iran nuclear accord, TPP, and the Paris Accord. And the “suppression of opposition” has become ever more obvious in the GOP’s nationwide, systematic voter suppression program, a recent example being the disenfranchisement of Indians living on reservations in North Dakota—which was endorsed by the SCOTUS right-wing majority. You can see the stirrings of regimentation of society in Trumpublicans’ outrage at any and all criticisms of Trump—even when it’s a matter of record, such as his being a convicted swindler. Even when they controlled every branch of the federal government, Trump voters were fed a daily diet of aggrievance, as if they were an oppressed minority rather than the party of America’s rulers. This is how you move society towards regimentation—by treating dissent as treason, by revanchism (Make America Great Again), by imposition of the local version of Sharia Law (as with leaving abortion nominally legal but in practice nearly impossible to obtain). The GOP’s anti-science/anti-intellectualism also aids regimentation of society. Agreement with the Big Man is the only thing that’s acceptable. The litmus test for Republican candidates today is “do you stand with the President?” rather than whether they support traditional Republican principles. Capture of government by business is also part of this. Have a beef with a corporation? The contract you’d signed requires arbitration of disputes by arbitrators whose livelihood depends on them finding for the corporation in every instance. But rather than discuss the radical disconnect between the GOP of Eisenhower or even GHW Bush, the Joint Russian-Republican Propaganda Taskforce wants the discussion to be about the Democratic Party’s supposed embrace of Soviet-style socialism—a word not one Republican voter out of 100 can define accurately, but which has become a Magic Word, imbued with the mana of “foreign enslavement” by the propagandameisters of the GOP and now uttered in a kind of priestly chanting tone by Trump as he invokes the Magic Word time after time. My suggestion: in your discussions with people of the Republican religion, when they start in on the Democrats’ so-shul-ism, don’t deny it—ask them what they mean. You’ll find they want to speak in broad generalities. Force them to talk specifics. Ask them whether they’d like to privatize the police, for example. So when you dial “911” the first thing the operator asks is your insurance company and number that entitles you to “911” privileges—and which police force your insurance entitles you to use. How about five different sewer pipes to your house, with you choosing which to use on the “free market.” Schools? Highways? City streets? The electrical grid? And is all government regulation socialism? Is it communistic to have meat inspected to make sure the steak you buy doesn’t have maggots? How about airliner inspection and regulation? How about smog inspection? (too bad Republicans don’t travel abroad, or they’d have experienced the choking smog in third world cities) Is single-payer socialism? If so, what’s the difference between that and a government-run healthcare system? If we can’t afford single payer, why is it every other rich nation can, and not one of them want our system? Stick to specifics, because the devil is in the details. The more effective way to enslave people is to get them to enslave themselves. Once they get woke it gets far more expensive to do so."},{"instruction":"What is the best defence against ransomware?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: McAfee Mobile Security Antivirus ] [URL: https://ekaro.in/enkr20230304s22020519]is a mobile security app developed by McAfee LLC, a cybersecurity company.

I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","output":"Choosing a Dance Style You can choose from many styles of dance such as Ballet, jazz, modern, hip-hop. Nothing says you have to stick with one, either. Maybe you like the expression of modern dance but also enjoy the fun partner work found in swing dancing. You'll quickly discover that learning any style of dance will help you learn another, so feel free to explore. Many dancers choose to start with ballet. It's a very formal style and good for training your body to move with a certain elegance and flow. The foot and hand positions of ballet also carry over into other styles, so it's really not a bad idea to take a few ballet classes and learn the fundamentals of dancing. Finding a Great Dance Class Dance schools are readily available in many cities and towns, so there's likely to be one or two near you. Some are privately owned while others are run by community centers, universities, or local organizations. Check around your area and see what is available. Ask friends about their experience with a school and check to see if you can observe a class or two to get a feel for it. Whether you're looking to take a tango class at night or enroll your daughter in ballet, it's a good idea to find out a little about the instructor. Like all professions, there are good dance teachers and those who are not as great. Dancers should feel comfortable with their instructors.

That’s what evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers found with 30 years of research, “Our sensory systems are organized to give us a detailed and accurate view of reality, but once this information arrives in our brains, it is often distorted and biased to our conscious minds.” We repress painful memories, create false ones, rationalize immoral behavior and jack up our self-esteem. We deny ourselves the truth. Triver’s theory is: We often deceive ourselves because it then becomes easier to deceive others. One way we lie to ourselves, he learned, is by seeking information selectively. [LINKED_TEXT: Lying to Yourself Helps You Lie to Others] [URL: http://discovermagazine.com/2013/june/01-lying-to-yourself-helps-you-lie-to-others] The mechanism of how this happens is partly explained by Gestalt principles in relation to how we collect sensory input that demonstrates that things are literally not what we see!

[LINKED_TEXT: The more you lie, the easier it gets] [URL: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20085-the-more-you-lie-the-easier-it-gets/] Neuroimaging studies have shown that people’s brains show considerably more activity when they are lying than when they are not, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting that lying requires extra cognitive control and inhibition of truth-telling. Lying also takes measurably longer than telling the truth. Essentially almost all research points to the direction that lying started off with being an evolutionary advantage to humans, but got rooted out with the progress of civilization that wrote laws to override natural instincts that are counterproductive to peaceful, harmonious community living. Deception as a survival mechanism is not unique to humans. Think possum (pretending to be dead), chameleon (camouflaging by switching colour) etc. Tl;dr, the question of what do we lie about to ourselves is rather difficult to answer in specifics. It's practically anything and everything that gives us an advantage over others. Lying starts within ourselves to be most effective.

These are; electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. The first two are familiar. Electromagnetism is the force that holds a fridge magnet to a refrigerator while gravity is trying to pull it off towards the earth. The strong nuclear force is responsible for holding the central part of atoms (their nuclei) together, while the weak nuclear force is involved in the decay of these nuclei. In the attempt to tie all the four forces together a lot of interesting ideas and new theories have been proposed. One of the most promising of these new theories is string theory. In attempting to unite gravity with the three other forces, string theory requires us to change the way we view the universe. According to the theory all particles are actually tiny vibrating strings and each type of vibration corresponds to a different particle. The different particles are like the different notes that can be played by bowing a violin string. However, the strings of string theory almost certainly would not look like violin strings. String theory also requires us to accept the existence of extra dimensions in the universe. We are familiar with the four usual dimensions: up-down, forwards-backwards, left-right and time, but string theory requires seven more dimensions!A universe of eleven dimensions seems strange to us but many physicists think these extra dimensions are possible and are looking for ways to detect them. The attempt to unify the 4 forces of nature is one of the most exciting areas of physics and I hope to be around if this is successful, whether it is string theory or some other candidate that is successful. On the other hand there is the possibility that no single, theory exists that can describe all the forces of nature in a neat and tidy way as we would like. Whatever the outcome, scientists from all over the world will continue working together to discover what could be the ultimate theory of everything. watch these awesome videos you will easily understand string theory and I am definite that you will get a clear idea and interest on string theory."},{"instruction":"US is threatening to downgrade ties with India over its planned purchase of S400 missiles from Russia.

Now If we talk about US threats, it is basically because US doesn't wants India to have a sophisticated air defense system like this because no major power wants a third world country to become assertive and lose it's prominence. US is already losing it's power as a hegemon which it had after the end of cold War and the space has been taken by China. US already faces new challenges everyday from China. China is getting assertive in South China Sea where it has reclaimed islands and is hampering freedom of navigation. In Africa It is investing heavily, using resources and mating African countries dependent on China. The investment is so large that that it can't be completed by other countries. China doesn't even follows Orders of ICJ. Now if you understand all this, the point which comes out is that US needs a strong Ally to counter China especially in Asia and only India can counter it. This despite warning India has been engaging diplomatically with US for exemption. US knows that it needs India and that's why till now it hasn't put sanctions on India. India has made it clear that a strong India is beneficial to US. Then comes the National Security of India, with two hostile nuclear powered neighbors we can't ignore our security and that's why India will be going for S400. To make it clear that India is not overly leaned towards Russia India have gone for large purchase of US Defense Equipments Like Apache, Chinook, M-777 Howitzer. It signed LEMOA and COMCASA with US to boost defense cooperation.

The chemical composition of coacervates depends on the type of polymer used, but they typically contain a core of one type of polymer surrounded by a shell of another type of polymer.Microspheres: Microspheres are small spherical particles that are commonly made from synthetic polymers, such as polystyrene, polyethylene, or polyvinyl alcohol. The chemical composition of microspheres is determined by the type of polymer used, and they can be further modified with surface coatings, such as proteins or lipids, to improve their stability and biocompatibility.Liposomes: Liposomes are spherical particles that are composed of a lipid bilayer membrane that encapsulates an aqueous compartment. The lipid bilayer is made up of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic molecules that have a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head. The chemical composition of liposomes is determined by the type of phospholipids used, and they can be further modified with additional lipids, such as cholesterol, or with functional molecules, such as drugs, to improve their properties and functionality. In summary, the chemical composition of coacervates, microspheres, and liposomes is determined by the type of polymer, lipid, or other functional molecules used to make the particles.

What are the types of buffer solutions?","output":"Buffer solutions are water-based solvent consisting of a mixture of a weak acid as well as the conjugate base of the weak acid, or a weak base including the conjugate acid of the weak base. Buffer solutions resist a change in pH when diluted or when there is an addition of small amounts of acid/alkali to them. What is Buffer Solution? The buffer solution is a solution which is able to maintain its Hydrogen ion concentration (pH) with very minute changes when diluted or added a small amount of either acid or base. Some [LINKED_TEXT: uses of buffer solutions] [URL: https://www.doubtnut.com/question-answer-chemistry/definition-and-types-9864974] are in fermentation, food preservatives, drug delivery, electroplating, printing, the activity of enzymes, blood oxygen carrying capacity need specific hydrogen ion concentration (pH). Solutions of a weak base and its conjugate base or weak base and its conjugate acid are able to maintain pH and are therefore buffer solutions. Types of Buffer Solution Buffer solutions can be classified into acidic and alkaline buffers. Acidic Buffers Acidic solutions are used to maintain acidic environments. Acidic buffers have acidic pH and is made by mixing a weak acid and its salt with a strong base. An aqueous solution consisting of an equal concentration of acetic acid and sodium acetate has a pH of 4.74. The pH of these solutions is below sevenThese solutions have a weak acid and a salt of a weak acid.An example is a mixture of sodium acetate and acetic acid (pH=4.75). Alkaline Buffers Alkaline buffer solutions are used to maintain basic conditions and has a basic pH. It is prepared by mixing a weak base and its salt with strong acid. The aqueous solution which has an equal concentration of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride has a pH of 9.25. The Ph of the alkaline buffers is above seven.It contains a weak base and a salt of the weak base.An example is a mixture of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride (Ph=9.25). On addition of acid and base When acid is added, the released protons of acid are removed by the acetate ions to form an acetic acid molecule.When base is added, the hydroxide released by the base are removed by the hydrogen ions to form water Preparation of Buffer Solution If one knows the dissociation constant of the acid and of the base, then a buffer solution can be prepared by controlling the salt-acid or the salt-base ratio. These solutions are prepared by mixing the weak bases with their corresponding conjugate acids, or by mixing weak acids with their corresponding conjugate bases. Significance of Henderson Equation Henderson Equation is used for the following: To calculate the pH of the buffer prepared from a mixture of the salt and weak acid/base.To calculate the pKa value.To prepare buffer solution of needed pH. Limitations of Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation The limitation of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is that it cannot be used for strong acids and strong bases. Buffering capacity The buffer capacity of a buffer is the number of millimoles of acid or base to be added to a litre of buffer solution in order the change the pH by one unit. pH Maintenance how buffer solutions maintain a constant pH can best be understood by the example of a buffer solution containing sodium acetate and acetic acid. In this example, the sodium acetate completely undergoes ionization whereas the acetic acid is only weakly ionized. When strong alkaline substances are added to this buffer solution, the hydroxide ions react with the acids which are free in the solution and gives water molecules. Uses of Buffer solutions Buffer solutions are used to maintain an optimum pH for enzyme activity in many organisms.Bicarbonate and carbonic acid buffer system are used in order to regulate the pH of animal blood.When these buffers are not present, then it may lead to the slowing of the enzyme action, loss in enzyme properties, or even denature of the enzymes. Denaturation can completely deactivate the catalytic action of the enzymes.

One such example is when Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, invested 5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis. At the time, many investors were fleeing the financial sector, and Goldman Sachs was facing significant challenges. Buffett recognized that Goldman Sachs was a well-run company that would likely survive the crisis and emerge stronger. He negotiated favorable terms for the investment, including a 10% dividend and the option to buy 5 billion worth of Goldman Sachs stock at a discounted price. The investment not only provided Goldman Sachs with much-needed capital, but it also generated significant returns for Berkshire Hathaway. The investment turned out to be a shrewd move, as Goldman Sachs' stock price rebounded, and Berkshire Hathaway ultimately realized a profit of more than 3 billion. Another example of a shrewd business maneuver is the way that Apple has successfully transitioned from a computer company to a consumer electronics company. In the early 2000s, Apple was struggling and was losing market share in the computer industry. However, under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple recognized the potential of the emerging market for consumer electronics and began developing innovative products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Apple's focus on design, usability, and innovation helped it to create a loyal customer base and establish itself as a leader in the consumer electronics market. Overall, these examples demonstrate the importance of shrewd and smart business maneuvers in achieving success in the business world.

Sometimes you can negotiate a lower rent but it is uncommon for the rent to be decreased because the majority of the rental markets have very little vacancy so landlords often opt to either not increase or increase in small amounts to good tenants. In larger metropolitan areas the rent will generally be much higher and increases are expected year to year. A rental decrease is rare but it happens."},{"instruction":"w many countries have you travelled to and which are they?","output":"I’ve never counted, but let’s see: USCanadaMexicoUKAustriaFranceGermanyNetherlandsItalyCzech RepublicSlovakiaPolandRussiaUkraineBelarusLatviaLithuaniaEstoniaFinlandSwedenTurkeyMongoliaChinaThailandAzerbaijan (while still part of USSR)Kazakhstan (while still part of USSR)"},{"instruction":"Why do people vape?","output":"Vaping THC helps me a lot (THC is a substitute for Weed in cigarettes/joints etc) I only vape THC when its midnight because THC makes me feel really tired and then i fall asleep and i get good sleep too for a good amount of time sometimes i dont sometimes i do depending how i feel but i also have to be careful, By careful i mean my depression can get the best of me i can go “Whatever fuck it” and i can smoke THC excessively and I dont know if anything bad can happen and i have to be very careful to avoid feeling like i dont give a shit, Although THC is my sleeping drug I do vape e-liquids too thats like casually now and then, I dont do it for being “cool” i have no friends that i can brag to about how cool i look doing it, Its just me in my room trynna chill"},{"instruction":"Was the space shuttle program good, or should NASA have chosen something else?","output":"no it basically draged 100 tons of dead wieght into orbit every time you wanted a capsule or a 20 ton payload it was also te only manned rocket iwthout an escape system and the only manned rocket that HAS to be manned to function every other manned rocket is baically an unmanned rocket with a capsle payload and an escape sytem so you cna TEST the rocket before putting humans in it an you cna launch satelltie without putting astronatus on the line neither was ever an option for the space shuttle"},{"instruction":"Why is there no cashew butter when there is peanut butter?","output":"Cashew butter: “Am I a joke to you?”"},{"instruction":"w do I start a successful YouTube channel and become a YouTuber?","output":"To start a channel on YouTube: 1.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"Edit, having seen your additional comment to detail your question, I hope she was rehomed to a truly respectful family, instead of staying with the narcissistic pseudo’family’ you unfortunately were stuck with. Your case now looks a typical narcissistic pseudo’family’ animal abuse case, where the only kind person, usually the scapegoated child, refuses to harm the animal. You seem a kind, decent, respectful person for refusing to murder her even when the narcissists try to coerce you. If you are, leave them, care for animals when animals in your care are not able to be harmed by narcissists. Go no contact. Don’t ever go back again. Make sure those disgusting narcissists are not let even near the animals you care for, they will try to harm animals, especially animals you care for, because of disgusting reasons. Plus, cats throw up then peeing everywhere may be a sign that they were harmed repeatedly. That cat should have not be there stuck with narcissists. I don’t blame you for choosing her though, because you probably did not know how disgustingly lack of empathy those narcissists could be. You probably regretted, how most people who did not know, then saw the real disgusting face of the disgusting narcissists, with either how they behave to people, to you, or to animals. You’ll find others who at least refuse to kill healthy animals. Leave, find your own people, find your real community, find your real family where they are people who respect you, plus respect the animals you care for. Previous, Don’t listen to those that accuse you because you don’t choose euthanasia. Especially if you don’t because you don’t hope to kill animals or people against their own will. Unless you’re keeping her for selfish reasons that does not concern her choice or consent to live or die, her choice or consent regarding her own life. There are disgusting narcissists that accuse others to avoid guilt, shame, blame they should have themselves. About euthanasia, Ethicality of euthanasia, it is dependent. Because of consent. Think about a person you love dearly, or actually, think about yourself. What would be your choice of euthanasia when you consider yourself? Euthanasia is not ethical, not moral, not compassionate, if it is without the person or animal’s willing, informed, voluntary, uncoerced consent. It is the most far from these. It is murder. Unless, It is voluntarily, willing chosen by the person or animal after having the informed knowledge that they are able to choose to die by euthanasia or choose to continue living. Along with the information of how the death will happen with euthanasia, how the life will go on without, are there cures that might not have been known about, is life really going to be worse or is there a chance of life not being worse. Then it would be true compassion. It then would be truly ethical, moral, comapssionate, Because it is the person or animal exercising their right to die by their own choice, plus others respecting their choice, respecting their right. Euthanasia without consent for animals or humans. Euthanasia without consent is falsely thought to be ‘compassionate’ by speciesists, because they know it will not happen to them. I said think about yourself, your own choice for yourself, rather than others, Because most people if they are too narcissistic they don’t even have the capability to know that it is not love if there is no respect. If a person or animal is terminally ill, it doesn’t mean they immediately hope to die. Sometimes even if a person is terminally ill, they still prefer to spend time with people or animals they love, rather than dying immediately by their own choice, let alone being killed without their consent just because their agony is too much for speciesists or narcissists that claim to ‘love’ them to watch. Will you choose to be put down or killed without your willing expressed consent? Unless you actually don’t hope to live yourself while having problems of getting others to understand you? Will you be ok continuing to live if you already know the best choice is to leave this world, even if no other human is capable of understanding you? Both answers is obviously no. Unless you are unable to even imagine those situations for yourself, or have the empathy to actually stand in the shoes of people who will go through these situations. Or if you are brainwashed or guilttripped enough by narcissists to wrongly think you have ‘duty’ to keep people ‘happy’ by staying alive while you don’t hope to, or even dying while you don’t hope to, to keep people ‘not miserable’ to watch your suffering whatever illness that you would rather suffer than die. That would not be consent, neither would it be a healthy choice that respects yourself. Euthanasia with consent for humans or animals. Euthanasia with consent for humans or animals is the true compassion because people plus animals, sentient beings, have the right to die if they willingly, voluntarily choose to. Regardless of ‘mental health’, or having or not having terminal illness that actually currently has no cure. People, animals, sentient beings, don’t have the obligation to live. Btw even cancer has been reversed by plant based doctors. A human terminally ill because of cancer should at least try that if they hope to live. This is not immediately relevant, just said because it is a duty plus responsibility to possibly save lives that should be saved, that hope to live, to share this information. What are the choices of true compassionate humans when it is humans or animals who have terminal illness that are extremely agonising? They find methods to understand if the person or animal still hope to live or not, for example, if a human is now without language to talk, or if their capability of understand is dubious, truely compassionate people would still make massive amounts of efforts to at least let them know there is a choice, find other options of cure, understand their choice or would be choice based on what their expressed preference is, Rather than take away their chance of to express themselves, or not put effort into understanding their choice then arbitrarily, condescendingly, disrespectfully ‘decide for them’ to kill them, without their consent, or along with against their will. This applies to animals because it would be speciesist not to. Animals have preferences, if we listen or watch. They make choices when they see the choices in front of them. If you ever watched a dog choose you will know this. The animal is not necessarily hoping to die or rather die than live, unless they already show no signs of willingness to participate in life, including being around people, other animals, participating in other things in life. They have willingness for no item, activity or individuals in life now. Then it would make sense to think the animal now unfortunately has no willingness to live. Then euthanasia would be the most probably compassionate choice because it would most probably be the animal’s own choice. A non narcissistic, truely compassionate person may at a less educated stage of their lives wrongly believe euthanasia without consent is ok. Many of us who now know euthanasia without consent is wrong, have been there before. Because we are not narcissistic, we are capable of admitting our own wrongs, grow, change our minds to prevent more unjust or negligent harm done, even if we have made wrong, unethical choices based on our previous opinions before. Hwoever, they will never claim it is ‘compassionate’ let alone accuse others of being ‘not compassionate’ to try to ‘justify’ their wrong, actually not compassionate, self serving decisions. What does it tell us about most people’s opinions about euthanasia to humans vs to animals? Most people don’t know or don’t respect consent. Most people have narcissistic thinking that focus on themselves rather than the people or animals who may or may not have euthanasia. We’re able to see this because every of their argument based on themselves or their ‘perceptions’. Rather than the actual reality or choice of the individuals actually concerned here. If they choose to unjustly murder these people or animals without their consent, it is because They think it is too much for them to watch the agony. They ‘think’, not observed, watched or actually listened to, the choice or preference of the human or animal about whether they choose to die by euthanasia or continue living. They don’t make efforts to understand the choice of the human or animal, or provide opportunity for them to know there are choices to choose from. They don’t make efforts to seek more possible medical help. They don’t make efforts to even admit they have financial problems if they have, nor to be honest then seek financial help. These are what people who truly hope to help animals or people would make efforts to accomplish, before making life or death decisions. Rather than just trying to help themselves, whether it is their own public image, emotional management, or whatever other needs that would be narcissistic, irrational, if they choose to harm non guilty others can let alone non guilty terminally ill animals or people, for it. Narcissists talk about their own emotional suffer instead of the animal or humans. They act to be ‘victims’ while the actual victim is the animals or humans. A typical vulnerable narcissist behaviour. They think it is ‘compassionate’, either based on peer pressure, or narcissistic self ‘justification’, to flee from natural guilt that is from have done wrong, unjust harm, or for ‘positive’ self image, to gain public ‘approval’ for agreeing with the public, in a narcissistic society that forms brainwashing by having basically no human arguing against euthanasia for animals without respect or consent. They falsely accuse others of what they are guilty of themselves, Their false accusations of others is confusing to others, because others don’t think narcissistically about themselves, let alone try to victimise themselves in situations where it is actually about the animals or people, instead of them. Their false accusations of others is based on how they narcissistically think, They think others think how they think, Then they accuse others based on false claims that narcissists would care about because of public image, examples are, ‘compassion’, ‘ethicality’, ‘morality’. While for non narcissists, they would care about these based on who is unjustly harmed, who is suffering. They care about the individuals rather than just themselves, especially in situations that are actually about the individuals, not them. Non narcissists talk about choice, consent, because they respect. Narcissists even accuse others of ‘keeping the animals while the animal suffer’, while this may be true when applied to the narcissists, Others, or at least non narcissistic others are confused when they see that false accusation because they don’t even think that. Because non narcissistic people don’t think animals or people are property, they don’t think people or animals are there to be ‘kept’ for their emotional needs. They don’t even have that false, narcissistic, self serving ‘logic’. They take responsibility of their own emotions, plus their own emotional needs, they know if others have done no wrong, then their emotions are entirely their own responsibility, probably plus certain responsibilities of negative things that happen in their own past, however none of those are the animal or people’s responsibilities who have done no wrong. hence they don’t blame others for ending the others’ own lives, nor they try to impose their own will to others to make others live for their emotional needs or to make other die unjustly for their emotional needs, when others have done no wrong. Non narcissistic choices or opinions are based on the reality, choices, preference of the animals or people, not themselves, when it is situations about the animals or people, not themselves. Because they have true empathy, true compassion, true ethicality, that focus on the animal’s or people’s reality, instead of their may be false perceptions or ideas of the reality, in situations where what actually matters is the animals’ or people’s reality. They know their perceptions may be wrong. They don’t hope to harm others because of their wrong perceptions, or lack of true perceptions that listens to, observes, the true preferences or choices of others based on others’ behaviour or expression. None of the narcissists’ choices or thinking is actually for the animal or for the human person. Or their choices will each be contaminated with their own irrational emotions, irrational because they don’t have the capability or willingness to be responsible for their emotions or to manage their emotions to avoid unjustly harming others, instead, they unjustly harm others for their irrational emotional gains. Hence, euthanasia without actual consent, I.e. willing, voluntary, informed, chosen consent, from the individuals themselves, human or animal, is the most far from true ethicality, true morality, true compassion. It would be narcissistic. Euthanasia because of respect for the individual’s actual consent, I.e. willing, voluntary, informed, chosen consent, from the individuals themselves, human or animal, Is true ethicality, true morality, true compassion."},{"instruction":"w do ballroom dance competitions work?","output":"Yes, but most of those women are not looking for romantic partners.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"From my experience with such a people, I’d say there are surely disadvantages. First of all, its hard to fool you with common believes, that you can easily see through as limited, questionable, and impossible to back up with anything solid. Regular people are raised in certain way, and they often stick to that, which eventually makes their life easier. It’s relatively easy to convince children (if their parents care enough) that its just a good thing to behave, to work hard, create a family, believe in God, love your country. I think many intelligent people at some point begin to see there are many alternative paths (a lot of people has it in adolescence, I know; its just that, for some, it never stops). That makes their life choices harder, if compared to people who just stop thinking about serious stuff at certain age, and start to follow the patterns, do what others do, work with here and now. Instead, people with IQ constantly question the choices they’ve already made, which is not helping either (unless they happen to be succesful enough in life to feel good with their path, which is not that easy, since they often meet difficulties in relationships and at job, see below). Analytical thinking can’t simply be applied to one thing alone, it sticks with you all the time. Although I know exceptions. Notably, some mathematicians. I don’t know if its a coincidence, or not. Second of all, the question of a job. People like that get bored easily. Its hard to keep them motivated as employees, unless they’re able to constantly do stuff they find interesting (which is almost never a thing in a regular job). Of course, what you already know stops to be interesting, unless there’s some more to explore. In a regular job, at some point, it’s not that obvious. Perhaps thats why people like that rarely get rich; rather, they become scientists or academics (at least the ones I know). I think that’s because those jobs give one a lot of freedom in choosing one’s field of work (at least in humanities; its much more difficult with hard science, when you’re often forced to do what’s available for you, e.g. taking an empty working slot in a big experiment), and also allow for a lot of changes over the years, in terms of the subject of one’s reasearch (I know many professors in humanities who started their careers doing one thing, switched to another, and another, and so on; academia is perhaps the only institution which doesn’t punish you for that, as long as you write a book in each case; its a regular thing, and it’s also a way not to get bored). I think those people find it much harder to just take a “normal” job and keep it."},{"instruction":"w much could I get for an Xbox 360 at a pawn shop?","output":"Go on eBay / Craigslist or whatever you prefer.

Should I decide my specialization during college or during graduate school? More specifically, what should I do to find my most interested area?","output":"Not too early and not too late. I have seen people pick a specialty early in college based on whatever popular science they were exposed to as a child, and this was not always a good fit, both in terms of personality and career prospects. I have also seen people who were paralyzed by FOMO and spent the first two years of graduate school searching for some mythical one true passion, while their peers had long been settled into a research group. It's a good idea to have a specialization in mind at the time you apply to graduate school, because that information will affect which programs you apply to, but this specialization does not necessarily need to be the one you pursued as an undergraduate. My advice for undergraduates who want to pursue a PhD Attend as many seminars, colloquia, and thesis presentations as you can in order to learn about the breadth of research out there. Pick something you can commit to for a year or more as an undergraduate. Research experience is important for gaining admissions into a PhD program, and it takes a serious time commitment to accomplish something in your research.If you figure out that you would enjoy a different specialization for your PhD, work with a trusted advisor to strategize which graduate schools to apply to. For example, if you worked in specialty A and want to switch to B, you might apply to graduate programs which are strong in both A and B and do not admit students to work for specific professors. Or you might apply to graduate programs where there are several professors working at the interface between A and B.Do not be scared of making a decision about a specialty and a research group once you get to graduate school. If you realize four years down the line that your choice is not an ideal match, you are not committed to it forever. If you stay in academia, you can veer towards your desired area as a postdoc or faculty. If you leave academia, your specialty probably won't matter much."},{"instruction":"w do homeless people survive?","output":"The same way they suffer the harsh summer."},{"instruction":"What are your views regarding getting a work visa in Canada?

What is expected from Government and what should people do on their part?","output":"May this problem become acute enough so that it doesn't become a chronic problem. Well such a crude way to begin your response. Self a volunteer for promoting RWH structures sometime back. Though it is a hot topic now, please do a research on the social media front and mass media front about the extent of coverage of any potential threat of water shortage a couple of months ago. Of course there are exceptions. Though we are blessed with adequate knowledge and skills that are required to address the problem, the lack is the attitude. Denial. It is not my problem. It for the government to set right things. The rain gods to be blamed. Everyone except me is responsible. Hence, this situation is a God sent one to do a course correction. Not everyone is unhappy. People involved in water business are elated. Understandably the huge demand for water makes them as big as they are. Short term solutions :treatment of water that leaves your compound either using microbes or by installing a proper black water recycling plant. Reuse this water again for toilet purposes. This action will considerably reduce the pressure. Because this is about 60% of our consumption. People who have installed RWH structures too have gone dry because of lack of proper rain in Chennai for couple of years. Black water harvesting is a round the year harvesting . Exnora has long released videos on microbes driven black water harvesting. Google “exnora indra Kumar”. You will find the information. Most of us did not implement black water harvesting because of the denial that we will not get water problem so acute or the concept takes more time for acceptance or trying to fix some one else responsible. Zero discharge house /appts is the need for the hour. (Google) Open wells as a recharging mechanism for rain water has found to be more useful for Chennai. Because it rains so heavily for a few days that it averages 140 cms since Chennai deluge. Open wells are more efficient as they can save a large quantity of water. Government has been indifferent such as public at large were too. The actions so far were more of optics than being efficient. We have converted the “tank district” chengalpattu district into water starving kanchepuram and tiruvallur districts. Water bodies have disappeared. Many of us live in the same place which was a water body a few years ago. Of course we have a valid patta and bought with our hard earned tax paid money. We have continued to extract water without replenishing with due structures. Government will do something just to tide us over the crisis. But unless the majority of us change the way we think about water, the water will continue to be a good commodity for trading. A water crisis like the current one will make it even “more profitable”. Will water management can become an election issue? Not sure. Because just like “oozhal” is not an issue but it is a way of life for the significant members of our society. So stop blaming. It is not going to take you anywhere. Many of us change their life style only after the first attack. Few of us are extremely careful. When few becomes the majority! We become a society of the healthy. For those who are interested to know if I have water problems, you guessed it right, it's No. Cheers Edit Desalination is an approach. It is cost intensive. Oflate the technology is becoming cheaper. But just like you and I are not keen in zero waste houses, government too is reluctant. Because “kadai thengai to vazhi pillayar” is a cheaper option. Extract water from agriculture wells and sell it for a premium.

This has happened, most likely, hundreds of thousands of times; for example the story of Vito Bertaldo, his unit was told to slow a German advance near a town called Hatten, his unit were told to find a position and they did. After the first few units entered the town, a German unit found the American position. When told to stop by one of the soldiers, they lay down their arms and looked like they were going to surrender, everyone in his squad left the house they were holed up in exept Vito, when they got near, the Germans pulled out pistols and shot the Americans trying to take their surrender. Enraged by this Vito left the house and shot them all, even though he was now alone in Hatten, he set up the squads B.A.R in a semi-covered position and held off repeated attacks.

These are known as exoplanets or extrasolar planets. Over the past few decades, astronomers have made numerous discoveries of exoplanets orbiting stars other than our Sun. Planets form through a process called planetary formation, which typically occurs within a protoplanetary disk—a rotating disk of gas and dust surrounding a young star. The gravitational interactions and collisions between particles in the disk lead to the formation of planetesimals (small planetary building blocks) that eventually grow into planets. Exoplanets can have a wide range of characteristics, including different sizes, compositions, and orbital configurations. Some exoplanets resemble those in our own solar system, while others have unique properties. They can be gas giants like Jupiter or rocky planets like Earth, and they can orbit close to their host star or at vast distances. The discovery of exoplanets has greatly expanded our understanding of planetary systems and the prevalence of planets in the universe. Scientists continue to study and explore exoplanets to learn more about their formation, composition, and potential habitability."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","output":"Getting started in competitive programming can be an exciting and rewarding journey. Here are some steps to help you get started: Learn Programming Basics: Before diving into competitive programming, make sure you have a good grasp of programming fundamentals and syntax in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, C++, Java). Familiarize yourself with loops, conditional statements, functions, arrays, and basic data structures.Understand Data Structures and Algorithms: Competitive programming heavily relies on data structures and algorithms. Study essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and common algorithms like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming. Practice implementing these data structures and algorithms from scratch.Choose a Platform: There are several online platforms that host competitive programming contests and provide practice problems. Some popular platforms include Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, HackerRank, and AtCoder. Choose one or more platforms that suit your interests and skill level.Start with Easy Problems: Begin with easy or introductory problems to get familiar with the platform's interface and the types of problems you'll encounter. Focus on understanding the problem statements and coming up with correct solutions before optimizing for speed.Analyze Solutions: After solving problems, take the time to analyze other participants' solutions. Understand different approaches and algorithms used to solve the same problem. This will expose you to new ideas and improve your problem-solving skills.Participate in Contests: Engage in regular coding contests on your chosen platform. Contests are a great way to test your skills under time pressure and simulate real competitive programming scenarios. Treat them as learning opportunities, and don't get discouraged by initial difficulties.Practice Regularly: Consistent practice is crucial to improving your skills. Set aside dedicated time for competitive programming practice, and challenge yourself with new problems regularly.Learn from Editorials and Tutorials: If you get stuck on a problem, read editorials or tutorials provided by the platform. These resources offer explanations of the problem's solution and alternate approaches.Participate in Virtual Contests: Many platforms allow you to participate in virtual contests, where you can attempt past contests at your own pace. Virtual contests are excellent for practice and learning without the time pressure of a live contest.Join a Community: Engage with the competitive programming community. Join online forums, discussion groups, or coding communities to learn from others, ask questions, and share your knowledge. Remember that competitive programming is a journey, and progress may take time. Be patient, stay persistent, and keep challenging yourself. As you solve more problems, you'll develop a valuable set of problem-solving skills and gain confidence in tackling coding challenges."},{"instruction":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","output":"You should read this book.

That is why a person cannot transform it on his own. After all how can the Ego create a new character it does not possess, it will only carry on with its current programming ie. nature? There needs to be an outside power to change such a person. The power that shaped the original individual Ego is the environment. To some extent the DNA of a person contributes to form a person’s nature but this too is the legacy of the ancestral environment. The environment is the source power that formed Mans Egoistic nature in the first place. Thereby, it would be logical that the same force can change our Egoistic Nature, i.e. by the environment. What is the most influential environment upon Humans? Non other than other human beings forming a person’s environment. This environment is created by a collection of human beings in proximity to the person. However, our minds are limited and subconsciously restricts the number of individuals contributing to our environment to impress us. Then it is possible to say, there are really only Ten or so significantly important people in our lives that influence us. Particularly those significant people in our typical daily life but the more importance we attribute to these people, the more they influence us to oppose any other counter veiling environments. As the saying goes, “You can’t choose your family but you can choose your friends.”. Hence, it is not so unsurprising to find a person’s inner circle of Friends and closest acquaintances influence him to help create his Nature. The more you hold these significant people as important and worthy of veneration. The more influenced by them you are likely be, to resemble their character traits. Hence, you can change Human Nature by selection of an environment and will even unconsciously resemble this collective’s morals and character traits, in summary their nature."},{"instruction":"false surrendering a war crime?

I think the connection between PETA, animal activists and humanitarians in general is: COMPASSION. Compassion makes you think a little further than what conservatives have learned in church, and all the “rules” they obey blindly, without questioning them or even understanding them. For example. It is cruel to punish a woman, and her baby, for their entire lives for an accident. A broken condom, a passionate night of love that both men and women are entitled to, a bade decision, a drunken night, or even worse, a rape. An unwanted baby is going to be miserable. I understand that it is a delicate topic with no obvious right answer. But the only one who can make the decision, is the pregnant woman. And let’s not forget that abortion is allowed before the baby is considered sentient. I know that pro-life, as they call themselves hypocritically, don’t understand this sort of things, it’s too complicated for them. Why do I claim they are hypocritical ? Because they don’t care about the babies, they just want to impose their religious beliefs onto others, that’s all. And there is nothing “pro-life” about that !

If you’re feeling nervous and stressed and end up overcomplicating things, your date may notice and it can potentially make things awkward before your date even begins.Create a strong first impression. Many think getting dressed up and showing up in your best outfit creates a strong first impression, but what can add to this is the impact you make by how you present yourself, how you talk, and how you engage with them.Finally, don’t try to force hugs or kisses and put them in an uncomfortable situation. The best is to go with the flow, and ask for consent!"},{"instruction":"Which asteroids are being mined for their valuable resources?","output":"Please accept my apology in advance for thinking your question is ABSURD. As of 2022/2023 NONE, and likely 10 to 30, 50 years ahead still NONE. Probably only “small sample” returns in the next 25 to 40 years to test technologies to develop better mining extraction methods and see what works best. Not yet economically feasible, and that “yet” part goes well into the future. Although there will be a point when it will happen. Specifically, As far as “industrial level” asteroid mining that competes with Earth mining of precious metals on a yearly tonnage basis: UNLESS YOU HAVE A 200 year LIFE SPAN YOU WON’T SEE THAT !!! NOT THIS CENTURY. We cannot yet mine asteroids on even a small testing scale yet. The mechanical tech, the transportation cost, and economies of scale, make it unfeasible for now and into the foreseeable future. For industrial “tonnages” that “equal” and “exceed” mining here on Earth, probably not till the “later part” of the 22nd century; perhaps. Or into the 23rd century. Until Fusion for use in space is fairly widespread, asteroid mining won’t happen on a “big industrial” scale. Human Fusion power and propulsion in space will not happen this century (I’d bet on that) . We will be lucky to get fusion power on Earth for commercial electricity by the end of this century, which would be great, even better and more green than hydro, wind and solar. The associated tech to mine is NOT like an I-phone or laptop. Its more “mechanical” and does not advance nearly as fast. Even charged deposition technologies still rely on mechanical machinery which needs testing and development in microgravity, which has not been done yet. Also chemical rockets (which is basically all we use, as our ion engine tech is anemic) are really not up to the transportation task of moving mined materials from asteroids. We need multi-megawatt powered Nuclear Electric Propulsion to even begin to make it feasible. Again, that technology does NOT advance as fast as computer tech and your next I-phone iteration does. Your looking at “multiple decades” ahead to develop these things just to working prototype stages, and multiple decades after that for the “real thing” . In the future, it might be possible to move a 100 meter wide asteroid from the asteroid belt to Earth Orbit at 10,000 kilometers or so, and try mining it in Earth orbit. We cannot do that yet. Much larger Space Economies of scale would be needed. The estimated cost for Starship is ONLY as advertised IF and only “IF” THOUSANDS of them are built. Ten or 20 or 50 per year will NOT give us the economies of scale needed. the claimsof 2, 4 or 6 million per launch are very (VERY) rosy and optimistic. Only possible if 10,000 were in operation and that’s 2016 dollars. It also takes much more than thousands of cheaper heavy lift rockets off Earth’s surface. Again, we need multi-megawatt powered Nuclear Electric Propulsion to even begin to make it feasible. A thousand Starship Heavy’s will not work back and forth to the asteroid belt. It would be like using bicycles to transport a 2,000 pound load per bike from Alaska to Southern Florida. It is more expensive at this point with chemical rockets and the faster propulsion technologies to move 500 and 1000 metric tons at a time are not well enough developed yet. It would literally cost much (much, much) more to just to transport gold, platinum and iridium from the asteroid belt to Earth (excluding the cost to develop to technologies that could actually begin to do it), that the gold, platinum and iridium would be worth on a gram per gram basis. Return of Investment would be HIGHLY “very” negative at this point in history. (Plus NOT feasible) Current estimated cost per kilogram with today’s technology to Psyche 16 in the asteroid belt and back to Earth with near future Space X Starship Heavy tech transport and mining techniques available near future, I estimate at around 10 million dollars per KG (4,54 million dollars/pound). Or about 10,000 dollars per gram of material. (a small paper clip is about 1.5 grams, so 15,000 dollars per paper clip). Dec 2nd 2022 Platinum is around 30 to 35 dollars per gram. Gold (24K) is around 57 to 59 dollars per gram iridium is around a 149 dollars per gram, So, mining the asteroid belt even for gold would be a HUGE loss on investment at this point in history. Current cost to orbit ranges from about 2,500 to 10,000 dollars per pound; The asteroid belt is much, much more expensive, because of the energy required and the hardware to get there and extract materials, then return to Earth. The tech to do that does NOT yet exist. What can and should be done in the next 20 years is targeting near Earth asteroids that come in the vicinity of Earth and the moon to test the best ways to extract sample materials from asteroids to test, develop and improve mining extraction technology in microgravity. This will take decades to develop. It’s not like the next I-phone iteration. Long very (LONG) term goals here.

They don’t fly far or fast enough to worry about how they may slip through the air smoothly, or not. Most of those are round-nosed, because that’s cheap to make, or “JHC”, Jacketed Hollow Cavity, which expand like the dickens when flesh is hit at distances under 50 yards.

Here are some key differences between Angular and AngularJS: Architecture: AngularJS: AngularJS is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It allows bidirectional data binding, where changes in the model automatically update the view and vice versa. Angular: Angular uses a more advanced architectural pattern called the Component-Based Architecture. It follows a hierarchy of components where each component has its own logic, view, and styling. Angular also uses a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows from parent components to child components. Language: AngularJS: AngularJS uses JavaScript for development. Angular: Angular is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript introduces features such as static typing, interfaces, and classes, which enhance the development process and catch errors at compile-time. Performance: AngularJS: AngularJS applications can sometimes suffer from performance issues due to its two-way data binding and the way it manages the DOM (Document Object Model). Large applications can experience slower rendering and updates. Angular: Angular provides a more optimized and performant framework. It uses a concept called change detection, which efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the DOM. Additionally, Angular applications are typically compiled ahead of time (AOT) to improve performance. Dependency Injection: AngularJS: AngularJS has a basic dependency injection system, but it is not as robust or standardized as in Angular. Angular: Angular has a powerful and built-in dependency injection system. It allows for better modularity, testability, and code reusability by providing dependencies to components and services. Tooling and Ecosystem: AngularJS: AngularJS has been around for a longer time, so it has a mature ecosystem with a wide range of plugins, libraries, and community support. Angular: Angular has a comprehensive tooling ecosystem that includes the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) for scaffolding and building projects, as well as a rich collection of libraries and extensions. Community and Support: AngularJS: AngularJS has a large and active community, but it has been in maintenance mode since the release of Angular. Angular: Angular has a vibrant and growing community with regular updates, extensive documentation, and ongoing development by Google and the community. It's worth noting that Angular is the successor to AngularJS and introduced several breaking changes. Therefore, migrating an AngularJS application to Angular may require significant effort and code modifications."},{"instruction":"What is cosmetic dentistry and how is it different from general dentistry?","output":"Cosmetic dentistry combines both art and science to give you a healthy, aesthetic, flawless smile.

Who is telling the truth?","output":"Any corporation that wants to deal with the EU in future will be very wary, and will make sure that their contracts have additional protections in place. This is because the EU have proven themselves to be untrustworthy, and Ursula, Procurement Queen of f*ck ups, has not been held to account yet. The leaders of countries within Europe have either lied about vaccines (Macron), or deflected attention to the UK (who have no control of what corporations do, other than to get on board and work with them early, even before they knew the efficacy of any vaccine). The EU wanted to show their power as a big block to get a good price. All it showed was their power to delay things during a pandemic, which is tragic. The lies just increased vaccine scepticism, especially in a country like France, which was already wary of vaccines, making Macron a complete moron in my book. The power play just shows how power corrupts, and it becomes all about the government and nothing to do with looking after the people they represent. If Novavax are wary I am not surprised. NB: All the authorised vaccines have a similar efficacy rate. When it shows a higher efficacy for Pfizor than other vaccines, it is because Pfizor testing was done only in the USA, only in the early days with the original virus (before mutations), and only during the summer months. The other vaccines were tested in various places around the world, later in the season, and in areas where the mutations were already in place. Therefore these issues affected their efficacy rates, and would have affected Pfizors too if they had the same varied pattern of testing. With regards to protection against serious reaction to the virus, requiring hospital treatment, and therefore deaths, then all the vaccines have the same excellent results.

In the book, Aemond is Aegon’s number one supporter and the brothers seems close with each other but both of them are problematic people so their closeness is not actually on the levels of Robb and Jon, but still, they would kill and they would die for each other. Aemond betraying Aegon doesn’t make any sense and it would just butcher the show even further. Taking away all of Alicent’s ambitions, whitewashing Rhaenyra, presenting Daemon as a cool guy and making Rhaenys kill hundreds of people just for show, ruined most of things already. I am not even going to mention about Laenor’s surprised survival. Changing this would be a huge strike to the book and I would understand if GRRM would never allow again the use of his books like this. Aemond even ruled as the Prince Regent and the Protector of the Realm when Aegon was deeply wounded and after had to leave the city. He always protected his brother’s back, always supported him. Did he think he would be a better king? Yes. Would he be a better king? Definetely yes. He even said so himself in the show but that’s it. I’m sure Stannis thought he would be a better king than Robert but he never betrayed him, never even thought about betraying him and Aemond is closer with Aegon than Stannis is closer with Robert. Aemond might come off as a person with anger issues and rightly so. He’s been bullied for 10 years and then mutilated by his bully and traumatized by the lack of reaction -except his mother. He is deeply devoted to his family, especially loves and cares about his mother. His love for his family might be his one redeeming quality (I mean he has tons of it for the people who has the ability of emphaty). I truly hope they don’t change that. But I think they will do another thing, they will make Jaehaerys and Jaehaera happens to be Aemond’s kids with Helaena and maybe Maelor too. But I don’t see this happening behind Aegon’s back since never mind of Aemond, Helaena is not someone like this. I think we will see some kind of an arragement or maybe what they have will be only platonic but Aemond will see those kids like they are his own. Like the way Criston stepped up for them in the past. He will be this cool uncle/replacement father but either way I am thinking the Blood&Cheese incident will be worse than it was in the books. Well, if they will not turn that into a misunderstanding to whitewash Rhaenyra&Daemon even further. The show had already change the dynamics and made the Blacks drew the first blood and actively start the war but they will not even acknowladge that. So let’s hope they would at least stay true to Aegon and Aemond’s relationship."},{"instruction":"What is the best defence against ransomware?","output":"In my experience, one of the best antivirus solutions is Surfshark.

For many years, their recycling facilities have been so effective that they have importet garbage from other parts of Europe.It is not one, but several systemsSome get recylced, like metal, batteries, glass and so.Waste is separated for different end purpose.The rest, well _—→ the rest get burned in a “waste burner”, and the heat is used for district heating. Or is is heat networks in english ? Some are compressed, so volume sent to landfill is reduced. Today, waste that do end up in landfills, are compressed, and pretty solid.substances that has toxins, or might be harmfull, are handled as such.(There was a law against landfills in 2009 in Norway, but “processed” waste, can get a permit for landfilling. But then it is more or less “ash” and such ) Potential dangerous and toxic waste, are handled in a separate site.That is a smaller volume, since most companies that has toxic waste usually will do something to reduce the volume. (You have to pay, for all dangerous/toxic waste. cost is significant )We have site like that in Norway and Sweden. It can be everything from radiactive isotopes, to heavy metals, mercury substance and so on.Some large towns have their own recycling sites, other work togheter and share the cost of such sites. And, some “waste” is also recylced in to new “topsoil”, and sold as such.(mixed as such product where some come from recyle sources ) Are there issues ? Yes, I will name just a few. Burning waste to get district heating might replace energy made from coal, oil, gas and such. But, even if you handle emissions, you will still get some CO2 and other compounds that will emitt into the atmosphere.(Yes, “some” emissions are removed ) It might be a good idea some places, but maybe not if you look on this issue in a long timeframe. Lets say +100 years. Why ? As I see it, we have billions of tonns of “new” materials, metals, glass, and so on that has to be supplied each year. On a global scale.That is not sustainable in the long run…. !_______________________________________________ Burning waste, might solve some problems here and now.But, it will not solve the need to reduce global production of “new” materials. _________________________________________________ That is a challange, maybe not from a “climate viewpoint” but it might be a challange if we want to keep the biodiversity here on this planet. We do today, have an “environmental pressure” as I see it, on virgin land, forrests, rain forrests and so on… Because there is a global demand for more “new” materials. We will not be able to adress those challanges, if we build sites like this all over the globe.BUT, Burning waste, and use the heat for district heating might be a good idea for “some” volume of waste.That is something, that should be discussed locally and balance pros and cons. As I see it. Thats why I recently argued against using billions on removing CO2 from a waste burner in Oslo. Because it might undermine other recycling projects, and then undermine a development where you gradually increase % of material in the society that are recycled in the years to come. If we do not do this.I am afraid that the pressure on land area that today are forrest and space for wild life, will increase over time.In the oil and gas sector, some think that the % from oil and gas used for raw materials. Will get 3X higher on a global scale the next 40 years. From an environmental view, that might work. If care is taken each place you get oil/gas up from the ground.(As we have done in the North sea. Last 50 years, there has been an significant increase in bio diversity. Sea water has a higer oxygen level, and is less polluted. Measuring station around the north sea has documented this. ) BUT, 3X increase in timber, metals from mines, cotton production, and more…Hm.. no, that will not work everywhere on this globe, and might be a disaster for many species. So, I would say, learn from our mistakes, and pick what is working well, regards to recycling solutions here in Scandinavia and Europe. One recycling project I do like, are recycling of used glassware, into a “foamed glass substance” used for both isolating roads foundation, and fire proofing in tunnels and building. (Tested to 900 degree C ) Some ideas might look good there and then.. (I have had many of those.. )And then, after some time, you see that it was maybe not perfect after all. We learn, we evovle, and we redo, and invent something better… I did visit a site in Holland a few years back.They had cleand up a river, in Germany and holland.There was now a huge area for wild life, the water was once again clean for the first time in generations.So, in EU, people some places talk about “reconstruction” of nature.and the huge debate, are on reintroduce predators, like wolfs and such in some places.But it is a step in the right direction, that we have such debates. Here in Norway we are a bit behind in such questions. Sweden is followin EU in this matter, but they have had debate on this. (and some still argue… a lot of emotions.. ) In EU, there are also a project on recycling of electronics I would mention, and the polymer manufacturers are developing new polymers, and new chemicals, that are better in regards to recycling. (Designed for recycling.. ) Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark are each having their own solutions for the future.Finland are building a huge nuclear power plant generation 3++. Denmark are workning on Thorium reactors, so is Netherlands. Norway focus a lot on removing CO2 emissions, and hydrogen productions.(Have put millions of tonns of CO2 underground of seabed since 1990s ) Sweden…. well, they have a lot of projects, but it looks like they will keep the nuclear plants. And improving solutions around waste burning. Denmark do have some solutions around removing micro plastic from waste water, and if I remeber correct, some in Sweden also work on this.(Sorry, but my memory is not what is used to be… my memory used to be “instant”, so some details I would have to look up. This will give you a “picture” of scandinavia I hope, when it comes to waste handling ) One other argument against what we do today, is that a huge volume is shipped around.Moving large volumes, gives emissions in it self.A lot is moved with trains, that are electric and power comes from hydro-electric sources. So, not too much emissions.Some come from trucks and boats, and there we do have emissions. _________________________________________ Today, the focus is a bit too much on “climate gases”.And not so much on preserving biodiversity and the environment. That is sad, because it started very well for +30 years ago…Some where the last 30 years, the focus shifted, and the environmental issues got less focus.I think this is wrong, and we have driftet of the road slightly. I do think, that we will find our way back and focus more on the environmental issues in the years to come.. (I hope ) I have a link below.To Swedish public site.Here you can find a lot of details around waste management in Sweden.(How it is done, statistics and so on… and yes it is in English ) I hope you can understand my frustration a bit. For many years, the focus has been a bit too low on the environmentle issues, but change takes time.I do understand that, but change is never easy. I do have a studied scientific management also, and should understand “change” more than many others… but still, this is a complex matter, and a difficult task, if you ask me.I hope this was some helpfull, and can give some answer to you.

It all depends on what you need. For example, some photographers need a powerful organizing tool; some need one-click creative effects and inspiration; some require the technical quality that only the best RAW processing can provide. And some, of course, need the detailed retouching and powerful compositing tools of a traditional photo editor. So before you read further, please identify why you need it for. If you are a professional photographer or photo editor, then Photoshop or Affinity photo are your best choice. However, If you need a photo editor for personal use, like posting your pictures on Instagram or something, then Luminar AI is the best fit for you. So Let me help you understand. Photoshop It is impossible that you haven't heard of Photoshop in photo editing. Photoshop was introduced in 1988, and since then, It is known as the trademark of industry standard in photo editing. Even people started using the word Photoshop to describe editing an image. It is the most advanced image editing software capable of everything from simple retouching to complex 3D designs and illustrations. The possibilities are endless as it has many features and tools. I've been in the photo editing and retouching industry for 5 years now, and so far, it is the best photo editing software I've found! Photoshop has a significant learning Curve; I remember when I started in this industry, it took me over 3 months to learn photo editing. But the best part is that there are tons of channels on youtube that can teach you how to use Photoshop and do excellent photo editing and the best ones include Phlearn, Piximperfect, Photoshop Training Channel, etc. I love photoshop and can write a whole blog post talking about it, but the only thing I certainly hate about it is its subscription fee. So if you want to be a professional photographer or photo editor and are not bothered by its little monthly subscription, then I highly recommend you to go for photoshop. Affinity Photo To be very honest, I hate monthly subscriptions (Netflix is the only exception), which brings me to Affinity photo. It was released in 2015 and is commonly known as the alternative to Adobe Photoshop. It is well accepted by professionals and common users due to its high performance and low price. There is almost nothing you can do in Photoshop that you can't do in Affinity photo & the best part is that it has no subscription fee. You only have to pay a single payment, and you get the software for a lifetime; not only that, but all the future updates will also be free. The tools and user interface of Affinity photo are very similar to Photoshop; if you've been using photoshop for a while, using affinity photo wouldn't be hard for you all. However, it focuses particularly heavily on the retouching market, with cloning, healing, and retouching tools, and Inpainting tool for automatic object removal, a dedicated frequency separation filter with both gaussian blur and median blur for effortless frequency separation, and a dedicated Liquify persona (workspace) for localized image distortion effects. I use both Affinity photo and photoshop. To show you that Affinity photo is as powerful as Photoshop, here is a picture that I've retouched in Affinity Photo. Luminar Neo Photoshop used to be the only serious game in town, but today there are many decent options, some paid-for, some free. These range from simple programs designed for quick tweaks to images to sophisticated tools designed for professional image editors and everything in between, and one such tool is Luminar Neo. Luminar has quickly grown to become one of the best software for photo editing worldwide. It is certainly not as powerful as Photoshop or Affinity photo, but it is very easy to use and has a clean user interface, unlike Photoshop or Affinity Photo. In addition, it is famous for its Ai-based slider that allows you to make your Image amazing just by using simple sliders. My favorite Luminar feature is the Ai sky replacement tool that replaces that sky with just a single click, and the best part is that you can choose the sky of your choice. Other cool features include the Ai portrait and Ai skin feature; these features are very beneficial for portraits. You can smooth out the skin, whiten teeth, make lips lighter or darken, make them pink, change eye color, Erlangen eyes, enhance eyes, and make a face and body slimmer, all with simple sliders. It also has an Ai accent filter that can give excellent results (by adjusting shadows, highlights, contrast, tone, exposure, saturation, details, color correction, white balance, and others) with just a single click. I like another feature in Luminar, the \\"Ai powerline remover,\\" and it does exactly what is said with just a single click; this feature can come in handy for your street or outdoor photos you want to post on Instagram. I use this software as a photoshop plugin. I use it mainly for final touch-ups in my images, like adding a specific color grade, creating a certain mood, or enhancing the overall colors in the Image, and I must say the results are always excellent. The good news is that it does not have a subscription; you can get it for only 79. So if you want to edit your Personal Images like a pro, then this is the best choice for you; you don't need the complex editing of photoshop. It can do all the things you need quickly and effortlessly."},{"instruction":"What is the best defence against ransomware?","output":"Are you looking for an antivirus for your Android device that will keep it secure?

And some brands or models are offered with or without an external safety. For instance, since I’ve used a 1911 quite a lot, I’m used to using an external safety. When I bought a Glock 17, it took time to get used to not needing to “thumb off” the safety when preparing to fire. It slowed me down because I felt I’d missed deactivating the safety until I got used to the G17. When I bought a new M&P pistol from the S&W line, I opted for their 15 round subcompact model, with the optional thumb safety. S&W M&P 2.0, subcompact, 9mm, 3.6″ barrel, 15 round magazine with thumb safety. Since the Glock 17 first debuted, many manufacturers have used the same concept of Glock’s trigger to make striker-fired pistols. The lever on the trigger is a “safety” of sorts because it prevents the gun from being fired unless the lever is depressed. There are a few specialty companies that make external safety mechanisms for some of the more common Glock pistols. However, adding these non-factory devices will void any warranty offered by Glock. Dangers of adding an after-market safety device Any time you fire your gun and damage property, injure or kill another person, expect police to confiscate your firearm for the investigation. They will examine the gun and document that it was modified with an “added safety.” And it will be tested to determine if it’s working properly or not. While it may seem to show you were “safety conscious” it also gives a prosecutor or a plaintiff’s civil attorney something to point out to a jury. If it fails to work properly in testing, it can be used against you. It will add time and cost to your legal fees to defend against such an attack (testing, expert witnesses, etc.). Even if it worked properly, the other side can argue “defendant modified the gun for his own purposes by adding parts the factory engineers thought unnecessary and potentially unsafe.” What are your reasons? Before thinking you’ll add a safety to a pistol, ask yourself why you want to do it. Especially when some very good pistols offer a factory option of a manual safety and/or a double-action only (DAO) version. Perhaps it’s a home defense gun and you have children or others in the home who aren’t familiar with guns or gun safety. Or is it that someone told you the Glock, Springfield XD or brand ‘X’ is the “best” pistol, but you want one with a manual safety? For the above, I’d suggest you look for guns with a factory installed manual safety that suits you. There are a number of excellent pistols you can choose from. Is it because you don’t feel comfortable carrying one without a manual safety? Does your job including openly wearing a firearm, such as security, law enforcement, armored car guard? In either of the cases above, you can improve your comfort level by selecting a proper-fitting holster with a covered trigger guard and perhaps a thumb-break retention strap.

It's important to note that these perspectives may not apply universally and do not represent the views of all Freemasons. Here are some commonly mentioned disadvantages: Misconceptions and Suspicion: Freemasonry has often been shrouded in mystery and secrecy, leading to misconceptions and suspicion from outsiders. Conspiracy theories and unfounded allegations have perpetuated negative stereotypes about Freemasons, potentially leading to social stigma and misunderstandings.Membership Requirements and Selection Process: Freemasonry typically has a membership selection process that involves initiation rituals and the requirement of belief in a higher power. This can be a barrier for individuals who do not meet these criteria or who are uncomfortable with the secretive nature of the initiation process.Time Commitment: Freemasonry involves regular meetings and participation in lodge activities. This commitment may require a significant amount of time, which can be challenging for individuals with busy schedules or other commitments.Financial Obligations: Membership in Freemasonry often entails financial obligations, such as dues and contributions to charitable causes. While these contributions are generally voluntary, they can represent an additional financial burden for some individuals.Lack of Gender Inclusivity: Historically, Freemasonry has been a male-only organization. While there are now some lodges that admit women, the majority of Freemasonry remains exclusively male. This gender exclusivity has been a point of criticism for those advocating for gender equality and inclusivity.Limited Transparency: Freemasonry maintains a certain level of secrecy regarding its rituals, teachings, and internal operations. This lack of transparency can create a sense of exclusivity and suspicion among those who are not part of the organization.Potential Conflict with Personal Beliefs: Freemasonry's requirement of belief in a higher power may clash with the beliefs or principles held by some individuals. Those who identify as atheists or hold non-theistic worldviews may find it incompatible with their personal philosophies. It is worth noting that Freemasonry also has its advantages, which include fostering a sense of community, promoting personal growth, and providing opportunities for philanthropy and charitable work. Ultimately, whether the disadvantages outweigh the advantages is subjective and depends on an individual's personal values and perspective.

This will help to remove any imperfections and create a smooth surface for the finish to adhere to. Wood Filler: If there are any dents or scratches in the wood, use a wood filler to fill in the gaps. After filling in the gaps, let the filler dry and sand it down until it is flush with the surface of the wood. Clean the surface: Clean the surface of the furniture with a clean cloth to remove any dust or debris. Apply the Finish: Apply a coat of wood conditioner to the furniture to help the wood absorb the finish evenly. After the conditioner has dried, apply a coat of your chosen finish with a brush, roller or spray gun, following the manufacturer's instructions. Allow the finish to dry completely before sanding again with a fine grit sandpaper. Reapply the Finish: After the first coat of finish has dried, reapply the finish with the same method as before. This time, sand the surface lightly between coats to create a smooth surface. Finishing touches: Once you have applied enough coats of finish, let it dry for at least 24 hours.

It is the first vital to comprehend the distinctive sorts of fragrance, and how they associate with one's skin, before picking the careful kind of smell that suits a person. The primary contrast between the sorts of fragrance lies in the centralization of forces. The request of the most astounding to least fixation is first Perfume, second, Eau de Parfum, third, Eau de Toilette, and fourth Eau de Cologne. Scent items are made out of creature and plant-based fragrant mixes or esters (or their man-made counterparts), broken up in a blend of liquor and water. The proportion of scented matter (called \\"fragrance oil\\" or \\"essential fragrance\\") to solvable figures out if the item is a fragrance, eau de toilette, and so on. Parfum - additionally called concentrate or extract scent - is the most focused or purest type of a fragrance item, and is the longest-enduring on the skin. All things considered, it is additionally the most costly. A genuine parfum (fragrance) will contain 15 percent or all the more (normally up to 30 percent) of the vital scent. Eau de Toilette, then again, with up to a 10% fragrance fixation, is a lighter, all the more invigorating fragrance, and exceptionally suitable especially for hotter atmospheres. Eau de Toilette, nonetheless, fades away a touch speedier than Eau de Parfum. Eau de Cologne, has up to a 7% scent fixation. It is reviving for more smoking atmospheres and can be re-applied as required because of the quick dissipation. Eau de Cologne is sold in bigger parts and has a tendency to be the least costly scent. Fragrances are traditionally characterized as a blend of top, heart, and base notes discharged over a time frame. The top notes are the first fragrance discharged by a scent. After the top notes have blurred, the center or heart notes of a fragrance get to be detectable.

With a mind boggling twist towards the climax that get's both not only Aamir and Salman confused on who real Raveena is, but also the audience.Andaz Apna Apna’s climax was an amalgamation of some hilarious situational comedy, well developed pratfalls, brilliant writing, and superb performances on the part of its actors. You just cannot get enough of Salman Khan and Shakti Kapoor pretentiously whacking each other with their bums, or the two Paresh Rawals having an identity quarrel “Teja main hoon, mark idhar hai” only to be interrupted by Shakti Kapoor’s now famous “Ye Teja Teja kya hai, ye Teja Teja?”, or even Tiku Talsania (as the cop) quipping demurely “Line mein khade ho jao sab … arey ye to line mein hi khade hai!” Some climax stills from the movie: Here's 3 minute scene from it's half an hour of climax to make you stop scrolling quora and get a good laugh! :D And if you have some more time, here's some more laugh for you from the climax!

So let's start back then when hashirama fought madara he begged tobirama to yield he literally warned him to stop because he grew up with tobirama and therefore knows tobirama was a even bigger threat than madara he was more ruthless than madara and he would show to mercy to anyone who post a threat especially the uchiha clan. Now before madara got the ems he was equal to izuna in every way possible and tobirama easily messed izuna up so madara would be no different. Now the ems madara would be trouble if he uses perfect susanoo but if tobirama manages to tag madara the susanoo can't protect you from his wrath plus again the sharingan can't track faster movement especially one from a flying thunder god jutsu. Again tobirama is from a senju clan therefore ashura descendants therefore he inherited a strong chakra and life fore and can fight longer than madara just like hashirama plus tobirama has edo-tensei and he can summon numerous strong shinobi to keep madara busy and then slash him the way he did izuna. Now during the fourth shinobi war tobirama attempt a surprise attack madara but to no avail people seem to think madara was stronger but no because he said both brothers lost their speed due to them being edo-tensei and we all know edo-tensei are weaker than the original deal plus madara was alive and has hashirama’s regenerative abilities plus sagemode and rinnegan which gave him the edge.

That was a time when computers would have 16k of memory; the amount of instructions you could run was limited and the amount of code you could fit was limited too. As such for efficiency, companies would establish hard limits on the code size, and as such, was easier to handle payments because you would pay per line of code written. It is similar to what you may see in some industries like voiceover: the actor is paid per sentence acted; since you are going to use only a finite amount of sentences and words per assignment. Today, this is not feasible because you would need 3x the number of workers, just to check constrains and validate the lines that each programmer write.

Standard Hindi was born out of the Hindi movement in colonial India (19th century), spearheaded by the Brahmin classes which sought to replace Persian or Arabic origin words with Sanskrit borrowings. That said, all of the proponents of Hindi were well-versed in Urdu, and you can even find many traces of this history in Standard Hindi today. Some of these traces include: • Spoken Hindi/Hindustani (not the dialects subsumed under Hindi such as Bhojpuri and Awadhi) is closer to Standard Urdu than it is Standard Hindi • Hindi orthography (in Devanagari) reflects certain conventions that make more sense in the Nastaliq script, but owing to the fact that the first Hindi writers were originally Urdu writers, such conventions carried through (ex. गहरा instead of गेहरा, वह instead of वोह) • Sanskrit noun borrowings use the same gender their Persian or Arabic origin equivalents use in Urdu (ex. the borrowing ‘Rashtra’ (state) is feminine, as is ‘Riyasat’) • Standard Urdu is intelligible to Hindi speakers while Standard Hindi is generally not intelligible to Urdu speakers Hope this helps!"},{"instruction":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","output":"Thank you for the question , this is a video shared on YouTube about inspirational and motivational quotes , this is the video :"},{"instruction":"What is the cheapest country to visit from India?","output":"1.

The yin and yang of the band Styx included Dennis DeYoung on keyboards with an artistic flair, and Tommy Shaw who wanted to rock out. They always have had their tensions, but upon release of the huge single from Kilroy Was Here, the theatrical Mr. Roboto, things came completely unraveled. Shaw has the band name today, and Dennis tours separately as well playing the songs he was on. An Australian rock band had similar rifting happen when Supertramp got their big hit album Breakfast in America in 1979. Roger Hodgson had always been the artistic drive and principal songwriter for the band, but that album produced several hit singles including one not primarily written by him, Goodbye Stranger. Members of the band wanted to become a more commercial sound and get more hits like that, while Roger always steered away from commercial bent. This led to Roger going on solo tours and Supertramp continuing on without him.

Utilizing punctuation to your benefit. I love the “dash”--it can separate an idea or thought without chopping it up into two distinct sentences. It acts as more of a pause, but has a theatrical effect. My favorite way to convey a story is to have it play out the way you would envision a movie taking place. This brings me to point number 2. 2. In addition believe showing vs telling is key to good writing. No one wants to read word for word a description of something as if they are reading a diary--it’s more exciting if a description comes through the eyes of a character doing something or through an action scene. Again think of creating a story like the way you see a movie. 3. But what every person really should know about writing is learn to develop your voice. Your voice is like your brand, and it should be as recognizable as the McDonald's golden arches, or the BMW checkered flag. Your voice is something derived from years of writing. It’s not something that comes instantly. When people read my books my hope is that in a blind taste test, they recognize the style of writing even without knowing I am the author."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

One time we sat on a bench we’d sat on many, many times before. I forget which one of us saw it first, but there was a small, black pouch on the ground under the bench.

Experiments have been done—and I assume probably still are—-with animal and plant DNA while still in developing stages, that is after fertilization but before full development starts. However as controversial as even that experimentation has been over the decades, there is absolutely no way to do so ethically with humans. And there is no known way to manipulate a grown human’s DNA in such a manner as to cause it to start replicating the “new programming.” Even experiments on lower mammals faced great backlash, and the process of implanting the fertilized eggs with the changed DNA was troublesome. Not to mention that outcomes would be iffy at best; there are just too many variables. Plants and animals that utilize external fertilization are much easier, cause no trauma, have shorter gestation times, the effects are easier to control, and the outcomes are more positive. To manipulate human genetics would mean starting either before fertilization or just after, then fertilizing a willing surrogate with the genetically manipulated zygote via in vitro. There is no guarantee it would work and if prior mammal experiments are any indicator, odds are it would not. Miscarriages are far higher than average, and the more foreign the material that was introduced, the faster the miscarriage occurred. If cross species were used the egg simply would not implant at all, the surrogate would pass it right back out again. The major problem with trying all of this in humans is that it stinks of eugenics, and nobody with a stitch of ethics wants to go anywhere near that mess. This would, however, make a pretty interesting premise for fiction—a story/novel or film, or a cool graphic novel—-if you could figure out a way to explain away the replication problem (although most readers would probably be fine with suspending their disbelief on that point if you could surround it with enough solid science on all the other points). For awhile in college I had a work-study job in a zoology lab. My boss was the Special Projects Director of the Zoology Dept, and the lab I worked in was where he was working on these exact kinds of experiments with Zebrafish. It was fascinating, he‘s very smart (obviously), and we got to socializing after I lost my work-study. We became casual friends and because of my interest in the project he told me about other projects that had been attempted that were very similar. He was pretty idealistic and was excited about the idea of being able to potentially end world hunger via these methods. These projects were funded primarily with grants and private funding rather than through university funds, but if the uni provided the space and some of the materials, then students could work on the projects as part of their curriculum. I wasn’t majoring in any of the sciences which normally would have gotten me the job but got lucky through the work/study program. That’s where I learned about this stuff, mostly through my association with my former boss. And this is just one small university in a small town, back in the early 1990s.

This indicates that on a per capita basis, Bangladesh has a higher level of economic prosperity than Pakistan. However, it is important to note that economic indicators alone do not provide a complete picture of a country's overall well-being or development. Other factors such as health, education, inequality, and social stability also play a crucial role in determining a country's level of prosperity. Furthermore, both Bangladesh and Pakistan face their own unique challenges and have made progress in different areas. For example, Bangladesh has made significant strides in reducing poverty and improving access to education and healthcare, while Pakistan has a more developed industrial sector and a larger economy. Therefore, while Bangladesh may be considered more prosperous than Pakistan based on certain economic indicators, it is difficult to make a definitive comparison between the two countries without considering other factors."},{"instruction":"Which cryptocurrency has the lowest transaction fees?","output":"There is no definitive answer to which cryptocurrency has the cheapest transaction fees as transaction fees can vary depending on several factors, including the network's current congestion, the type of transaction, and the size of the transaction.

The proxy server plays the most important role in providing security. Client computers connect to proxy servers and request various resources on the internet, such as web pages, games, videos, MP3s, eBooks. After the proxy server receives the request from the proxy server, the proxy server searches for those resources from the cache to the local hard disk. If those resources are first cached, then the proxy servers will send them to the requesting computer directly on the requesting computer. If it is not cached, it will connect to the related server and the client will request resources from the side of the computer. This will then cache the resources from the remote server, and send the client the content that has been recovered. The proxy server can optionally change the response to the client or the response to the server for some possible purposes. One advantage of a proxy server is that its cache can serve all users. When one or more Internet sites that are coming up frequently, these proxies are stored in the cache, so that the response time of the user request increases. In addition, the proxy keeps the logs of these interactions, which helps in troubleshooting. Here's a simple example of how a proxy server works When a proxy server receives a request for an internet resource (such as a web page), it first searches it in cached pages in its local cache. If those pages are found in the cache then they send them directly to the user without sending a request to the internet. If those pages are not in the cache, then the proxy server acts as a client on behalf of the user and uses their own IP address to request the page from the server on the Internet. When the requested pages come to the proxy server, then they send them to the user. For the user, the proxy server is invisible; All incoming internet queries and incoming replies appear directly with the addressed Internet server. More at.

Here in the United States I would probably be characterized as a Democratic Socialist. In Europe I’d be what’s known as a Social Democrat, and a fairly moderate version of that political animal. I believe that successful modern societies must come up with a mixture of capitalism and socialism. Perhaps someday we’ll come up with something better, but I don’t think that’s going to happen for quite awhile. Capitalism does incentivize innovation. Socialism can deal with aspects of civilized society where a profit based system isn’t appropriate. In some circles, in the US, this makes me wildly radical. There are those who would accuse me of being a communist. Politically speaking, the United States is very conservative. I think the country at large is much less so. One of the reasons we’re so politically conservative is that one of our two dominant parties, the Republicans, has to appeal to a large hard-right block in their base. Through gerrymandering, effective propaganda and rather archaic forms of political representation, like the Electoral College, a minority is able to influence today’s politics disproportionally. For over a decade a majority of voters has repeatedly lost elections at local, state and national levels. But no matter how you slice it, the Democratic Party here in the US isn’t a far-left entity. For most of my voting life it’s been more like Republican Lite than radical left by a good bit. When folks would characterize President Obama as a radical socialist I’d laugh. He governed as a slightly right-of-center moderate. His incremental moves to the left merely brought us toward the center of the political spectrum. Liberals have scored some cultural victories. Take gay marriage. This victory didn’t come about through legislation. It came about because a solid majority of Americans felt that any right they had access to should be accessible to all citizens. A conservative Supreme Court agreed. It wasn’t about politics, it was about fairness. Yet, there is still a sizable minority that doesn’t feel every American is worthy of all the freedoms they enjoy. The liberal Democrats I know are not out to turn the US into a socialist state. They believe as I do that a balance should be struck between capitalism and socialism. And in fact, that dynamic exists today in this country. If you support the military don’t forget that the United States Army is a government program. So is the Navy and the Air Force. The Democratic Party of 2019 isn’t far-left. It isn’t radical. It’s moving slightly left of center after years in the political wilderness.

If you need a really stable source with 10^-8 drift, then Direct Digital Synthesis would be required. Analog Device AD9833 comes to mind here. It is well-described in the AllAboutCircuits article. [LINKED_TEXT: How to Build Your Own Function Generator Using Analog Devices’ AD9833 - ProjectsTired of using your PC or mobile phone as a signal generator? It’s time to upgrade to a standalone one by making it yourself. https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-DIY-waveform-generator-analog-devices-ad9833-ATmega328p/] [URL: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-DIY-waveform-generator-analog-devices-ad9833-ATmega328p/]The AD9833 is a bit of a beast; it’s entirely programmed rather than set up with timing R and C. So if you’re not into digital, it may not be what you want. On the other hand it cannot be beat for stability and bit depth. If you are looking for a proper ARB (arbitrary waveform generator) then you may wish to read this thread on Dave Jones’ EEVblog’s forum. [LINKED_TEXT: Looking for DDS generator chip with arbitrary waveformAnalog Devices make some nice and quite cheap DDS synthesizer chips, like the AD9833 or AD9834 , which easily allow you to output a sine wave at a pre-programmed frequency. But what if you don't want a sine; you wanted some other shape? I imagined someone would make a chip similar, but uses RAM instead of the hard-coded sine function ROM, which would then allow you to make any custom wave shape at any frequency. But I'm having trouble finding anything at all like that. I'm aware of the AD9102, which has a \\"pattern RAM\\" inside. But it can't do waveform generation out of that; it uses that for a programmed pattern of frequency or phase modulations of its (fixed sine) DDS engine. I know fancy solutions to this often involve a high-speed DAC connected to an FPGA, but that involves serious amounts of money and development software/hardware to create such an FPGA. Does anyone do a pre-made chip for it?https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/looking-for-dds-generator-chip-with-arbitrary-waveform/] [URL: https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/looking-for-dds-generator-chip-with-arbitrary-waveform/]Regards, Tony Barry"},{"instruction":"Can we bake a cake in a glass bowl?","output":"Yeah if it's microven proof or bakeproof !!"},{"instruction":"What are the best street foods in India?","output":"I live in Mumbai, which is known for its street food.

Almost everyone on the internet seems to think that men are incapable of keeping their apartments clean. The sad truth is, that most single men do not pay attention to their home hygiene. And most men who are husbands and fathers don’t seem to be pulling their weight enough when it comes to home cleaning chores. We need to change this, stat. Because real men clean. No matter what age or stage of life you are at, it is not okay to have clothes strewn around, leave dishes piled in the sink for days, walk away from a wet towel bundled up on the floor, or simply leave wrappers and takeout containers around to rot. Leaving things strewn around will only end up with a huge pile of chores after a while. And let’s face it, no one loves chores. Instead, tidy up after yourself every day. Pop socks and dirty laundry in a basket, do your dishes after every meal and throw away dirty takeout containers before you hit the sheets. Doing these little tasks, which may take about two minutes at best, will leave you with much less to do on cleaning day. If you’re a dad, this will encourage your little ones to follow the same steps. Ideally a home would be cleaned properly twice a week. However, if your schedule doesn’t allow it, pick a [LINKED_TEXT: genius products] [URL: https://beamymart.com/5-genius-products-thatll-hack-everyday-life/] cleaning day and keep it fixed every week.

No! Everyone needs to stop listening to the quantum woo paddlers! Quantum uncertainty has nothing to do with conscious beings looking in boxes to see whether the cat is dead. It has to do with trying to measure things as if they had properties that they don’t really have. Quanta are not particles, and they are not waves. They are quanta. They can be made to display wave-like or particle-like properties. But a quantum doesn’t have a specific velocity or position like a ping pong ball.

The problem is, taking a cold shower in the morning absolutely sucks. A low-hanging fruit that also works—after you brush your teeth, run cold water over your hands and forearms. Try to let the cold water touch lots of skin and keep it running over, holding the position, then, put your face down into the sink and let the cold water go over your face. Hold it for 5–10 seconds and I guarantee you’ll wake up more. Not only that, cold water causes a dopamine release that has no crash (falling below baseline dopamine). Caffeine works too (I still drink it) but it’s a form of borrowing energy from the future. Coldwater and sunlight are the healthiest ways to wake up. I can’t give in to sunlight though.

This is not specifically Canadian problem, it pertains to any immigration. The average monthly amount for a new Canada Pension Plan retirement pension (taken at age 65) is approximately 644 per month (7,732 per year), and private employer pensions are very rare. The OAS (old Age Security) would give you - in best case scenario(working full time for 20 years with average salary of, say, 80,000/years) - additional 8–9K. There is an old age income supplement but its only designed to get you to the poverty level. The total will be less than 20,000/year in benefits. Some portion of this pension - namely, OAS - is NOT payable outside Canada if you have not resided in Canada for at least 40 years. Yes, you could continue working past 65 - but don’t count on it.

In essence, HP ammunition has two interrelated purposes: to increase its size once within the target, thus maximizing tissue damage and blood loss or shock, and by remaining in the target to expend all of its kinetic energy in the target, some of which will be lost if the bullet continues through the target.

I visited 4 cities of Bhutan other than it's border town of Phuentsholing and my suggestion/travel tips are based on that only. Here are some travel tips - Tip 1. Don't go Yes, don't go if you are interested in destinations. Bhutan is about the journey. It's about enjoying the serenity, enjoying every moment of your travel, meeting new people. All you want is a picture atop a mountain with a monastery in the backdrop? You don't have to go through the immigration process for that, such scenic views are in India also. Tip 2. Plan according to Bhutan time When I went there it was almost 3:30 pm IST on a Friday evening. Their immigration office works only up to 4pm. So I had only half an hour left to get my papers verified right? Wrong. I only have half hour to see the office helpers clean the building coz all the officials have left. Tip 3. Permit The permit the office issues at the border town is only for Paro and Timphu… this is the best advise you're gonna get - go to Paro first. Go to Timphu, apply for your route extension to other cities early morning then after you cover Timphu, come back to the office and collect your extension permit. Tip 4. Carry enough cash You may find 24 hour ATMs in some major cities but I didn't find them when I was short on cash. Also you have to inform your Indian bank before such travel so they make your card usable in a foreign country. I was so miserably short on cash with no ATMs open on either side of the border at 2:30 am that I was forced to stay with my taxi driver until the next morning. Not that I didn't enjoy this experience, but my spine disagreed with me the next day. :) Cheers and have a safe trip. Thats the end of this answer.

A grateful king bestowed lands and title upon Llewellyn the Great, a Knight in North Wales. Among the gifts was a wolfhound puppy. The puppy grew up and became Llewellyn's favourite hunting hound. One day Llewellyn came home to discover his infant son's cradle was overturned and child was missing. Gelert appeared with his mouth stained with blood. Believing the hound had killed and eaten the child, Llewellyn drew his sword and plunged it into Gelert's breast. The hound's dying howl woke the infant child, who was found alive and unhurt under the upturned cradle, safe from the jaws of the monstrous wolf lying dead beside him. Llewellyn was horrified when the truth dawned. Mighty Gelert had killed the wolf and saved the child, but he had killed his son's saviour.

Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method wherein a store doesn't actually stock the products it sells. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item directly from a third party, like AliExpress. This third party then ships this item directly to the customer who purchased it. Not holding inventory means not spending money on products that might not sell. Only buy from a third party what you’ve already sold for profit. Profitable? Yes, only if you do it right.

The water of the Gihon Spring would fill up a pool outside the city walls. And another part of the water would travel through Hezekiah’s Tunnel system to fill up the Pool of Siloam. I labeled the image below for better understanding. And as Josh Korn pointed out The essence of the issue, as the picture shows, is that the Gihon Spring was outside the natural line of the eastern wall of the city, on a slope that made protecting it difficult and consequently exposing the city to siege. Rumours of a threat of just such a siege, emanating from Sennacherib the Assyrian king, are what motivated Hezekiah to order the construction of the tunnel. But there was also a “municipal” reason for the tunnel’s construction. Since ancient Jerusalem (in your picture) was built on a slope, if you lived near the bottom of the hill, you had to make a long trek uphill every morning to get water. Of course, the poor lived in the lower parts of the city, so the advent of water in the Shiloach pool was a pretty good democratizer of a basic resource. After the First Temple was built, everybody except King Solomon had to walk up a reasonably steep incline to get there. That’s the core concept of Aliyah (meaning “ascent”). It’s something you only really understand by physically making the trek back up from the Shiloach Pool."},{"instruction":"w can I learn a dance? I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance.

The deficit may bounce around a little (see top chart below, which shows Trump’s deficits under his tax bill), but we haven’t had a balanced budget since Clinton, and are not likely to ever get one again. The national debt is now at 22 Trillion (see second chart above). There is no appetite in American government to rein it in. At the end of the last century, Clinton had an exceptional economy, growing at 4% or more each year (see third chart, with blue bars, above). There is no indication that we will ever get growth like that again — at least under Trump. Even with all his tax cuts and regulation-killing, Trump didn’t even break 3% in 2018. Both parties spend like hellcats on “defense.” Medicare and Medicaid costs are exploding as Americans age and go into nursing homes. Interest on the debt will soon take a staggering chunk of our tax dollars: By 2028 we will be spending a Trillion on interest on the debt, a Trillion on “defense,” a Trillion on Medicare and Medicaid, and another Trillion on the rest. The budget deficit will continue to break the Trillion mark. Social Security will likely remain solvent, based on past performance and legislation. But fear not! America has only recently exceeded the dreaded 1:1 debt-to-GDP ratio, whereas Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 240%, and they are still surviving. (Greece failed when it hit just a 150% debt-to-GDP ratio, but that’s a different story.) So on a relative basis we probably still have a ways to go before economic calamity. But economic calamity is coming. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats care about the debt and our fiscal path is unsustainable. Don’t buy into the “debt can be good” rhetoric: the kind of debt and interest on that debt that is now hitting America is truly a blight. At some point America will default, probably within the next 25 - 30 years. The rich will go to other countries with their loot, converted to other currencies.

Generally speaking, it is related to bacteria that builds up in the mouth and on the teeth—it is usually caused by poor oral hygiene or other underlying health problems. In some cases, bad breath simply means that your dog needs a good dental cleaning. Poor oral hygiene can lead to plaque buildup which produces odors from decay as well as contributing to other types of problems such as gum disease. In addition to poor oral hygiene, there are several medical conditions that may cause bad breath in dogs such as diabetes or kidney disease; these conditions make it difficult for your pup’s body to process certain proteins in their diet which create a distinct odor from the mouth. Other digestive issues like acid reflux and gastrointestinal diseases with inflammation may also result in pungent odors coming from your furry friend’s mouth. Finally, food allergies may also play a role; if your pooch has an allergy to something they eat regularly (like beef) their digestion may suffer creating unpleasant smells when they exhale or even drool excessively creating more bacteria growth in the mouth area leading to foul odors too!

What happens to a material if its Poisson’s ratio changes from negative to positive value?","output":"Poisson's ratio is a measure of the relationship between the change in lateral dimension of a material and the change in its axial dimension when subjected to an axial load. It is expressed as a fraction, where the numerator is the change in the lateral dimension and the denominator is the change in the axial dimension. Poisson's ratio can have a value between 0 and 0.5, with a value of 0 indicating that a material does not undergo lateral expansion, and a value of 0.5 indicating that the lateral expansion is equal to the axial compression. In some materials, Poisson's ratio is negative, meaning that the lateral expansion is in the opposite direction to the axial compression. If a material's Poisson's ratio changes from a negative to a positive value, it means that the material has undergone a change in its mechanical properties. This can be due to factors such as changes in temperature, stress, or composition. In general, a change in Poisson's ratio can have significant implications for the behavior of a material under load, as it affects its ability to deform and absorb energy. For example, a material with a low Poisson's ratio is generally stiffer and stronger, while a material with a high Poisson's ratio is more ductile and capable of absorbing more energy before failure. Understanding the behavior of a material in response to changes in its Poisson's ratio is an important aspect of materials science and engineering, and is essential for the design and optimization of many products and structures."},{"instruction":"What large predators still live in Europe?","output":"– Wolves. After a time in which wolves went (almost) completely extinct throughout most of Europe due to over-hunting and conflicts with farmers, eventually conservation efforts prevented the species from reaching total extinction, reintroduced captive individuals to most remote regions (like Mercantour National Park, in southwestern France), and protected these wolves so well that their populations rebounded for the first time since the 18th century, rising to around 12,000–30,000 individuals or more, and recolonizing all of their historical ranges (including the woods surrounding Paris). – Lynxes. Today, there are no lions nor tigers in Europe, so another feline has come to fill the void: it’s the Eurasian lynx, the largest of all lynx subspecies (around 18–30 kg). Despite their vulnerability to deforestation, conflicts with farmers and poaching, Eurasian lynxes still have a wide range and a stable population of around 8,000–30,000 individuals living in the forests of Western Europe (including Spain and France), all the way to Russia. – Brown bears. Brown bears were once distributed throughout Europe, but pressure from over-hunting and habitat loss reduced their range and populations drastically – in France and Spain, the species is only found in the Pyrénées mountain range (around 30–250 individuals), but even in this stronghold, bears remain greatly threatened because of poaching and ever-increasing conflicts with farmers, as well as the locals’ lack of will to protect them. As such, bears face an uncertain future in Western Europe. On the other hand, bears are faring rather well in Eastern Europe, rising to around 500–5,000 individuals that thrive in their forest ranges thanks to heavy conservation efforts – and these populations are only increasing nowadays. It is worthy to note that all these three predators are still found in mainland Europe (including Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland among others), but not in the United Kingdom, where wolves, bears and lynxes remain absent since the 16th century; however, reintroduction projects are in talks of being arranged."},{"instruction":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","output":"PEOPLE STAY IN UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE They lost their true identityThey suffering from low self-esteemThey are not financially independentBecause of societal pressureBecause of childrenThey want to teach him/her a lessonThey can't imagine their partner with othersThey think God change him/her in futureThey are manipulated by their partnerThey think they deserve it"},{"instruction":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","output":"Reduce Money Expenses How can we reduce our money expenses? 2 / 2 ChatGPT Reducing money expenses can be achieved through a combination of smart financial planning, budgeting, and adopting frugal habits. Here are some effective strategies to help you reduce your expenses: Create a budget: Start by tracking your income and expenses. Identify areas where you can cut back or eliminate unnecessary spending. Allocate a specific amount for different categories, such as housing, transportation, groceries, entertainment, etc.Cut discretionary spending: Analyze your expenses and identify non-essential items or services that you can live without. This might include dining out less frequently, reducing entertainment expenses, or canceling unused subscriptions.Prioritize needs over wants: Distinguish between your needs and wants. Focus on fulfilling your basic necessities first, such as food, shelter, utilities, and healthcare, before indulging in discretionary purchases.Reduce utility costs: Conserve energy by turning off lights when not in use, unplugging electronics, using energy-efficient appliances, and adjusting your thermostat to save on heating and cooling expenses. Additionally, consider reducing water consumption to lower your water bill.Cook meals at home: Dining out or ordering takeout can be expensive. Instead, plan your meals, prepare food at home, and pack lunch for work or school. This will not only save money but also enable you to eat healthier.Use public transportation or carpool: Transportation costs can be significant. Whenever possible, opt for public transportation, carpool with colleagues or friends, or consider cycling or walking if feasible.

Compare prices from different providers, adjust coverage limits if appropriate, and inquire about discounts for bundling multiple policies.Minimize impulse buying: Impulse purchases can quickly accumulate and strain your budget. Before making a purchase, take a moment to evaluate if it's a genuine need or a fleeting desire. Consider waiting for a day or two to decide if you still want the item.Negotiate bills and contracts: Contact your service providers, such as cable, internet, or phone companies, and negotiate better rates or switch to more affordable plans. Similarly, negotiate with your credit card companies for lower interest rates or seek better deals on insurance premiums.DIY and embrace thrifty habits: Whenever possible, take a do-it-yourself approach. Learn basic home repairs, maintenance tasks, or simple car maintenance. Explore thrift stores, garage sales, and online marketplaces for second-hand items or discounted goods. Remember, reducing expenses requires discipline and a willingness to make changes to your spending habits. It's important to regularly review and adjust your budget as needed, while always keeping your long-term financial goals in mind."},{"instruction":"the Bible against abortion?","output":"No"},{"instruction":"w do I get a smooth finishing on wooden furniture?","output":"Getting a smooth finish on wooden furniture requires a combination of proper preparation, technique, and the right tools and materials. Here are some steps you can take to achieve a smooth finish on your wooden furniture: Sand the wood: Before applying any finish, it's important to sand the wood to remove any rough spots, scratches, or imperfections. Start with a coarse sandpaper (around 100 grit) and gradually work your way up to a finer grit (around 220 grit). This will ensure a smooth and even surface.Fill any gaps or cracks: If there are any gaps or cracks in the wood, fill them with wood filler and allow it to dry completely. Sand the filled areas until they are level with the rest of the wood.Apply a wood conditioner: If you are working with porous wood such as pine or maple, it's a good idea to apply a wood conditioner before staining or painting. This will help prevent the wood from absorbing too much stain or paint, which can lead to an uneven finish.Apply a stain or paint: Apply a stain or paint to the wood, following the manufacturer's instructions. Use a high-quality brush or sprayer and work in thin, even coats. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next.Sand between coats: After each coat has dried, use a fine-grit sandpaper (around 220 grit) to lightly sand the surface. This will help remove any bumps or imperfections and create a smooth surface for the next coat.Apply a clear coat: Once the final coat of stain or paint has dried, apply a clear coat such as polyurethane or lacquer to protect the finish and create a smooth, glossy surface. Use a high-quality brush or sprayer and apply thin, even coats. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next. By following these steps and taking your time, you can achieve a smooth and professional-looking finish on your wooden furniture."},{"instruction":"it okay to leave a dead fish in an aquarium?","output":"No because the body decomposing can easily lead to an ammonia spike that can kill everything else in the aquarium.

The thought that if you don't eat within 30 minutes of working out, everything you trained goes down the drain. Wow! And I used to believe this!

However, instead of it being 30 minutes its more like hours and hours. Your body isn't going to stop absorbing nutrients at 30:01 minutes after training, so relax. If you really want to maximize post-workout nutrition then this is what you want to be feeding your body: Protein Eat around 1/5 of your daily protein intake within 3 hours of exercise.You can divide that amount to be half before workout and half after workout.For me, it would be around 40g of protein in total! I’d eat 20g before and 20g after Carbs Eat around 1.5g of carbs per kilogram of body weight within 3 hours of working out. You can divide this as well - half before and half after.Carbs post workout increase glycogen storage.Carbs are delicious Fat Avoid too much of your fat intake after working out.10g or below after working out seems like a smart strategy Now, what you eat is up to you.

Why or why not?","output":"Nope. This is the same concept as God. First of all, after reading many answers I came to the conclusion that “There is no perfect Definition of Karma” It’s vary from person to person depending upon their experiences. What is Karma? (Google definition) (in Hinduism and Buddhism) the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence is viewed as deciding their fate in future existences. Let’s break down it into two parts: 1st part: The fate of a person is being decided by his actions in this life and his past life. How could a person's past life affect his present life? Isn’t it Nonsense? There is no past life. It’s just garbage created by so-called ******. When they don’t have answers and they automatically bring the concept called “Past Actions” How foolish it is to believe such lame concepts. How could a person's past deeds affect life actions affect his present life? There is truth in it. We should accept it. But, doesn’t happen to everyone? Nope. If we do good deeds they will reciprocate. It’s true up to some extent. But at the end of the day, humans are humans. (I will write about it in the next paragraph.) 2nd Part: Decides fate in future existences? Another foolish concept like Past life. (Image source: Google) Does Karma happen to everyone? Osama Bin Laden, a heinous terrorist, died at the age of 55 happily (a single headshot). Do you think it’s karma? If yes, Then answer this A good and beautiful lady was attacked with Acid by her boyfriend as she wasn’t accepting his love. Is it Karma? What’s the mistake done by her? Does she deserve this? or Children being born to Alcoholic, Abusive, Non-concerned fathers. What do you say? or A person helped his friend in need but later one ditched him when he needs help. Now?? Conclusion: If any good happens to good ones, there is God. If bad happens, nobody questions God. Nobody is there to answer. If bad things happen to bad people, Karma does exist. If bad things happen to good people, No one mentions Karma. Now also, there is No one to answer. That’s why karma is a similar concept to God. Vary from one to one. Once you accept “Good and bad events happen to everybody and part of life”, then there is no point in believing concepts like “Karma & God” “If you are good, there are high chances of life being good to you”. That’s the simple funda of life. Whether you call it Karma, Goodness, Nature or Real life, it's up to you. ~V!"},{"instruction":"Why do people spread the fake news that Indian demonetization was a failure?","output":"You Are Victim of Fake News!

One thing that was prevalient among multiple societies is that a tyrannical leader would disarm the people “for their own good\\", before instigating a fully tyrannical approach. It was easier to take over when your victim lacks the means to fight back. I don't fully remember which of the older societies fell victim to it, but a more modern example was Hitler's occupation of Nazi Germany. The people were disarmed, and by the time they wanted to fight back, they either couldn't due to a lack of weaponry, or wouldn't out of fear. The first thing a tyrant does is disarm the people, because a victim that can't fight back is easy to control. There is also the fact that the Constitution doesn't give you any rights. It states the rights you own as a human being, and that the purpose of the government is to protect these rights. A man has the right to bear arms to defend himself, his family, and his property. Against the individual, or the country in which he presides. To infringe upon one of your rights is to eventually take them all, which might have been prevented if they had protested the first right stolen."},{"instruction":"w do I get the birth certificate for my child?","output":"How to Get a Birth Certificate in India if Not Registered Here is how one can get a birth certificate.

Most businesses utilize content marketing and even the one who don’t are using it now because: it drives growth. What’s even better is that there’s continued demand for content writers because content marketing is on the rise. Businesses of all shapes and sizes keep investing in content marketing and 95% of marketers using content marketing plan to continue investing the same amount in the channel in 2023. Just look at Spider-man. This is spectacular content marketing from Marvel working at best. It is a content writer/content creator like you that came up with this character and his story. He’s the best in the industry and is the one and only: Stan Lee. This means being in the field is not only a good idea but also a good avenue for generating revenue. You can never go wrong with content marketing because it is constantly experiencing exponential growth. Organizations always have some sort of marketing efforts which means they need talented individuals like you to create their marketing material. The world of content marketing is also very competitive but that is not the reason why content writers have a hard time getting clients. The problem is that most content writers don’t know how to: a. Stand out. b. Market themselves effectively. With that being said, I’m going to show you exactly how to beat the competition, attract high-value clients and generate revenue for your business. Create a freelance website for your content writing business: Some content writers prefer to avoid the competition by following the long route of getting clients. They create a freelance website for their business. The advantage of this is that it makes you stand out and brings writing clients to you instead of the other way around. The problem is that it takes time to build a successful website because that generates leads. DUH, it’s a website. (Credit by Giphy) The key to creating a website that gets clients is to: have a good design that is not distracting (basic) and shows your branding, create content consistently using your blog that ranks on the SERPs using high search volume keywords (this helps you build a high-quality portfolio and learn how to write quickly), have a CTA at the end of every content you publish. A good example is getting your leads to either call you directly or book a time to speak with you about their content marketing needs. A perfect example of websites you can take inspiration from is: Ryan Robinson blog, Neil Patel, WebFX, Jordan Makelle, Smartblogger, Elna Cain and Copyblogger. Building a successful blog takes time so keep that in mind. 2. Freelancing platforms: Another option is to join freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer, FlexJobs, Toptal, and more. These sites do the heavy lifting of attracting clients to their platforms. The only downside is the steep competition. These sites have millions of other content writers just like you, trying to get clients. Plus there’s every service imaginable in there from content writing, copywriting, lead generation, sales, voice over and more. The key is to create an attractive profile that lists the services you offer. Then try everything you can to rank your gigs. Once you’re successful, clients will reach out to you directly. (Credit by CY Partners) 3. Job boards: Job boards list jobs of different categories across several industries. Businesses looking to hire professionals usually post their job openings on these sites which is where you come in. Just search for content writing jobs and then filter your search to reflect what you’re looking for. Are you looking for remote content writing jobs that are full-time or contract? You can get that. Filter your search across a variety of parameters such as location specific (country, worldwide, or remote), job level (full-time, part-time, contract, freelance) or experience level (entry level, intermediate, senior, advanced) and more. Some job boards you can use include Problogger, Indeed, SimplyHired, Google for Jobs, FlexJobs, Glassdoor, Linkedin Jobs and more. 4. Cold Outreach: A strategy that I rely on which is very effective is sending out cold emails to brands, blogs, or websites I want to work with. This is a good strategy if you don’t want to follow the long route by waiting for clients to come to you which takes time. A LONG TIME. Here, you are being proactive because you’re reaching out to people who might be interested in the services you’re offering. The key to making this work is in three folds: Reaching out to people who fit your target profile and are looking for your services. If you’re a content writer, specialization is the way to go. People rarely want professionals who can write every single type of content. They want a specific type of content writer. Are you a blog writer? Maybe you can reach out to blogs. Or perhaps you write sales copy such as landing pages. You can reach out to brands. You also need to target prospects in a certain niche such as digital marketing agencies, SaaS companies, e-commerce stores, personal finance blogs, you name it. Then comes identifying prospects who are actually looking for your services. You can inspect your prospect to understand how frequently they create the type of content you offer. If you create copy for landing pages, a good idea would be to consider ecommerce stores or other brands that bring out a shit ton of products. Apple for example produces new products all the damn time. If you write blog posts, consider blogs that create a shit ton of blog posts, like Smartblogger or Neil Patel. But what I found out is that reaching out to businesses who post content writing jobs works best. Not only are they looking for my services right now, they are also willing to pay. So I reach out to them with cold emails and it works. (Credit by VoilaNorbert) Personalization is a non-negotiable deal when it comes to sending cold emails to prospects. This shows the prospects that you not only know them, you’re also willing to do your homework properly. Call them with their first name and include their company name. Then find out something that is very recent and relevant about the person you’re reaching out to and include that in the body of your email. Did they got hired for a new position? Are they about to roll out a product update? Or perhaps they just published a new blog post. Include this in your email. Linkedin and Crunchbase are your best friends for finding recent and vital info about your prospects. Also, don’t forget to throw in a compliment.Email outreach is a numbers game whether you like it or not. As much as anyone might tell you that sending out a small amount of super personalized high-quality cold emails is what gets the job done, I’ll tell you they are right and wrong at the same time. Yes, sending out high-quality cold emails will get you high open rates, reads and responses. But they might not get you high conversion rates (booked meetings). Let me give you an example: Over the past couple of months, I reached out to VCs and Angel investors to contribute to an article I was writing about. The article would help start-ups looking to fundraise from high net worth individuals like these on how to best approach them and raise money from them successfully. An initial email I sent was to 22 VCs and angel investors that were highly vetted by me (quick to respond and gave in pitches to websites before), and the email was highly personalized. The result: Only 1 person responded with his pitch and I needed a minimum of 5. Obviously it meant there is only one way to get what I want: send out more emails like this. Eventually, and after sending a total of 105 emails, I got 6 pitches from them. And voila! I finally made this article - [LINKED_TEXT: What VC’s Look for In a Pitch] [URL: https://medium.com/financegeek/what-venture-capitalists-look-for-in-a-pitch-10122fec4ea]. Yes they are highly qualified and yes the email is personalized. But what do you think will happen if I focused on the initial 22 emails? I’ll still get only one pitch. The secret to getting fast results with cold emails is focusing on quantity while maintaining quality. Don’t believe me. Just ask the expert, Alex Berman who has generated over 10 million dollars for his agency using cold emails. To get content writing clients fast (in like a week or 2) using cold emails, try sending out 50 - 100 emails per day. But the higher the better as long as you won’t sacrifice the quality of the emails you send. If you can’t send 100 highly-personalized cold emails everyday, send any amount you can maintain. I find 25 to be a moderate number that still gets results even though it’s slow. You can start with 25 as long as you’ll commit to sending 25 emails every day."},{"instruction":"What are your views regarding getting a work visa in Canada?

But we must be merciless! You can not spend small stocks. Threats people drive away. Let hunger complete what lead could not do.” “The headquarters and staff company are moving to the neighboring village of Gorshkovo. January 19, 1942 We quickly arrived by car to Golovino, where I had to prepare the room. Cheerless thoughts were when the front line moved, saw tank ditches, far-reaching wire fences. Why all this? It is a pity to leave the area to this dirty, ragged people. Yesterday, the sky in many places turned blood red. Flamed villages set on fire. This is done in order to take away from the Reds climbing forward any opportunity to warm up and find any supplies. Dirty houses are devoured by a flame. The war is merciless, it means - we or they! \\"- from the diary of the lieutenant of the 185th infantry regiment of the 87th infantry division of the Wehrmacht G. Linke. I can add that in winter ALL peasants and citizens were evicted by Germans from their homes in combatant zone, and at retreat the houses were burnt. Town Gatchina near Leningrad on liberation had a population of 80 persons. Stalin did not order to burn Moscow. He did not leave it during the Moscow battle. Once he visited the front near Moscow, spent the night in peasant’s house and ordered to pay overnight charge. P.S. On November 17, 1941, the secret Order of the Headquarters of the Supreme High Command No. 0428 “... Destroy and burn down all settlements in the rear of the German troops ...” appeared. At that time German troops were standing on a tram stop 15 km from Kremlin. Report about a fulfilment of the order 0428 \\"COMRADE STALIN, COMRADE SHAPOSHNIKOV Pursuant to Order No. 0428 of November 17 on arson of settlements, the Military Council immediately took the following measures: 1. In divisions and regiments, they began to form teams of hunters, who in most of them are already active. 2. In the territory occupied by the enemy, intelligence agencies of a special department sent sabotage groups, with a total number of up to 500 people. 3. The armies were assigned a squadron of R-5 and U-2 aircraft, a total of 45 aircraft. 4. Manufactured and allocated to parts of individual incendiary means - termite fuses, balls, cylinders, checkers - with a total of 4,300 units. 5. Over 100,000 Molotov cocktails and accessories for their use have been issued. 7. The points to be burned and destroyed for each army were approved, and assignments were established, in connection with this, to the combat arms (aviation, artillery, teams of hunters, sabotage and partisan detachments). Over the past time, 398 settlements were burned and destroyed, of which: in the 30 army - 105, 16 - 113, 5 - 55, 33 - 17, 43 - 24, 29 - 52, 50 - 32 points. Most of the points were burned and destroyed by teams of hunters and sabotage groups; the artillery due to the lack of incendiary shells, and aviation did not conduct active work on the assignment due to bad weather. The active work of units of the front to set fire to settlements caused serious damage to the Germans, as evidenced by the following, intercepted by us, order of the German command: \\"According to a report from headquarters 57 ak, it has been established that in recent years systematic arson of settlements has been carried out in many places by individuals and groups penetrating the front line. It is necessary to increase control over the movement of civilians and strengthen security at the cantonment sites.\\" Work on the implementation of the order No. 0428 continues in all parts of the front.

Respondent is the highest paying online survey option I’ve found. [LINKED_TEXT: Respondent - Sign upRespondent.io connects you with your target audience for market research interviews.

Respondent is a company that pays you to participate in research studies. Their structure is much different than most online survey sites and apps. Respondent facilitates one-on-one consumer research studies and focus groups, both in-person and online. Respondent works both with individuals responding to surveys as well as companies and organizations looking for feedback. In fact, I took it as a positive sign that their homepage is actually business-facing: That shows they’re prioritizing getting new customers — the companies that need research done. In contrast, most low-paying survey sites target you, the survey taker. How Does [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to Respondent | www.respondent.io] [URL: http://respondent.io/] Work? If getting paid for your opinion sounds like fun, [LINKED_TEXT: create a free Respondent account today] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087]. Since the site seems to have more a business/professional focus, I signed up with my LinkedIn account. You’ll enter some personal information and then you will see various surveys based on your background. It only takes a couple of minutes to set up your account and then you can start earning money. Let’s take a deeper look at the process. Sign Up Process [LINKED_TEXT: Sign Up] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087] You can either sign up with your email address or with an existing social media account. Since the site seems to have more a business focus, I signed up with my LinkedIn account. From there, Respondent collects personal information from you. This includes your name, birth date, home address, email address, and phone number. This is pretty standard stuff that every survey site will ask for. Companies completing research want to make sure they’re reaching specific audiences. These are designed to match you up with the best / most relevant surveys. They do this by asking for demographic information, including: GenderEthnicityEducation Background Filling out the necessary information should only take you a few minutes. Once you are done, you’ll end up on the main page of your account. You’ll immediately see “Marketplace Projects”, which are the surveys Respondent offers. Who is Eligible to Join? Anyone 18 or older is eligible to [LINKED_TEXT: sign up] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087] as a Respondent. From what I can tell, most studies are targeting US residents, but the site claims to have international opportunities as well. You’ll also need a PayPal account (so you can get paid!), and either a Facebook or LinkedIn profile to verify your identity. Filtering and Selecting Projects on Respondent Once you’re logged in, you’re presented with all your different project options. You can see how much they pay, how long they’ll take, and what type of study it is. Use the sidebar filters to further narrow down your options. Gotta love the “Remote” checkbox! I can answer questions from home? Yes please. Types of Studies on Respondent Respondent offers a variety of project types. Let’s take a quick look at some examples of typical projects available through Respondent. The screenshot might be kind of hard to read, but there are studies for: people interested in investing – 75 for 45 minutessupply chain professionals – 50 for 60 minutessmall business owners – 85 for 60 minutesonline banking customers – 50 for 60 minutesand more All of the projects clearly mark how long it should take to finish and how much it pays. There is also a brief description of what they are looking for in a respondent. Many of Respondent’s projects seem to have a small business or technology focus, but there are broader consumer studies that also pop up. For the most part, projects pay well, but there are also lower paying surveys too. You can decide if it’s worth your time or not. Projects can vary in their setup. It depends on the specific company that is in charge of the project. Most are one-on-one discussions with a company representative. Others require you to keep a log of certain activities over multiple days or weeks. The first study I participated in through Respondent was a 200 in-person focus group. These are just some examples of what you might see the more you apply and are approved for projects in Respondent. Project Screening Once you find a project you like, you can click on it and apply. To apply, you’ll need to fill out a brief screener survey to ensure you are the right fit. This usually takes less than 5 minutes to complete. Respondent has more stringent requirements to get picked for surveys. This sets Respondent apart from other survey sites and is also why they pay more. Companies are looking for honest feedback from the right people. The website will display a match score of 0-100 based on the results of your initial survey. If the company wants you for their project, they’ll reach out through Respondent’s system. Being chosen for projects isn’t as easy with Respondent as other sites, even if you’re a good match. You could end up applying for several projects before getting picked. You can see these in your dashboard if you click on “My Surveys”: I just finished one screener survey and it gave me a match score of 91%, so I imagine if the company can’t find anyone better-qualified, I’ll get a call. (I was “100% Qualified” for the focus group I was chosen for.) My 200 [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to Respondent | www.respondent.io] [URL: http://respondent.io/] Focus Group Like I mentioned above, my first “hit” with Respondent was for an in-person focus group near me. Well, it was about 45 minutes away, which did eat into my effective hourly rate. But I wanted to go to see what it was all about. The study targeted small business owners and the company wanted to learn more about our accounting and bookkeeping processes. (As an Excel-junkie, I was shocked to learn my fellow panel participants still employed the “receipts in a drawer” method!) It was a really interesting experience, part of which included building a model of our businesses out of Legos: Yes, I really got paid to play with Legos! How Much Money Does Respondent Pay? According to Respondent, the average payout for a completed project is 140 an hour. This makes Respondent the best paying [LINKED_TEXT: online survey company] [URL: https://app.respondent.io/r/sammuthanah-13e1fe511087] I’ve come across. As you can see from the examples above though, not every project pays that much. My focus group was 200 for 2 hours. (100 an hour if reducing fractions hurts your brain.) All payments from Respondent are made via Paypal. Payments are usually processed within 8-10 days, which isn’t bad at all. My payment actually took more than 3 weeks to arrive, which was a little annoying, but it did eventually show up. [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to Respondent | www.respondent.io] [URL: http://respondent.io/] Fees? Respondents are paid the cash incentive amount advertised by the researcher minus a 5% fee (or a 1 fulfillment fee, whichever is higher). The 5% fee is for payment processing as well as a service fee for facilitating projects. So my 200 turned into 190 by the time it hit my PayPal account. Fees are clearly marked on the initial screener survey of all projects. You can view your payment status under the “My Surveys” tab. Other Ways To Earn Money With Respondent Not only can you earn money by completely surveys with Respondent, but you can also earn money for referring your friends. If you know someone who would be a good fit for studies like these, send them an invite and earn 20-50 when they complete the study. Grab your unique referral link under the “My Referrals” tab in your account. Best Practices for Earning Money with Respondent To maximize your time and earnings with Respondent, it’s a good idea to follow these best practices. Set a Calendar Reminder Set a reminder to log in weekly to check for new studies. Unlike other survey sites, Respondent doesn’t proactively message members to let them know about new opportunities. Or at least they don’t send them very often. So far this year, I’ve received two emails with my “personalized research studies.” Decide Quickly If you see a project you like, fill out the screener survey immediately. As you might guess, remote studies fill up quicker than in-person ones. Respondent will also show you which studies are “over subscribed,” meaning they have more willing participants than they need. Don’t waste your time applying for those. Be Honest When filling out the screener survey, answer questions honestly. This may eliminate you from certain projects, but the goal is to maximize your time by only participating in the best surveys for you. This helps you and the companies seeking feedback.

There are only two solutions to this problem: The attitude of people should be changed and should exhibit basic manners in public areas.The next solution in which I have found to be working.Book your seat in the last row where behind is the wall or the projector room.Book for the row of the seat that comes after a particular section a so of the picture below. This is the only other section of the row where no one else could disturb keeping their foot, sometimes disgusting foot over our seats and watch the movie peacefully. These are something I thought while going through these worst experiences. If you too agree for the same or have experienced the same someday kindly upvote & follow my quora page.

This is a generous person who does good at the expense of his future births. Financially, they may have debts, incomplete education, lack of favorable professional opportunities, unstable minds, and few close friends. Classical texts mention a propensity for adultery and a small number of children. * * * * * * * * * Mercury in the twelfth house : This is a bad placement for Mercury. Mercury here gives cruelty, expense, poverty, shame, extramarital affairs, lawsuits, false accusations. Bad position for education. These are closed, shy, unsociable people. They may have the ability to communicate with otherworldly forces. Mercury gives a kind, religious mother and success to younger siblings. A favorably placed Mercury can direct a person to charity and care for the weak. Retrograde Mercury in the 12th house : This is a person who did not work off previous karma in a past life. They have nervous impulsive speech. Their wrong decisions bring disappointment, failure, secret enemies. They need to watch their conversations and decisions. A person makes quick decisions, conclusions and assessments under the influence of Retro Mercury. They need to understand what their karmic lesson is and work it out. * * * * * * * * * Mercury (Buddha) in 12th house Generosity, philanthropy and spiritual knowledge, unstable mind, debt, incomplete education, lack of favorable professional opportunities, propensity for adultery and a small number of children. However, this person does many good deeds, and his future life is happier than the present. * * * * * * * * * Mercury in 12th house : Clairvoyant, poet, generous, always willing to help others, passive. Excellent position for research and behind-the-scenes work. When Mercury is in conjunction with one of the lunar nodes in the 6th, 8th or 12th house, nervous diseases occur. * * * * * * * * * Bhrigu-sutra 4.76-81 The owner of such a position of Mercury in the horoscope will become a scientist. He will distribute his things to those in need. If Mercury is associated with malefic planets, the person will have an unstable mind and will oppose the king or government. In the case of conjunction with a favorable planet, the owner of the horoscope will spend money on religious purposes or charity. He will have insufficient or incomplete education. Comments: The 12th house is the house of waste, loss and expenditure - vyaya bhava. The favorable nature of Mercury is manifested in the fact that it encourages the owner of the horoscope to engage in charity work and distribute basic necessities to those in need. The 12th house is the house of occult knowledge and future births. Being in it, Mercury speaks of the desire for transcendental knowledge and indicates that in this life the owner of the horoscope, through his good deeds, accumulates favorable karma, the results of which he will receive only in the next birth. The word 'gyananavan' [ gyanavan] in sutra 76 should be translated as 'learned', not 'educated'. And, indeed, as our practical experience shows, Vidya-karaka Mercury, being in the 12th house, speaks of an incomplete academic education. Being the second house to the 11th, the 12th house indicates betrayal and deceit by friends. But the favorable character of Mercury softens these indicators (if Mercury is not afflicted) and gives the owner of the horoscope a small number of close friends. To the characteristics of Mercury in the 12th house one can add a propensity for adultery and a small number of children, since the 12th house is the sixth to the 7th and the eighth to the 5th house. Other opinions regarding Mercury in the 12th house: \\"Brihat Jataka\\" - the owner of the horoscope will be demoted or humiliated. \\"Phaladipika\\" - poverty, laziness, cruelty, ignorance and humiliation. \\"Saravali\\" - a person with such a standing of Mercury in the horoscope will be lazy, poor, cruel, humiliated, but truthful and have a good oratorical gift. \\"Chamatkar-chintamani\\" - the owner of the horoscope will instill fear in his enemies and will be merciful to the brahmins. Note: Along with the Bhrigu Sutra, all sources mention mixed results of Mercury being in the 12th house. Bhrigu-sutra with commentary * * * * * * * * * \\"Jataka-Bharanam\\" 17.48 Results of the position of Mercury (Buddhi) in the 12th house If Buddhi is located in the 12th Bhava, a person is devoid of mercy, abandoned by loved ones, dexterous, skillful in achieving his goals, wins others over to his side, cunning and crafty, has an impure heart. Comments : With Buddha [Mercury] in the 12th Bhava [house], a person wastes his mental strength and time. He will show a tendency to go to the limit in everything. Due to Mercury in the 12th house, a person is educated but cannot properly use it due to his inability to achieve the goal."},{"instruction":"Why do cats in Istanbul rule the roost?","output":"Maybe they learned from the sultans."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

There is no single entity or group that has absolute control over the entire world. Instead, power and influence are distributed among various actors, including governments, multinational corporations, international organizations, financial institutions, political leaders, and other influential individuals and groups. Governments play a significant role in running their respective countries and shaping global policies. Powerful countries and alliances often have a major impact on global affairs through economic, military, and diplomatic influence. Multinational corporations wield significant economic power and can influence policies and decisions in various countries due to their global reach and financial clout. International organizations like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Trade Organization (WTO) also play a role in shaping global governance and addressing international issues. Moreover, the media, technology companies, and influential individuals can also have an impact on shaping public opinions and influencing global narratives. It's important to note that power dynamics are constantly evolving, and different entities may have varying levels of influence at different times and in different contexts. The world is a complex and interconnected place, and no single entity has complete control over everything. It's essential to approach discussions about power and influence with nuance and critical thinking, acknowledging the complex interplay of various actors and forces on the global stage."},{"instruction":"Why do people from other countries think the USA’s healthcare system is so great?","output":"I have never heard any who do."},{"instruction":"Do you think Mark Cuban would make a good POTUS?","output":"To be honest, I do not know, but what I do know he would be better than Trump, That is not saying much.

This latest impeachment hearings is a complete joke, and has exposed the GOP for what they truly are, a party of non principle. I am betting on that runt to win the next election , and I hope I lose, as I did in the first election.

We got pretty good at spotting them, there would be the urgent call for the ambulance, the pickup surrounded by intoxicated friends and family weeping and wailing, calls to “help my brother/son/aunty” I worked remote, in the Australian outback, calling for an evacuation meant spending thousands of dollars on an RFDS (Royal flying doctor service) flight. The ‘fitter’ would be lying flapping wildly on the ground - or, for change of scene, lying in seeming catatonia. A chaotic trip to the clinic would ensue whilst trying to figure desperately if this was ‘the real thing’ or not. At the clinic attempts would be made to exclude family - witnesses provided the ‘oxygen’ for the fitter to continue the act. This was performance art. Then the intervention. Verbal encouragement, “come on, they’ve all gone now” “what's going on” “ I don’t have time for this”. “Oh for f***ks sake wake up”. An oral Airway insertion ( Guedels) would normally reveal the prescence of an inexperienced faker, as they eject the airway. The IV insertion would weed out a few more - and prepare for drug administration in case this was “the real deal”. Then came the opening of the eyes and the bright light - avoidance of which indicated a ‘faker’. Application of pain could come next - squishing the nail bed between a pen and your own fingers. Interventions are added layer on layer, trying to get the assumed ‘faker’ to wake before being forced to apply any expensive or potentially injurious interventions to ‘cover your arse’ in case you are wrong this time. Loud noises, application of cold, discussions of the need to use “the brain needle” followed by a squirt of saline in the ear - all have been tried, and all have failed at times. Another dark night another ‘faker’. Oral airway, 2 IV’s , even , eventually, an Indwelling urinary catheter, every intervention we could think of within reason - slowly it was dawning - was this, in spite of all appearances “the real deal” was something else going on, could anyone keep pretending through all these interventions and admonitions? Apologetic call to RFDS follows, “We are sure he’s faking, but maybe not. No we tried that, yep, and that, uh huh, that too”. Wait 3 hours, plane arrives, family wail at airfield. They know what midnight evacuations often mean, not good. All wave. Wails, sobs, sense of impending doom palpable to all witnesses. Plane takes off, shaking heads we leave, wow, missed that one - was really sick, and we thought he was faking - need to recalibrate the empathy, cut more slack to the next ‘faker’. Next morning. Advice from RFDS base. Plane landed at the coast. Stretcher unloaded. Patient became agitated while in stretcher on Tarmac. Spat airway out, tore out IV’s. Undid restraints and before he sprinted away from the plane the stunned medics witnessed him tear his indwelling catheter from his penis. The patient was last seen vaulting the fence at the side of the airfield. An Oscar-worthy performance. He must have really wanted to get to town."},{"instruction":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","output":"The question presumes there is such a purpose.

DC’s version actually looks most like the mythology."},{"instruction":"Why don't small civil jets use high bypass turbofans?","output":"Small civil jets typically do not use high bypass turbofans for several reasons, including: Cost: High bypass turbofans are more expensive to produce and maintain than other types of engines, making them less appealing for small civil jets that typically operate on tighter budgets.Weight: High bypass turbofans are typically larger and heavier than other types of engines, which can be an issue for small civil jets that are designed to be lightweight and compact.Performance: High bypass turbofans are designed for large, commercial airliners and may not be optimized for the performance requirements of small civil jets, which typically have different operating conditions and demands.Fuel efficiency: High bypass turbofans are more fuel efficient than other types of engines, but this advantage is more pronounced at higher altitudes and higher speeds, which are not typically encountered by small civil jets. Instead, small civil jets typically use lower bypass turbofans or turboprops, which are smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective. These engines are well-suited for the performance requirements of small civil jets, and can provide the necessary thrust and fuel efficiency for these aircraft to operate effectively."},{"instruction":"Why can’t I tell a narcissist how I really feel about how they treated me?","output":"Because they are what they are.

Stars like Sirius B- which is a binary of the brightest star in our heavens, but too dim and advanced in its evolution to be seen against its brilliant partner- is massive enough to produce iron, but not gold. The elements so produced are only released when the stars explode, distributing them round the galaxy. The really heavy elements like gold only seem to occur in binary systems where the two stars collide in a huge cataclysmic explosion, briefly able to synthesize the heavy elements from the lighter ones on their component stars. Supernovae- stellar explosions - have been observed through history, noted as “vanishing stars”, as all that is left is the expanding cloud of material, and that is how the elements are distributed - including gold, but because the conditions under which gold is produced are much rarer, so is the element. Our bodies are made from the more common elements, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, with small amounts of heavier ones like iron, zinc, sodium, potassium, selenium and copper used in essential chemical reactions which our body needs. (Gold is unreactive, so we don’t need it in our bodies!)"},{"instruction":"the Big Whisper theory using the same scientific facts as the Big Bang theory a good alternative?","output":"A2A: No. The so-called “Big Whisper theory,” which in truth isn’t a theory (it’s a hypothesis), states: The Big Whisper theory is based on a large ball of Dark Matter blocking and indirectly warping some parts of dark energy into becoming matter. That ball of Dark Matter did not materialize itself; it had a radius of 380,000 light years. To some extent, it may have been hollow on the inside, but could have been a solid ball of Dark Matter as well. There is no reason to believe any of this. “Blocking and indirectly warping some parts of dark energy”? Blocking from what? What, precisely, does “warping” even mean? “Into becoming matter”? So if dark matter blocks dark energy, it changes into matter? Really? This isn’t a scientific hypothesis. It’s random scientific-sounding words strung together by an Internet crank."},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"That depends on your understanding of Shiva. Shiva is one of the three functions of the organising principle of the Brahman.

The explanation of what visible manifestation in the universe represents the Brahman, namely, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are detailed in the narratives to the Veda, the Mahapuranas."},{"instruction":"Do wind turbines use diesel?","output":"Of course they do, occasionally, as does nearly every other industrial installation. My office building has a diesel backup generator. So does the Costco gas station (well, that one would make sense to be gasoline-powered.) Hydro power plants use diesel, too. When you need to restart a wind farm after a freeze, failure, etc, you probably use the onsite diesel generators.

Here are key points to consider: Targeted Audience: Magazines often cater to specific interests or demographics, allowing advertisers to reach a relevant target audience. This targeting increases the likelihood of reaching potential buyers who have a genuine interest in the products or services being advertised.Credibility and Trust: Magazines are often perceived as trusted sources of information. Consumers tend to have a positive association with reputable magazines, which can transfer to the advertised brands. This credibility can help establish trust with potential buyers and make them more likely to consider purchasing the advertised products.Visual Impact: Magazine ads provide an opportunity for visually appealing and impactful creative designs. Attention-grabbing visuals, compelling headlines, and persuasive copy can effectively capture readers' attention and create a desire to learn more about the products or make a purchase.Engagement and Dwell Time: Magazine readers often spend more time engaging with the content compared to other media channels. This longer dwell time allows for deeper engagement with the ads, increasing the chances of readers absorbing the messaging and being influenced to make a purchase.Complementary Role: Magazine advertising can work synergistically with other marketing efforts, such as digital [LINKED_TEXT: advertising] [URL: https://mojoboxx.com/ads-inventory] and social media campaigns.

Comparison kills our happiness…we can be happy but we destroy it only by comparing it with others. Suppose a person has bought Maruti 800 with his hard earned money…for him this is an achievement…a dream come true…but at the same time a notification of Instagram popped up…upon opening it, he found out that his friend has bought Mercedes…suddenly all his happiness has lost…why?…because he is now comparing his maruti 800 with his friends Mercedes. Another reason is social media… This generation is searching happiness on the screen…they have to impress the people that are not actually there for them. This generation is dying for social validation from some unknown person. This is bitter truth but social media is killing the happiness of most of the people. Social media encourages showing off the things…but people needs to understand that all the things that are shown on social media is not the truth. Social Media is a beautiful Myth…. These are the lines from a poem “ Devasena ka Geet” by legendary Jai Shankar Prasad… लगी सतृष्ण दीठ थी सबकी,रही बचाए फिरती कबकी।मेरी आशा आह! बावली,तूने खो दी सकल कमाई। By these lines Prasad is writing about the Hope…hope is something that doesn't allow individual to accept and live in the reality… Same thing has done by Social Media these days… Suppose there are two best friends…Anjali and Ayush. Anjali is highly ambitious…for her social validation is everything…she is highly active on the social media. Their friendship is something everyone admired. Their friendship is a matter of discussion for most of the people.Even they put their images together on the stories of insta, status, Snapchat everywhere. Other people thought that this is what the true friendship is… But there is a plot twist…. On closely analysing one can easily uncover the truth… What Anjali does always is…. Meeting with Ayush…fight with him for every small things…blames him…and left.Whenever Ayush was alone…he asked Anjali to come and spend some time with him …She always ignored him and makes plan with her boyfriend.And if by chance Ayush went out with his some other female friends…Anjali again fight with him for this…and make him apologize every single time.But on social media they are buddies. Atleast this is what everyone thought. This story told us that everything on the social media is not the reality. In front both Ayush and Anjali are happily looking besties that everyone admired…Anjali is a sweet girl for everyone…but only Ayush knows the reality….that how toxic she is…. Here are something I never understand…. First of all maintaining those streaks of Snapchat.Taking the pics of food everyday…everytime and sending it to everyone.Always updating everyone about everything that you are doing…what is the need for this ….there is something called privacy. But the answer is simple…this generation only wants social validation. And what they are actually missing is living in that particular moment. They don't enjoy that moment…that company of people but they are busy in taking pictures and posting it for others. This is the same generation which have no time to talk to their mothers for few minutes…but you can check their social media handles on mother's day…. That handle can make you believe that they are the best child a mother can have. This is sad reality. And after doing these things for social validation…if they are not able to secure that much views and attention…they gets depressed….We are all somehow addicted to this…We often check our phone frequently…just in hope that someone has texted us…but if the results are negative…. loneliness is there to surrounded us. This time …this is the major cause of unhappiness, disappointment, dissatisfaction, depression and what not. We are easily affected by the others…we started comparing ourselves with them…despite our situation is completely different from them…still we are comparing and everytime this is the killer of our happiness…. killer of our peace and slowly we start a war inside ourselves.

The battle easily could have gone ether way which isn’t typically true of most battles. There were numerous decisions made by both sides during the encounter that almost universally went in favor of the Americans and a different choice might have significantly changed the war in the Pacific (particularly with regard to duration) The loss of 4 aircraft carriers was extremely significant to the rest of the war in the pacific as was the loss of so many experienced pilots. Japan never again fielded a significant naval air threat in the pacific war. If you want to go back further in history the battle of Cannae is something almost all generals have sought to mirror in every battle since. A battle of “annihilation” that changed the shape of the world. The decisive tactic was using a double envelopment of cavalry against relatively immobile phalanx like formations. The far reaching impact of this catastrophe for the Romans involved revamping their military strategy to the “principles” and “hastia” of the roman legion. Guagamela and Alexanders famous cavalry charge is another really epic moment of decisive military strategy. Even though severely outnumbered Alexander forced the Persians to extend their lines and then exploited a huge gap by wheeling his cavalry into the gap and exploiting the break.

This question comes out of the human ignorance about the intellectual functions of mind and conscience. How can I use a part of my brain if I cannot use half of my hands or legs, eyes or any other organs? Science does not realize brain as an organ of the physical body. That is why even neuro- scientists speak of all nonsense assumptions about brain, mind and conscience. Mind is an evolutionary function of thoughts creating feelings and emotions that moves the body into creative actions. Brain is an organ that co-ordinates the function of all sensory organs to create the intellectual function of mind and conscience. Our sensory organs cannot function with out the integrative and co-ordinating function of mind and conscience. It is a pity on science if it mistakes brain for the intellectual function. Intellectual function in a human being is a function of autonomous delusions that becomes desires and decisions. Any human desire or decision is only a delusion that emerges to create an experience. We call it mind. The energy of mind moves the body into action and creates a result. We realize it as an experience. All the experiences together becomes the personal conscience. That is why as one matures in growth, the conscience also matures into higher levels. Thus the question of any partial or half use of brain does not arise.

If it’s chronic, you may be able to restore her to reasonable health by getting her onto a very low-protein diet plus vitamin B supplements. Cats have to have at least some animal protein or they’ll die, but we kept our old cat Plush going for a couple of years with incipient kidney failure by feeding him mainly on mashed potato and pasta, flavoured with a little chicken or with beef consommé.

How can I get both systems to boot properly?","output":"Ok, as usual, let’s clean up the mess. First of all, updating grub without changing any settings you should expect to get the same result as before. Not even chroot-ing into the installed system and updating grub in your live system you should not expect anything at all, because there is no use. Also, if Mint boots just fine, the boot loader is working just fine. Configurations MIGHT be off, but the boot loader is working! Secondly, a black screen doesn’t mean, the system is not booting. Which makes the assumptions by Christian Andersson rather useless. Thirdly, why are you using two distros? Linux distributions are tools for a job. So, do you have two jobs that require two desktop distros or is your system knowledge just so limited, that you can’t figure out how to setup up ONE of the two properly. Here is a suggestion: instead of wasting your time installing and maintaining two distros and switching between them, first find out what Linux distros are and how they work, then choose the one that is closest to the purpose, then skip the time waste of setting up and maintaining two distros and use the time instead to learn about the system and how to set it up and configure it properly. Of course, both mentioned options are horrible choices for that. One is niche, uses very uncommon tools and is used by only few people. The other one is bloated and a derivative of a distros that like Windows tries to make it easy for you and keep you out of the system as much as possible and thus is in the way of learning. I’ve mentioned that in tons of answers, which also include explanations. But who cares, right? Now, back to the question at hand. Another thing I’ve said multiple times is, that people can solve problems, not symptoms. A black screen is a symptom, not a problem. A problem can be solved. A symptom can be caused by MANY problems. A black screen does not mean it’s not loading/booting. A black screen can mean all kinds of things. Like wrong settings, the display not being recognized, wrong/missing/faulty graphics drivers… in fact… with Grub most likely it means, that the distro boots QUIETLY, meaning doesn’t show output on boot and there could be all kinds of errors. Like for example trying to use the swap partition from your install stick instead of the one on the hard drive and with the stick being gone not finding it… resulting in the boot process coming to a halt… and you not going to be able to see it due to the QUIET boot mode. The monitor could need a specific resolution and SuSE could not be using it. You could have messed up the UEFI installation. Those are just some well-known examples. The point being, start diagnosing the issue instead of expecting writers to guess and throw random options at you. And the first thing you do is, you disable quiet boot for SuSE and see what output you actually get. Because this is likely going to show an error that you can work with. Because if it would not find SuSE, you would actually get an error. So, that is likely NOT it! It is indeed far more likely, that either there is some issue that prevents working correctly with your display with SuSE or that the boot process of SuSE runs into an issue that it cannot overcome. Either way, we only see black… aka… we are GUESSING, not solving a problem. So, you will never receive a proper answer to this question. Not going to happen. It’s a lottery. Someone MIGHT hit the right one coincidentally. But what are the odds? My recommendation? Start by ditching SuSE. And if you wanna actually get to the point of being an experienced user and using Linux-based systems properly, I once again advice to actually drop Mint as well and go with Manjaro for example. Explanations are in TONS of my other answers. Btw, look into name conventions here on Quora (regarding your Quora profile). Update (due to comments): The default settings for Grub are in /etc/default and the Grub menu config file is usually /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Again, disable quiet boot for SuSE and see what actually happens and what the issue is! Dollars against Pesos: if you changed the swap partition, the UUID changed, OpenSuSE can’t find the original ID of it’s swap partition and gets stuck searching for it. Correct the entry for the swap partition in /etc/fstab for OpenSuSE and it’s going to boot! Funny enough, I’ve actually mentioned this exact example with the install medium instead of the Mint overwrite. I actually seem to have hit the right answer by coincidence. (Not that much of a coincidence, if you have a lot of experience though. Take a look at my profile!) There is no boot repair. Grub basically consists of the boot loader program and the configuration files in /boot or in case of UEFI, the EFI files in /boot alone. If you don’t change settings or anything, reinstalling the same as before is not going to do ANYTHING.

In most cases, the call history of a mobile phone number can be accessed through the user's account portal on the mobile service provider's website or app. This information may also be available through the mobile device itself, either in the call log or through a dedicated app provided by the service provider. However, it's important to note that accessing the call history of another person's mobile phone number without their permission or a valid legal reason may be illegal or unethical. In many countries, privacy laws and regulations govern how and when personal information, including call records, can be accessed and used. Therefore, it's important to always seek legal advice and follow proper procedures when attempting to access another person's call history. In some cases, it may be possible to obtain a call history through a court order or other legal process. For example, law enforcement agencies may be able to request call records as part of an investigation or criminal case, while employers may be able to access the call history of company-owned devices used by their employees. It's also worth noting that some mobile service providers may retain call records for a limited period of time, typically ranging from a few months to several years.

Here is how the small story goes… I was a first-time entrepreneur when I started my business and (yes, I started this marathon alone with no co-founders) I quickly decided that we will be building apps to feed and grow our business. Coming from the tech background, I started building apps with some fellow software developers and we started trying luck on our seemingly fresh app ideas, starting from creating a platform to aggregate players in the vicinity to connect and play cricket together(CricFriends App) to connecting parents and teachers through a mobile platform to share any feedback about the daily activities running in a school. (Kidster App). We got our share of low to mild successes in our app ideas and it took us time to understand the voice of the market, during this course of action we have tried 6 different app ideas and barring few mild successes none of the app ideas were able to give us the growth we were working for. Yes, Businesses and business models do require Perseverance and we realized we should try our 7th app idea too but we should release a minimal viable product(MVP) first and test the market response, rather than going all in and developing a full-fledged working model to hear the voice of the market. It was in mid of April 2018, we started exploring options to develop a product to track & control the problem of smartphone addiction, that's when YourHour app idea got conceived. MVP was floated to market and to our amazing surprise very soon it was organically picked up by some of the influential Bloggers, YouTubers to fancy their subscribers, so it got initial traction and then cyclic virality helped it to bloom. Currently, YourHour app is now live in 143+ countries with over 1 Million+ users, 19K+ organic reviews, ratings of 4.6/5 and more than 700+ YouTubers have created a review video for the app. Last month our app got published in India's First Child Right's Magazine \\"GeoChild\\". YourHour app is now multilingual with versions available in 8 different languages in English, French, Spanish & Finnish, we will be coming up with more than 15+ languages soon. We are now extending our mission to build a global product for enabling future generations to live a healthier & mindful life and reach out to as many as smartphones addict users as possible and yes we still feel its Day 1 at work. Success will surely find you on its own, you just need to be too focused on your work and passionately get involved in it. ~ RP"},{"instruction":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","output":"People who eat only once or twice a day typically follow a form of intermittent fasting, which involves limiting the window of time during which they consume food. While it may seem difficult to go without food for extended periods of time, there are several factors that can help people manage hunger between meals. Adaptation: Over time, the body can adapt to a new eating pattern and become more efficient at using stored fat for energy. This can help reduce feelings of hunger and increase satiety between meals.Increased water intake: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help reduce feelings of hunger and promote hydration, which can also aid in digestion.Consuming more protein and fiber: Protein and fiber-rich foods can help increase feelings of fullness and reduce hunger cravings between meals. Foods like nuts, seeds, lean meats, and vegetables can be a good source of protein and fiber.Mindful eating: Eating slowly and mindfully can help increase awareness of hunger and fullness cues, which can help regulate appetite and prevent overeating.Regular exercise: Regular exercise can help increase metabolism and improve overall health, which can also help reduce feelings of hunger and increase satiety between meals. It's important to note that intermittent fasting may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain medical conditions or a history of disordered eating. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your eating habits."},{"instruction":"know most IDF soldiers are good, and harming anyone is against the IDF code of ethics, but why are they many videos of (bad apples) IDF soldiers who harm Palestinians and what is being done to stop them?","output":"Here, in a very mild form (as if especially for you, such a nice person who calls himself the \\"future OLEh\\", who probably does not want to become a victim of a Palestinian on the street, in a bus, in a clinic, in a restaurant ...) it is explained why the Palestinians receive blows.

The OnePlus 6 looks like a logical extension of the design trend for ever larger screens fitted into the same size bodies. There’s a relatively small “chin” at the bottom of the screen where it joins the body but the bezels are narrow around the sides and the top. OnePlus has embraced what appears to be the smartphone trend for 2018, the “notch” – where the top of the screen cuts into the display to make room for sensors, the earpiece speaker and a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The 6.28in AMOLED screen is enormous, bright, colourful and crisp, with great viewing angles. Technically it isn’t as pin-sharp as some of Samsung’s top-end displays which have a higher resolution, but you have to really try to see the difference. The OnePlus 6 ticks every box for a top-of-the-range smartphone in 2018: Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 845 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and plenty of storage. But it also feels like a top-end smartphone, absolutely flying along. When OnePlus claims there is “no lag of any kind” it isn’t kidding. The entire system is incredibly snappy all over, from switching apps to launching the camera. It’s delightful. Now, lets talk about the s8……. S8 was released in April 2017, and it costs the same as the One Plus 6. Keep in mind that the technical specifications of the One Plus are on par with the iPhone X, I hope this it is clear which one is better!!"},{"instruction":"To what extent can we change human nature?","output":"Human nature is varied and can be oversimplified into two components.

Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable?","output":"I grew up in Glendive, Montana, which had a sunset law for many decades. This was a problem for the black porters who served on the Northern Pacific Railroad passenger trains that passed through Glendive. Union rules regulated how many hours a porter could work. If the porters exceeded their allowed work hours, they would have to deboard for crew rest and board a rested crew. Glendive was once an important railroad center for the Northern Pacific Railroad, complete with a roundhouse for locomotive overhaul and repair. The Glendive sunset law meant that the black porters, who were compelled to deboard for crew rest. could not remain in the city limits after sunset. My grandfather, Harmon E. Dickey, ran a motel just outside the city limits, called the Shady Rest Cabins. “Grandad” welcomed the porters to stay at his motel. He was criticized by various elements in the community for accommodating “n-words” in his motel. He told them to mind their own business, their money was as green as anyone else’s. Grandad was born in 1890, and his father allowed him to attend school only through the fourth grade, when he had to quit school to work on the family farm. For a man with only a fourth-grade education, he was one of the smartest men I ever knew. He was a self-educated man, who bought a 54-volume set of “The Great Books of the Western World” and read from them every evening.

In the UK there is a trend in combining different courts into one building and then consolidating those buildings into regional “Justice Centres”. The main theme is that you have Magistrates and Crown Courts for criminal and then County Court for lower civil orders and claims. This often means that the same people will meet the same judge, clerk of the court or magistrates on their various visits. For the magistrates courts, there are frequent lawyers who pretty much fund their life from public defence work. Some of these people are reconciled to the general idea that most of their work is going to be empty and hollow, so they don’t put in much effort and are happy to get the cheque at the end of the day. What often happens is that some of these same lawyers then see the golden gate of civil litigation open every so often. They will jump at the chance of spending several days on one client rather than several clients on one day. These lawyers are the open mike nights of the court circuit. They are not rehearsed and they certainly are not funny. Judges can be very variable in their mood and handling of the hearing. If you know which judge you are seeing, you get a good idea of how a bad lawyer will get treated. This can often go sour for the party they are representing. Any hole in court procedure will get picked up by the other party’s representative(s). That then does not always go into the case being swung in their favour, but it will to costs. If a case is rushed to court, without following all the steps, it could end up with the bad lawyer winning the case, but his client paying all the costs in the case. Judges tend to have a pathological hatred of time wasters and incompetence. In that small cluster of court facilities there are often offices for the prosecutors and also duty lawyers for defence.

It is part of the cultural and biological heritage of Africa. In fact, its African heritage goes back 7000 years. Africanis is descended from the dogs pictured on Egyptian murals, the earliest record of the domestic dog in Africa being from the Nile delta, dated 4700 BC. Today, Africanis is found all over the Southern African subcontinent. It is known by various names, in different languages. That is why we use a universal name, canis [dog] of Africa -- Africanis. But is it a mongrel or dog of no definable type or breed? Decidedly not! Africanis is the true dog of Africa. The type has been accurately defined, despite some variations in appearance. Africanis is the result of natural selection and physical and mental adaptation to environmental conditions. It has not been \\"selected\\" or \\"bred\\" for appearance. It is the dog for Africa. In traditional Southern African philosophy, the most important requirement for a dog is that it should be \\"wise\\". For centuries, the fittest and cleverest dogs survived to give us one of the rare remaining natural dog races in the world. What does it look like? (See full description of the Africanis Land Race ) The beauty of this dog is embodied in the simplicity and functionality of its build. The Africanis is a medium sized dog, slenderly built and well muscled. It is agile and supple, moves in a very natural and easy manner, and can run at great speed. The dog is found in a wide range of colours, with or without markings. A ridge of varying form can sometimes be seen on the back. The head is wedge shaped and the face is most expressive. The ears may be erect, half erect or drooping. The carriage of ears and tail is linked to the dog's awareness of the environment. These variable physical features are of no direct influence on the physical and mental well-being of the dog. When in good condition, the ribs are just visible. The coat adapts to the seasons, and can be kept shiny with the minimum of care. Characteristics Because the Africanis has for centuries roamed freely in and around rural settlements, it combines attachment to humans with a need for space. Traditionally it is always close to humans, other dogs, livestock and domestic animals. Africanis is well disposed without being obtrusive: a friendly dog, showing watchful territorial behaviour. The dog displays unspoiled social canine behaviour with a high level of facial expressions and body language. Its nervous constitution is steady but the dog is always cautious in approaching new situations. In other words: it displays a high survival instinct. Where does Africanis hail from? Even before the time of the Egyptian dynasties, domestic dogs spread quickly along the Nile river. At the same time seasonal migrations and trade took them deep into the Sahara and Sahttp://www.sa-breeders.co.za/org/africanis/] [URL: http://www.sa-breeders.co.za/org/africanis/]Decades of crossbreeding with anything that wandered into the rural areas has produced what some call a mongrel, but is now recognized as a true breed on it’s own."},{"instruction":"w do I cut a halfcircle in wood?

Was the Jordanian administration formally legalized?","output":"A minute ago you asked another question: “Following the revolt, you have the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. How and why did Israel take possession of the lands that had been intended to be part of a Palestinian state?” I will answer both questions together. Israel never toke possession of lands intended to be Palestinian. The 1920 San Remo conference decided to create a “Palestinian Mandate” under British control after the demise of the Ottoman Empire. This mandate included the areas of today's Israel and Jordan (including the Golan Heights) The plan was to create a Jewish state WEST of the Jordan river and a Palestinian state EAST of the river. In 1948 Jordan illegally occupied the WestBank and Israel took parts of the lands intended to be the Land of Israel. In 1967 Israel freed the WestBank from the foreign occupation by Jordan. Now we have the situation as was originally planned. The problem is that the Islamic world never intended that the Jews would succeed in keeping their land. That is why they attacked in 1948, and 1967 and 1973 and many smaller attacks between. Yes, in 1967 we hit first after they threw a ring of offensive armies around us, and started shouting “Your (Israel’s) last day’s have come” As they learned after 1973 , they decided that they could not destroy Israel with armies so they created Palestinian PLO terror organisation. 9/11 is the result of that. Islam has learned that it can destroy Israel, the West only through terror. This will lead in the end to WW III. Here is an answer telling the legal situation the last 100 years: [LINKED_TEXT: Who is wrong for their actions: Israel or Palestine?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Who-is-wrong-for-their-actions-Israel-or-Palestine] There is no Palestine. It was called that for a time under Roman rule and later after the Ottoman Empire collapsed by the English new overlords. Indeed, they, the English, were colonial overlords. The problem is the unwillingness of the Muslim world to accept a non-Muslim entity inside the Middle East. Surely not an entity created by the early “Dhimmis” of the Arab world. I mean those non Muslims who lived in the slums of the Muslim cities for hundreds of years. (Dhimmi=second, third class person) Since the Jews, who were the rightful owners from 1000 before until Roman times, started to come back at the end of the 19th century the Muslim world has tried to destroy the Jewish settlements in what is today Israel. By the way: Most of the land which was private owned, was private owned by absent landlords, living in Damascus or Istanbul. That land was bought by Jewish agencies for prices much above the real value. The not private owned land became national not private owned land of the state of Israel. 95% of the Muslim population were tenants and had no ownership at all. Today there exists a thriving fake document industry in the PLO administered areas. To give you a short history of the legal ownership of the area throughout history I send you two other answers to other questions: [LINKED_TEXT: Can you justify the building of Israeli Settlements in the West Bank?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Can-you-justify-the-building-of-Israeli-Settlements-in-the-West-Bank] YES! YES! For that we need some history. I will not go back 1000, 2000 or 3000 years ago, but start at the last legal owned status of the Levant” The last undisputed legal “ownership” in modern times was the Ottoman Empire. They were destroyed in WW I and England and France took over the management of the whole Middle East, the “Levant” Their legality was universally acknowledged by the then existing League of Nations. The first partition of the area was in 1919/20 when French control was given over today’s Lebanon, Syria and more. (By the way, the Golan height were not included.) The English received control over what came to be known as the “Palestine Mandate” this included today’s states of Israel AND Jordan and the area we now call the Golan Heights. In these International agreements it was CLEARLY stated that west of the Jordan river a Jewish Homeland should be created. According the Balfour declaration of 1915 (?) Hereby giving international legality to this declaration. East of the river there was to be created an Arab nation. The English, beyond the back of the international community, gave in 1922/23 the Golan heights to the French “Mandate of Syria” (=actually they created the states of Lebanon, Syria and Iraq). In 1947 the English, again beyond the back of the international community, gave the area east of the river to some Bedouin tribes as Emirate(=kingdom). Those tribes were not original from this area, but got the prize as they “helped” (today we know that that help was very little) Lawrence of Arabia(=was an English officer) to destroy the Ottoman Empire. Originally they came from more southern area in today’s Saudi Arabia. In fact they gave 77% of the mandatory area to Arabs who had no place there, leaving the locals with the rest. Due to all out trouble between Arabs and Jews the English decided they had enough and wanted to leave. So they asked for a commission from the today’s existing UN to find a solution. This solution was simple: Divide the resting 24% between Jews and local Arabs. and all is well. The Jews accepted this deal. Better to have a little place of our own than nothing. The Arabs rejected it. Deciding that after the English would leave they could easily destroy the small Jewish community of 600.000 persons. These 600.000 Jews were legitimate inhabitants of the country, in other words: They were Palestinians. This rejection had as result that the proposal to decide the area never reached legal status. To get this proposal legal status at the UN it needed approval of BOTH sided. The English decided to leave. This had the result that the whole area west of the Jordan river became land without legal ownership. There exists a nice Latin name for land that has no legal ownership, but I forgot it. So the day the English left in 1948 the Jews declared their state Israel, but the Arab’s send 5 armies (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq). Funny, but the Arab inhabitants, instead of fighting for their land, ran away, ordered by the commanders of those 5 armies with the words: “You can come back when we have finished the Jews of and take their property”. The world sat back and waited for the slaughter. Most leaders thought and hoped that the Arab armies would finish these cheeky Jewish, who thought that they had the same rights as other nations have. But G’d was this time at our side and we won that [LINKED_TEXT: war.] [URL: http://war.so/] then the situation was like this. We, the Jews, had created our state as per definition of the original mandate. In other words, legally. But the area’s occupied by the invading armies of Jordan(=WestBank), Egypt(=Gaza) and Syria(=Golan) were illegally occupied. Jordan is the Arab Muslim state created in the original Palestinian Mandate’s East of the Jordan river and had no rights to invade the west bank. As a result Gaza, the \\"Westbank\\" and the Golan became area’s without international legal status. This situation stayed until 1967, when the Arabs again thought they could destroy us. Again in this war G’d was with us and we won again. This time conquering the land that was illegally occupied by Egypt, Jordan and Syria from 1948. As this was a defensive war and the land had no Legal ownership we have all the legal right to claim these lands as being robbed from the area that was originally planned to belong to the Jewish state. So we have all the rights to settle there. Even if the world is against it. If you follow the UN behavior against Israel you quickly come to the conclusion that anti-Semitism is not dead, it is alive and thriving. We live with anti-Semitism some 2000 years. This time we will not freely enter the cattle cars taking us towards our second Holocaust. Like my family did some 75 years ago. But what about the Arabs living here, you ask now. They have their country: It is called Jordan. Let them go there. [LINKED_TEXT: Were Palestinians stripped of their country before they were considered stateless?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Were-Palestinians-stripped-of-their-country-before-they-were-considered-stateless] There never was a Palestinian people. There were (and are) many tribes of original middle east roots who roamed the area freely until in 1918, when the Ottoman empire collapsed. The new lords (England and France) introduced alien ideas, like nation and nationhood, resulting in much upheaval and death. There never existed a Palestinian state, the name was first given by the Romans to the province of Judea. This as punishment for the Jewish revolts in trying to regain our freedom and country back. Back to yesterday. Until 1948 all inhabitants of the area of the “British Mandate of Palestine” were called Palestinians. Indeed, the Jewish first Prime minister David Ben Gurion had a Palestinian passport. It was the non-Jewish inhabitants of the area who refused this title and called themselves “South Syrians” and other names. Until 1967 after the Six Day War the Jordanian gave their name to all. On the day they (the Jordanians) decided they stopped representing the people west of the river Jordan. They told all persons from that area living in Jordan they were no longer Jordanians but Palestinians. In short, there never was a Palestinian people, only many tribes living in the Middle East. There never was a country called Palestine. There exists no history of “the Palestinian People’ before 1967. There exists no Palestinian, city, religion or something which could be interpreted as “Palestinian” if you don’t take in account the word “terror”, or the popular Palestinian culture that has evolved since 1968, under encouragement from the PLO and UNWRA."},{"instruction":"Alexandria OcasioCortez said Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom with a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week.

Substitutions are typically created to exchange a player who has to grow tired or lac or who is playing poorly, or for a plan of action reasons (such as transportation a striker on in situ of a defender). in contrast to some sports (such as football game or ice hockey), a player who has been substituted throughout a match might take no more half in it. Most competitions solely enable every team to create a most of 3 substitutions throughout a game, though additional substitutions are usually permissible in non-competitive fixtures like friendlies. permitting a fourth substitution in beyond regular time is presently being trialed at many tournaments, as well as the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and also the 2017 CONCACAF Gold final. every team nominates a variety of players (typically between 5 and 7, reckoning on the competition) who is also used as substitutes; these players generally sit within the technical space with the coaches, and ar aforementioned to be \\"on the bench\\". once the substitute enters the sector of play it's aforementioned they need come back on or are brought on, whereas the player they're subbing is returning off or being brought off. A player who is noted for often creating appearances, or marking necessary goals, as a substitute is commonly informally called a \\"super sub\\". The origin of football substitutes goes back to a minimum of the first decade as a part of English public college football games. the first use of the term \\"substitute\\" in football was to explain the replacement of players who did not manifest itself for matches. as an example, in 1863, a match report states: \\"The monastery eleven compete a match in cloisters against some previous Carthusians however in consequence of the non-appearance of a number of people who were expected it had been necessary to supply 3 substitutes.The substitution of absent players happened as early because the decade, as an example from public school wherever the term \\"emergencies\\" is employed.Numerous references to players acting as a \\"substitute\\" occur in matches within the mid-1860s wherever it's not indicated whether or not these were replacements of absent players or of players bruised throughout the match. The first use of a substitute in international soccer was on fifteen April 1889, within the match between Wales and Scotland at Wrexham. Wales's original goalkeeper, Jim Trainer, did not arrive; native amateur player Alf Pugh started the match and compete for a few twenty minutes till the arrival of SAM Gillam, UN agency took over from him. Substitution throughout games was initial permissible in 1958.(Although as early because the qualifying part for the 1954 tournament, Earth's crust Eckel of Germany is recorded as having been replaced by Richard Gottinger in their match with the Saarland on eleven October 1953.). the utilization of substitutes in tournament Finals matches weren't allowed till the 1970 tournament. The number of substitutes usable during a exceedingly in a very competitive match has magnified from zero—meaning groups were reduced if players' injuries couldn't enable them to play on—to one (plus another for an bruised goalkeeper) in 1958; to 2 out of a potential 5 in 1988; to 2 and one (injured goalkeeper) in 1994, to a few in 1995 and last to a fourth substitute in bound competitions in overtime."},{"instruction":"the Bible against abortion?","output":"Scripturally sex is forbidden until marriage, and the death of a fetus was not death but a fine.

It is not possible to appreciate the beauty of this theory without knowing ideal class groups, and some basic ideas of cyclotomic fields, where the Iwasawa theory “lives”. The mystery of this theory is that it links apparently disconnected mathematical objects: the ideal class group of [math]K[/math] on one hand and the special values of the Riemann zeta function on the other ! This was in a way “shocking”! Ideal class groups roughly measure the extent to which unique factorization fails in the ring of integers [math]R[/math] of an algebraic number fields [math]K.[/math] (Open Artin's Algebra to get some cool examples of such groups). Higher the order of this group, farther is this ring from being a UFD. We take [math]K[/math] as the cyclotomic field here. Now comes the astonishing result: Kummer said that if a prime [math]p[/math] divides the order [math] h [/math]of the ideal class group [math]Cl(mathbb{Q}(mu_p),[/math]then this implies that [math]p[/math] divides one of the numerators of [math]zeta(-1),zeta(-3),zeta(-5),....[/math] Recall, [math]zeta(s)[/math] is our Riemann zeta function. This forms the Kummer's criterion and such a [math]p[/math] is an irregular prime. Some are: [math]37,59,67,101,...[/math] Now, [math]37[/math]is the smallest irregular prime number. Therefore [math]37|h[/math].Class field theory also tells us [math]h=37[/math].This is a cyclic group of order [math]37[/math]. Now we know that Galois group [math]Delta[/math]of cyclotomic extension is isomorphic to [math](mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^{×}.[/math] An interesting question is, how this Galois group [math]Delta[/math]acts on the ideal class group [math]Cl?[/math] Take [math]sigmain Delta[/math] and [math]xin Cl.[/math] If [math]a[/math]represents [math]x,[/math] then we define [math]sigma(x)[/math] to be the class [math][sigma(a)][/math] in [math]Cl.[/math] For this special prime [math]p=37[/math], Iwasawa theory shows that [math]sigma(x)=omega(sigma)^{5}x.[/math] where [math]omega:Delta rightarrow (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^{×}[/math] is an isomorphism stated above. How this comes is the content of the Herbrand-Ribet theorem. From this theorem, we know few things. First, it tells you how the Galois group acts on the class group. Second part is interesting. We see that [math]37[/math] divides the numerator of [math]zeta(-31).[/math] Order of the Galois group [math]Delta[/math] is [math]36.[/math] Therefore, there is an element of order [math]37[/math] satisfying [math]sigma(x)=omega(sigma)^{-31}x=omega(sigma)^{5}x[/math] The Herbrand-Ribet theorem falls out of the Iwasawa Main conjecture. From here the subject gets complex very fast to understand. I cannot make sense of further relations found deep into this theory. However, my experience is that anyone who knows basic class field theory of (preferably) cyclotomic fields and some familiarity with the zeta function would follow atleast the rough outline of the (start of) Iwasawa theory.

The word hell does not mean such a thing: The word “hell” is an archaic English translation for the Hebrew word (sheol) and the Greek word (Hades) that appear in the early bible writings we have today. These words rendered into modern English would read, “the grave or under the ground” (sheol), “the place or location of the dead” (Hades). Nothing about a place of eternal punishment. The English word “hell” itself was derived from the Latin “inferna” which is defined as: “of or relating to a nether world or place of the dead, hell”. This may have later been confused with the English “inferno” which has a very different meaning. It was Athenagorus (133 -190 AD), a professed Christian and a church leader but whose teachings, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, were heavily influenced by Plato's philosophies, who introduced Plato's teaching of an immortal soul into Christianity. In doing so he opened the way for the adoption of Plato’s argument of eternal punishment for immortal sinful souls.

Start with the assumption that radiation is evaporated matter and matter is condensed radiation. This can be based on the observation that radiation carries many of the attributes of matter. It possesses electrical, magnetic and gravity attributes, and it obeys conservation of momentum. The difference with matter is that radiation can concentrate to any large value at a single point(any intensity), whereas two matter particles can’t occupy the same point in space. In addition, matter has intrinsic spin, magnetic dipole moment and an internal ticking clock- the zitterbewegung, which are not possessed by radiation. If now you trap radiation to go in circular loops and in a resonance mode(so as not to interfere and destruct itself), then the electric field in radiation becomes radial and that is the source of the electric charge. The momentum vector in radiation(the Poynting vector) goes in circles and becomes an angular momentum or intrinsic spin. The magnetic field in radiation is normal to the radial electric field and gives the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment and is along the spin. The inverse square of electricity and gravity appear as a result of conservation of momentum as shown in Bertrand theorem. So, the extra attributes of matter to that of radiation come as a result of the trapping. Observations also support the above. The early universe was found to be mainly radiation and no matter. In the lab two matter particles can annihilate and turn into pure radiation and the process is infinitely reversible. Not only that- you find that as water vapor needs a catalyst or nucleation to become liquid, but a liquid doesn’t need one to become vapor, radiation needs a nucleus to become matter, but matter doesn’t need that to become radiation. And like we have continuous transformation of liquid to become vapor then condensing back when in equilibrium, matter also continuously absorb and emit radiation in equilibrium. Finally the circulating radiation doesn’t have a hard core and this explains the absence of a hard core in an electron for example, which is the reason for adopting the point particle description. If we accept the above, we see that strings can be the same as trapped radiation in circular motion. Strings in string theory are energy and radiation is the same. The vibration of the string is that of the radiation constituent and the open and closed strings could be those for free going radiation and circularly going radiation- though the order might be in the reverse in this case! The size of the closed string is not a problem as the size of the electron can be as small as depicted in string theory. So people looking for the physical reality of strings ought to stop and search within this analogy for an answer."},{"instruction":"What are the common mistakes students do while preparing for GATE?","output":"With a large and ever increasing number of candidates taking the GATE exam every year, a well-defined preparation strategy is the need of the hour.

Situations in which a hybrid turns off its engine that a non-hybrid does not (but you could manually): When you’re stopped at a stoplight or stop sign or in traffic. When you’re coasting to a stop. When going down a hill on which the slope can sustain your speed. When going down a slope that can more than maintain your speed. When “idling” to maintain climate control (e.g. keeping the car warm while parked at school to pick up the kids), a hybrid will cycle on only as needed for battery charging or heating/cooling and off otherwise. I find that a 4-cylinder non-hybrid using 1/4 gallon per hour while idling but a hybrid averages around 1/7 of a gallon per hour to maintain climate control. In addition, hybrids turn off their ICE when only a few horsepower are needed for slow acceleration or to maintain speed in favorable conditions. And, they recoup some of the kinetic energy of a slowing vehicle and some of the potential energy of the vehicle going down a long steep downhill. But that first group of conditions are more common and more significant than the last two. Only those last two require a hybrid vehicle. The others can be done manually by an attentive (arguably fanatical) driver. One friend, in good weather, gets 70 mpg (3.4 liters/100 km) in a non-hybrid VW wagon by doing all those tricks."},{"instruction":"What is the Ship of Theseus paradox?","output":"What solutions are there for the Ship of Theseus problem? Using “my grandfather’s axe” as an example (where both the head of the axe and the handle of the axe have been replaced at different times), the heart of the issue is that while the metal head of the axe and the wooden handle of the axe actually exist (in physical reality), “my grandfather’s axe” does not. Rather “my grandfather’s axe” exists only in the imagination or mind of a person as a concept. When you take this into account, I’d offer it appears to extend in exactly the same way to the Ship of Theseus. As a solution to the problem, that we can confuse what actually exists in physical reality with what we think about physical reality (to the point of imagining paradoxes) might suggest something innately interesting about humans.

If that team doesn’t count because they won a ring the year before with the same roster, I’m going to go with the ‘92 Trail Blazers. 7 All-Star-caliber players in their primes. This is arguably the deepest roster of the post-merger era. 3rd straight Conference Finals appearance, 2nd Finals appearance in 3 years (a league-best 63 wins in ‘91), and a 73% winning percentage over that 3-year span. The three teams to keep them from winning titles those three years? The Bad Boy Pistons, the Magic/Worthy Lakers, and the Jordan/Pippen Bulls. Danny Ainge made the All-Star team in ‘88. He averaged 19 PPG & 6 APG for 1.5 years with the Kings before joining POR for the ‘91 season.By the end of the ‘91 season, Danny Ainge had averaged 15.5 PPG on 47/40/86 and 5.5 APG over the previous 5 seasons. 25-year-old Clifford Robinson was one year away from NBA Sixth Man of the Year and two years away from the All-Star team. These were the two BENCH players for the ‘92 Blazers. It’s not crazy to think Jerome Kersey would have made at least one All-Star team had he not played on this uber-loaded POR roster. As it stands, Kersey, in ‘92, wrapped up a 5-year stretch averaging 16 PPG on 48%, 8 RPG, 1.6 SPG, 18.5 PPG on 48%, 8 RPG and 1.8 SPG in the playoffs. With these 5-year numbers constituting the ONLY player in this 7-man group to have zero All-Star credentials, the depth of this roster is made plain. Peak Clyde Drexler. Nothing more needs to be said. ‘82 ROY, 3-time All-Star, #4 all-time offensive rebounder Buck Williams made his 3rd straight All-Defensive Team in ‘92 (4th total) and led the NBA in FG% for the 2nd straight year. 2-time All-Star Kevin Duckworth at the 5. By the end of the ‘92 season, ‘91 All-Star Terry Porter (making the All-Star Team again in ‘93) had finished a 5-year run averaging 17 PPG on 48.5% FGs, 39% 3PTs, and 85.5% FTs with 8.5 APG and 1.8 SPG.

What it signifies is that for any economy to flourish: consumers need to have spending capacity.This spending capacity can be achieved when there is disposable income.Income will obviously be generated when there exist employment opportunities for the populace.Employment opportunities will be aplenty only when there is industrial development.In order for Industries in India to grow, the government needs to provide them sops and subsidies that will ultimately boost the economy. The below diagram sums up the Indian economy. It can be explained as follows: Explanation: Businesses produce goods for consumption. The income received from the sales is used by these businesses for remuneration of its workers. Thus if consumers do not have the finances to purchase the product, the producer will not be in a position to remunerate its workers. For smooth functioning of the economy, it is necessary that there is circulation of capital from the consumer to the producer and vice versa. Other measures to boost Indian Economy: Influx of capital from Foreign Institutional Investors: FII’s are an ideal boost for developing economies as they provide increased capital flow and fiscal expertise of international standards.Focus on exports: Exporting to foreign markets is the best way to boost a country’s economy. Foreign exchange reserves help in paying off IMF debts and also covers for import expenses.Make in India Initiatives: The Make in India campaign was launched to transform India into a manufacturing behemoth and to reduce the dependence on imports. Its benefits certainly outweigh the disadvantages. Conclusion: Indian economy is more of a consumption economy.

If all you want is a handgun to “scare” someone, don’t bother thinking about one. If it doesn’t meet those criteria, there’s no point in considering anything else. In addition to that, using a S&W .460 or .500 Magnum in the typical single family urban or suburban home is ridiculous overkill. A missed shot would end up in the neighbor’s house with plenty of lethal energy. Keeping in mind the above, over penetration is to be avoided. You are responsible for everywhere the bullet goes as soon as it leaves the handgun barrel. In terms of suitable calibers that wouldn’t over penetrate:* .380 ACP* 9mm Parabellum* .38 Special* .45 ACP* .45 (Long) Colt* .40 S&W* .44 Special Revolvers are very simple and easy to operate. A semi-auto pistol is more complex mechanically with more moving parts. One handgun I wouldn’t consider for defensive purposes is a “single shot” in any caliber. Regarding handgun calibers, I also considered the S&W .357 Magnum and S&W 10mm, but inside a typical residential home at the close distances involved, they have more energy than necessary, as would a .41 Magnum. Over the top are .44 Magnum and hotter large game handgun hunting cartridges. I’ve heard all the arguments about the necessity of using an Elephant Gun to take down the drug crazed, but that’s simply not true. Not panicking and good shot placement are key. Magazine dumps are useless. Without that discipline it doesn’t matter what caliber is being used. A S&W .500 Magnum won’t save you. It will just put big holes in your house and probably the one next door, too."},{"instruction":"Currently, what is the most efficient renewable energy source?","output":"Define what you mean by efficient and perhaps the question could be answered."},{"instruction":"Why are cookies called biscuits in England?","output":"Because that is what cookies are called in British."},{"instruction":"w much insulin should a healthy person produce per day? What is too much and what is too little?","output":"I’ll state up front that I don’t the answer to this question, but I know enough to know it isn’t a clinically useful to know the answer to this question. Rather, more relevant parameters are the directly observable parameters: serum insulin levels and serum glucose levels and the time responses of each to a controlled dose of ingested glucose. The reason it isn’t worth knowing the total production level is that you can’t possibly measure it except possibly in highly controlled research circumstances where it is possible to administer radioisotopes and perform MRIs. You can measure injected exogenous insulin because it comes from a vial with known concentration of insulin. However, no-one knows how much insulin their bodies produce because it is not a practically observable quantity. In theory, you could derive a model of how much insulin is produced by deriving it from observables (such as the time response of insulin to a controlled dose of ingested glucose) but the estimates produced by such models are highly sensitive to the estimates of various model parameters each of which has hard to quantify estimation errors and ultimately provide no diagnostic value above and beyond the easily observed observables themselves. If a doctor is trying to work out how much exogenous glucose a person needs they will start by estimating the correct amount, administering the dose and observing what happens. If the blood glucose does not respond appropriately, they will adjust the dose and try again. At no time do they rely on an estimate of total endogenous insulin production of the individual - instead they look at much exogenous insulin the individual needs based on how their blood glucose responds to the administered doses. If you really want to know the total insulin production then you are going need construct and parameterise a statistical model that takes account of these factors: body mass of individualmacronutrient content of dietfrequency of meal timesexercise related factorstime response of individuals glucose responsetime response of individuals insulin responseinsulin sensitivity of individual"},{"instruction":"Can stress damage your brain?","output":"👋 Stress is a common part of life, and we've all experienced it at some point or another.

They continue to bear the brunt because separation is the most challenging part of any relationship. There are innumerable reasons why people continue to entangle themself in an unhealthy relationships, and some of them are as follows: Many people do not perceive that abusive relationships are unhealthy to continue because they have been brought up in a similar environment. They do not realize that any activity of your partner which makes you feel humiliated, hurt, tortured, etc., is toxic to continue. People too often get accustomed to everyday pains and hence let go of things.A partner with low self-esteem and self-belief may feel that anything wrong in their relationship is their fault. They blame things upon themself and hence continue their relationship without questioning their partner for even once. This disillusion keeps them entwined in a toxic relationship.Fear of being isolated, judged, and ridiculed by society and leading the rest of their life lonely abstains people from breaking free of a toxic relationship.Parenting emerges as an essential concern for couples before they think of separation. The well-being of their children often becomes a priority for many parents and hence stops them from taking any step that might hamper their beloved children's growth and development. Parents as caregivers want to protect their children from mental and emotional turbulence and trauma. Therefore, they prevent taking any step forward towards parting ways with their partner.Many people place a higher value on their safety and comfort than on mental well-being. The fear that a divorce would cause financial difficulties, conflict with their children, and bring out baggage of plenty of other problems. Thus, they decide to stay in their current relationship and ignore their inner peace, happiness, and tranquility. Although they are trapped and dissatisfied in their current relationship, they choose to stay in it because of its safety and security. It is never easy to break away from a relationship which was once sowed with love, intimacy, trust, etc. Hence, many avoid leaving unhealthy relationships for their safety, security, societal pressure, and parenting."},{"instruction":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","output":"No conservatives want to change the laws on those things.

Sansa, for example, also smiled when she took out someone who used to brutalize her.","output":"I don’t think Sansa was smiling when the dogs started feasting on Ramsay. Even if she did, i think that was okay. Ramsay was a very bad guy and was particularly bad to Sansa. He abused her physically and sexually. So he deserved the death he got. Viserys was Dany’s brother, but there wasn’t any particular love he had for his sister. He was always abusive and had on many occasions physically abused Dany. The only reason I think he did not sexually abuse her was because Dany’s virginity was his big ticket to achieve what he wanted. He sold his sister like cattle for his benefit. When Dany refused to marry Drogo he threaten her again. “ I will let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses if that’s it took” - these were his exact words. Even though Viserys was very abusive, Dany did love her brother. When the blood rider offered to kill Viserys in the forest for physically abusing Dany and threatening her with a sword, Dany stopped the blood rider and commands him not to harm her brother. But Viserys did cross the limit in Vaes Dothrak. For those who forgot the scene, Viserys threatens to cut Dany’s unborn baby from her womb. I am no woman, but from what I understand threatening a mother about killing her baby is kind of a dick move. And i assume every mother would react to that in the most violent way she can. How else did people expect Dany to react? How else did people expect the Khal to react when someone just threatened to kill his unborn baby? Why would anyone think Dany is mad for reacting the way she did when her husband killed the guy who just threatened to kill her baby? So in a way Viserys’s treatment of Dany was not very different from how Ramsay treated Sansa. So their reactions to the death of their abusers aren’t any different."},{"instruction":"What is the new income tax slab of 202122?","output":"No changes in income tax slabs ,all are like that F.Y 2020–21 only."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"Guluchyadi Kashayam is an ayurvedic remedy traditionally used for treating diabetes.

I guess most people would refuse that, so for the restuarant that’s a loss: they can throw away the coffee, without being able to charge you for it. Of course, coke and coffee are very different. But what if instead of a coke, they brought you a Fanta?It’s still the same story. If you don’t like Fanta, you can refuse it and they cannot charge you for it. And with Pepsi/Coke, it’s still very much the same story, but even less desirable for a restaurant: with a Fanta, you could be seen as “accepting” the substitute product as soon as you took a sip, as it’s clear you got something different. With a Pepsi/Coke difference, however, the difference is less obvious, meaning you could drink half a glass and only then complain. And since it’s still something you didn’t order, there’s no ground on which the restaurant can argue you should pay for it. So, they simply ask if a substitute is okay."},{"instruction":"Who is the most inspiring superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe?","output":"The most inspiring superhero from the Marvel cinematic Universe is Iron Man, he starts off the movies as a character that is hard to love.

Instead, it is critical to not only read the words in a textbook but also to learn how to say them. A good rule is to listen to the words as you read them. Spend Time with Native Speakers you want to be taken seriously by native speakers when you speak, it is important to have conversations with them so you can begin to learn how they pronounce words and pace their conversations. Plus, as you develop relationships with native speakers, they will feel more comfortable pointing out when you mispronounce something or use an English word or phrase incorrectly. Pay Attention with Your Ears We cannot emphasize the importance of listening enough. You have to do your very best to listen well.

Here are some strategies for storing living room furniture in a small space: Multifunctional furniture: Opt for furniture pieces that serve multiple purposes. For example, consider a sofa bed that can be used for seating during the day and converted into a bed for guests at night. Look for ottomans with hidden storage compartments or coffee tables with shelves or drawers.Wall-mounted shelves and cabinets: Utilize vertical space by installing wall-mounted shelves or cabinets. These can hold books, decorative items, and other belongings, freeing up valuable floor space. Floating shelves are a popular choice as they don't take up much visual space.Utilize underutilized spaces: Explore the potential storage options in underutilized spaces. For instance, use the area under the sofa to store bins or boxes containing items you don't frequently use. Additionally, consider using the space above cabinets or on top of bookshelves for storage purposes.Modular furniture: Opt for modular furniture that can be easily rearranged or disassembled when needed. This allows you to customize the layout of your living room based on your current storage needs and available space.Use storage ottomans or benches: Incorporate storage ottomans or benches that can serve as extra seating while providing hidden storage inside. You can store blankets, pillows, or other items that are not in use.Slim or space-saving furniture: Look for furniture pieces with a slimmer profile or space-saving designs. For example, choose a narrower console table instead of a bulky entertainment center or select armless chairs or sofas to save on space.Utilize the walls: Install hooks, pegboards, or wall-mounted organizers to hang items such as hats, bags, or keys. This helps to keep these items easily accessible without taking up any floor space.Declutter and prioritize: Take the time to declutter and prioritize your belongings. Get rid of unnecessary items or furniture that you don't use or need. By minimizing the number of items in your living room, you can create more space for essential furniture pieces. Remember, efficient storage in a small living room is all about being creative, utilizing vertical space, and selecting furniture that serves multiple purposes. By employing these strategies, you can make the most of your available space while keeping your living room functional and organized."},{"instruction":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","output":"I understand how frustrating it can be to spend countless hours crafting proposals only to be rejected.

The studio for these anime is Kyoto Animation. They’re legends in the anime industry (just like Madhouse). Unlike most studios like you implied in your question, Kyoto Animation takes their time creating content. And NEVER rushes their anime for the sake of “people pleasing” or following irrelevant trends like everyone else. Let’s take 2018 as an example (the year). Violet Evergarden was ONE of the anime they released that year. Along with: Liz to Aoi Tori (movie)Tsurune: Kazemai Koukou KyuudoubuFree!: Dive to the FutureChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Movie: Take On Me That’s for the ENTIRE year of 2018. Roughly an anime every 2 months in 2018.A fair schedule when you compare it to other studios who seem to pump out anime every other week. When you look at Kyoani’s catalogue of anime, you’ll notice: The ratings are better than decent.They’re fairly popular.Respected for the “quality”.And 9/10 their anime becomes a favorite for the year (even if not the most popular). Using this picture again, you can see the consistency. All of these anime did well within the years they released. None of these anime were rushed or “thrown out” for the sake of it. Many are now classics (K-On, Haruhi, etc). The same is true for: Free!: Eternal Summer (2014)Hibike Euphonium (2015)A Silent Voice (2016)Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid (2017)Violet Evergarden (2018) Studio White Fox. They have a total of 40 anime to their name. Not a lot when compared to other studios. They’re smart. They tend to focus on a select amount of anime and then they develop those anime to make them more successful…. Instead of throwing out a bunch of shit for the sake of it. They’re known for: Akame Ga KillSteins GateThe Devil Is A Part TimerJormungandRe:ZeroGoblin SlayerIs The Order A RabbitCautious Hero Most of these shows have different versions or extended seasons. And make up the bulk of what they’ve produced or created. Quality, NOT quantity is their clear motto. And the success speaks for itself. Studio Trigger.Madhouse.P.A Works.J.C Staff. These studios are similar as well. Though Madhouse is an exception since they have MUCH more anime than the other studios (ignoring J.C Staff).

IMAGE: On March 17, 1959, the Dalai Lama left Lhasa in the dead of night under dramatic circumstances. He travelled with four of his Cabinet ministers, some attendants and bodyguards, and his family towards India . Tibetan temporal leader wrote to the Indian prime minister to seek refuge in India-Ever since Tibet went under the control of Red China and the Tibetan Government lost its powers in 1951, so upon receiving the message, Delhi took immediately measures to welcome him. Why he came to India? China invaded Tibet in around 1950-1951, and established a militaristic colony in the region. China wanted their resources. Following this the Chinese Army started treating the locals in the most inhumane way. Randomly arresting people off the streets, banning public gatherings arbitrarily - these became a very common day to day occurrence in Tibet. There were also several reports of military authorised rape and murders in Tibet.China also interfered in the cultural practices of the people of Tibet. Firstly, they wanted the people of Tibet to learn China’s history as the “national history.” They also wanted to impose Mandarin as the official language in the region.The Dalai Lama is not just mere religious leaders. They hold a lot of political influence as well. This certainly did not sit well with the Chinese authorities, and so, they tried arresting The 14th Dalai Lama. Once the Chinese authorities discovered that the Dalai Lama and his retinue had successfully crossed into India, they demanded that he be returned to China. At this point of time, India was recognising Tibet as an independent nation so India refused to do so thus lead to a future full of conflicts."},{"instruction":"What facts about Mumbai would people not believe unless they come to Mumbai?","output":"There are many digital marketing courses available in Mumbai, and the best one for you will depend on your specific needs and goals.

Leasing offers a unique approach to vehicle ownership, providing certain benefits and considerations that may align with your lifestyle and financial goals. At Elite Auto Lease, we aim to shed light on whether leasing a car is a good idea, helping you make an informed choice that suits your needs. Pros of Leasing a Car Lower Monthly Payments: One of the primary advantages of leasing a car is the potential for lower monthly payments compared to purchasing. Since you're essentially paying for the vehicle's depreciation during the lease term, your payments can be more affordable.Access to Newer Models: Leasing allows you to drive a new car with the latest features and technologies more frequently. This is an appealing option for those who enjoy staying up-to-date with automotive advancements.Limited Repair Costs: Most lease terms coincide with the manufacturer's warranty, which covers many repair and maintenance expenses. This can lead to lower out-of-pocket costs during the lease period.Flexibility: Leasing provides flexibility at the end of the lease term. You can choose to return the vehicle, lease a new one, or even purchase the leased car if you've grown attached to it. Cons of Leasing a Car Mileage Restrictions: Leases often come with mileage limits. Exceeding these limits can result in additional charges, so it's important to consider your driving habits.No Ownership Equity: Unlike purchasing, leasing doesn't contribute to building equity in the vehicle. At the end of the lease, you don't own the car unless you choose to buy it.Cost Over Time: While monthly payments may be lower, leasing over an extended period could result in higher overall costs compared to purchasing. Is Leasing Right for You? Leasing a car can be a good idea if you prioritize lower monthly payments, enjoy driving new vehicles, and prefer not to worry about long-term ownership. It's an attractive option for those who want to experience the latest technology and avoid the responsibilities of long-term maintenance. However, if you value ownership equity, plan to keep a vehicle for an extended period, or anticipate high mileage, purchasing may be a more suitable choice. Conclusion The decision to lease a car is a personal one that depends on your individual preferences, financial situation, and driving habits. At Elite Auto Lease, we understand that every driver's needs are unique. Our team is here to provide expert guidance, transparent information, and a range of leasing options to help you determine whether leasing a car aligns with your goals.

Balanced Diet: Prioritize a varied diet encompassing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Minimize consumption of processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie drinks. Portion Control: Pay attention to your serving sizes. Even nutritious foods can lead to weight gain if eaten in excessive amounts. Hydration: Ensure you drink ample water throughout the day. Thirst can often be confused with hunger, resulting in needless snacking. Regular Exercise: Include both cardiovascular activities such as walking, running or cycling, and strength training like weightlifting in your routine. Exercise is beneficial for burning calories, building muscle, and enhancing overall health. Steer clear of crash diets: These extreme diets or significantly low-calorie intakes can be detrimental to your health, causing muscle loss, fatigue, and nutrient deficiencies. Ensure adequate sleep: It's crucial to get enough quality sleep each night as sleep deprivation can disrupt your metabolism and result in weight gain. Manage stress effectively: High stress levels can trigger overeating or lead to unhealthy food choices. Discover healthy stress management strategies such as meditation, yoga, or engaging in hobbies you love. Monitor your progress: Maintain a food diary or utilize a weight loss app to track your dietary intake and exercise routines. Tracking can assist you in maintaining accountability and identifying areas that need improvement. Be Patient and Persistent: Sustainable weight loss requires time.

I doubt the after sales service of OnePlus 6. Also OnePlus device are meant to work for a year or so… If we need a long lasting phone and a sexy device without copycat design and excellent service after sales we need to opt S8 or s9 if we have a huge budget."},{"instruction":"Does your dog ever act as if you offended him/her?","output":"Yes, all the time! If I do something unfamiliar to my dog, she often will give me a “look”, and to me, it looks like an offended glare. Of course, in reality, I believe it’s just a look of discomfort and confusion, as she doesn’t understand what just happened. Something slightly more extreme can happen when I do something my dogs really don’t like (usually giving them a bath), where they’ll physically avoid me for a while after. This usually stops happening when I get to know my dog better and the dog learns that me doing those things doesn’t mean that I hate them, but their “cold shoulder” treatment is kind of funny! Either way, they usually get over it quickly, and we make up and are back to being best friends before the day is over."},{"instruction":"What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?","output":"<sigh> All questions of the “next number in the series” form have an infinite number of answers. There is no “correct” answer. You can come up with a complicated arithmetic rule that allows literally any number to be the next in the sequence. (It’s true! Ask a mathematician!) If you allow answers that driven by non-arithmetic processes (like “The month in which the N’th US president was born” or “The number of letters in the N’th word of Webster’s Dictionary”) then you get even more ways to come up with answers. In the end, if you’re forced to come up with an answer (eg to pass an IQ test), you have to try to think of the “simplest” answer - but one person’s simplicity is another person’s complexity…so even that doesn’t really work."},{"instruction":"What is the formula for sport betting?","output":"The best sport betting hacks and tips is here !

Why would you think a homeowner would “install a fire hydrant for his own private use”? How on earth would he make any use of it? That’s just not a thing.

It is safe to conclude that there are more naturally occurring triangles than squares in the universe. A square must have four sides of equal length and four very exactly 90 degree angles. A triangle requires 3 variable angles three sides of variable lengths. If you take a bag of bamboo skewers and dump it out on the floor, you will be able to count multiple triangles spontaneously formed. The number of squares will be significantly less. The conditions necessary to qualify as a square are much less likely to occur naturally than the conditions necessary to qualify as a triangle. So, statistically triangles win. Yay triangles!"},{"instruction":"Did Yoko Ono attend Linda McCartney's funeral?","output":"Yoko lives in Split, Croatia.

At a minimum, for most if them, we probably want to enjoin them against any weapons ownership in their lifetimes, and curtail their ability to sponsor relatives to immigrate to the USA. Jail terms for those who committed war crimes or who caused American casualties. Safer to have them in jail than in exile where they will simply be recruited again on a slow day."},{"instruction":"Who are the best Canadian immigration consultants in Chennai?","output":"well, i’m not a prospect i have worked for certain top immigration companies in Chennai in major roles 1, Y - Axis 2, More Visas 3, Green Tree Immigration 4, Le Shamrock (my current company) when i had to work for Y - Axis [LINKED_TEXT: India's No.1 Immigration & Visa Consultant] [URL: https://www.y-axis.com/overseas-careers/?_bt=220986575751&_bk=www%20y%20axis%20com&_bm=e&_bn=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_prQi9fU4QIVQR0rCh0_hgWREAAYASAAEgLzEPD_BwE] they seemed to be the best consultant at present, they offer you with Free Evaluation, Why not because they are the popular immigration Brand currently, and they complete the whole Immigration Process with Just 1 L or 1.1 L which seems to be very cheap in cost.. and so Peoples always prefer Y axis and i hope People are not bothered or aware about the charges because it fits their Pocket and they don’t look into the quality of the service or the response More visas [LINKED_TEXT: MoreVisas - Immigration Consultants India] [URL: https://www.morevisas.com/] the management was kind of lethargic with the clients after the payment and currently they have certain bad reviews which has instantly dropped their Rating to be Low and i would be really awful to give an open statement about More visas… But still i would not want to defame them probably the management should work more into improving their services Probably, Green Tree Immigration [LINKED_TEXT: Immigration consultant and Visa services in India] [URL: http://www.greentreeimmigration.com/] is kind of unique where they don’t provide with Free Evaluation Report and their evaluation Report is precise and provides you a lot of information through Report and their service,response to their clients are really great, they are really very transparent to the client Regarding the Proof of funds and all whole Process…Probably i felt these people are great in the way they approach the clients , and the management gives target to their employees to process the sufficient profiles for Express Entry in a given Time-line, the process flow flow show indicate the apt Time-line committed up to the client even if the client delays with Documents the Processing Executives get yelled , kind of good gesture they really care for every individual whom initiates the process at Green Tree Le Shamrock [LINKED_TEXT: Le Shamrock Consultancy and Immigration | Most Trusted VISA partner] [URL: https://www.shamrockconsultancy.com/] my current company is really great they are the best in the world probably i’m really happy working with shamrock because they respect their clients and they are very transparent with the process, probably they got awarded for the best consultant of the year 2018 its gives us a pride to work at shamrock, the management is very friendly to the clients and to their employees they complete the in around 6 months probably they are the fastest immigration service provider at Chennai"},{"instruction":"Do we have the theory of everything?

How can we select in a particular fund for a longer period of 15+ years?","output":"However much we as investors wish, there are no “invest and forget it” funds, because the performance of securities is beyond the control of any fund manager. You could invest in a fund, but review the investment every few years and then decide whether to continue. Please remember, there is no prize for being sentimentally attached to a fund, you would instead get a loss in comparison to better options at that time by sticking to that fund. As mutual funds can be bought or sold at any time, it’s easy to exit and invest in another fund."},{"instruction":"What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?","output":"With 620 marks, I'm definitely not participating in All India counseling as I can get better colleges through state quota.

If the grout is tight against the pipe coming out of the wall it helps to hold the pipe solid and take strain away from the shower connector in the wall. The problems occur when that connector takes all the strain and a pinhole leak starts spewing water into the wall cavity behind the tiles. Then eventually the entire wall is ruined, rotted out, and the shower needs a 8,000 plus gut out and rebuild. Probably more. So finding a better way to hang all your essential shower supplies is a better idea."},{"instruction":"For prochoice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?","output":"One day, they might find a way to transfer a pregnancy to inside a man's body, and then he'd get a say. Of course, he'd have to have a Caesarian, because there's no other way."},{"instruction":"What are some good unknown destinations to travel in 2019?","output":"2019 has some great unknown destinations that are worth exploring. From beautiful beaches in India to volcanoes in South America that spew fire and gusty winds, there is something for everyone. An underrated spot that I would highly recommend is the Azores Islands off the coast of Portugal. The tranquil scenery and picture perfect villages make it a great place to unplug and unwind. Another great spot that is often overlooked is the Northern Lights of Norway. Spectacular views of the Aurora Borealis against a backdrop of pristine snowscapes will take your breath away. So if you're looking for an off-the-beaten-path adventure, these two destinations will provide an unforgettable experience."},{"instruction":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","output":"I got plenty of movies that I’ve been wanting to add to my DVD/Blu-ray collection for some time, including: and finally… Yeah, I’m a big movie buff… I also received three different packages of summer sausage with various cheeses, a movie trivia game, some books, and an Axe gift set. Needless to say, I was very appreciative of all I received this year, especially after the crazy hectic year we all have had. However, it was also nice to eat good food with the ones I love the most.

There are many other restaurants serving biriyani with awesome taste which I have tried Hyderbadi biriyani house from Old Airport road quantity for 1.5 or 2 people ,little more spicy but awesome taste ,but boneless biriyani here is not upto the mark otherwise excellent taste with price around 300.Nandhana Palace in Indiranagar, great place to have Andhra style biriyani and price is 280 for chicken biriyani and 380 for mutton biriyani ,the best dish is their Nellore style mutton biriyani, Andhra style chilli chicken.

Its HER wedding. Don't ruin it. You and your apology have no place there.You're breaking the restraining order so now likely the police might get involved. At her wedding. Again horrible idea.Your apology may mean absolutely nothing to her. We don't know your past or your relationship but that may have died long ago. You might think it matters but she might not. Sounds like you've made this bed. It may take years to fix it, if ever.If you want to be invited to her wedding, that's her choice. Since there's a no contact order, about the only thing I can imagine you could do is contact a mutual family member or friend to let her know you would like to apologize and it's up to her if she wants to accept that. I don't know the specifics of your restraining order but even that could be in violation.Her wedding has absolutely nothing to do with you and your relationship with her.

What sort of strange, dystopian hysteria is leading to this idea?So, how bad is the internet, or ubiquitous smartphones everywhere, or how bad is life in the real world . . . perhaps you may have never seen or experienced VR, which would make this question even more interesting, in that this bizarre gap between imagined hysteria and what’s really there is its own phenomena to make note of. VR is what you make of it. There are actually many practical and beneficial applications for it, and yes, there can be some rather dark or just plain ridiculous applications for it. Are you imagining civilization is going to suddenly become overtaken by VR zombies, perpetually adrift in imaginary worlds while the real world around them decays into morbid collapse, or perhaps the VR people are suddenly imbued with special powers that they use to control the world . . . or whatever? Well, maybe you’ve seen a few too many sci-fi movies or novels, but really, it’s not that big of a deal. I know, ever since the film “Ready Player One” came out, now there is a specific culture meme wrapped around this vision of the VR / metaverse world, some convinced that this is where humanity is heading . . . oh no!!! Well, try to calm down a bit, take a deep breath, the end of civilization as it’s currently known to be isn’t quite meeting its demise at the moment. Yes, it will become a popular new thing, maybe . . . I recall having worked on various VR projects since the mid 1990s, although now, of course, the VR interface tech is much more accessible, computers and graphics processors are vastly more powerful, and high speed networks can support 3D interactive content on a vast consumer scale, so it’s more likely to catch on this time around. Will there be some downsides to it, at least for some? Yes, probably, as is the case with just about anything else in the evolving tech world. Should we be cringing in fear of the foreboding virtual world hovering on the horizon like the dark hand of Sauron? No, not really. You’ll be fine, good luck"},{"instruction":"Where can I find a loan shark fast?","output":"Under no circumstances do you want to find one.

Vaping vs smoking • Vaping is not smoking. • Vape devices heat e-liquid, which usually contains nicotine, propylene glycol and/or glycerol, plus flavours, to create an aerosol that people breathe in. • The main difference between vaping and smoking tobacco is that vaping does not involve burning. Burning tobacco creates toxins that cause serious illness and death. • A vape device heats a liquid (often containing nicotine) to produce an aerosol (or a vapour) that can be inhaled. The vapour delivers nicotine to the user in a way that is relatively free of other chemicals. Non-smokers and vaping • If you don’t smoke, don’t vape. • If you’ve never smoked or used other tobacco products then don’t start vaping. • Vaping products are intended for people who smoke. Vaping and young people • Young people are experimenting with vaping, and those who try vaping are also those who are more likely to try smoking at a later time. However, it is not possible to say from current evidence that vaping causes people to smoke. • Smoking rates for both adults and young people are continuing to drop in New Zealand. There is no evidence that vaping is normalising smoking. • In New Zealand youth smoking rates continue to decline and daily use of vaping devices is rare and is largely confined to those who have smoked.

We would be incapable of detecting an nuclear explosion on Jupiter, though Juno might spot it. On the moon? We might just barely be able to briefly see it, though almost certainly not. You’d have to be looking right at the moon right at the correct moment, and under great viewing conditions. Telescopes would be able to see it. Effects on the Earth? None.

It’s very possible that the upper-limiting factors are either how much fuel and air they can gulp down and how fast, or the thermal and structural limits of the airframe itself. Drag and compressive resistance increase at a faster rate than ramjet efficiency, so if air and fuel and materials limitations were taken out of the equation, you could chart engine performance against drag and compression resistance, and at some point those arcs will intersect and additional thrust can not yield additional speed, and that is your theoretical limit*. In fact, Speed records of the SR-71 (and its even-faster A-12 ancestor) remain largely-classified, and theoretical limits are just that, theoretical. The CIA and USAF would not have been happy with jockey pilots hot-rodding around in expensive, irreplaceable, critical assets loaded with valuable and sensitive technology and data. We know it could easily do better than mach 3.2, and sometimes set new records accidentally. * In practice, probably the thermal softening point of some component in the afterburners, where the ramjet combustion takes place."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"Well if some can mention Master-Slave… Electrical connectors have “gender”.

See if you can identify the connector genders of these: BUT to keep SJWs happy, sometimes one wants a genderless connector. Behold the APC-7 hermaphroditic connector.

Of course the mermaid in question would have to be one of the nicer, more compassionate ones…as some mermaids in myths, legends, and movies aren’t very nice at all…and I wish to survive the experience…so we could repeat it if we want to! IF the female vampire is of good morals…and does NOT kill anyone, surviving from either “non-lethal” “donations” of blood…or from blood banks…I might be willing to do it with a vampire as well…but far more mermaids are compassionate and moral creatures than are vampires…so my odds are far better in finding a kind, compassionate, and moral mermaid than to find a vampire with those qualities…although they are not completely unknown…even among the “undead”! So I would personally prefer a kind, loving and compassionate mermaid over a vampire…although, if the vampire also has these qualities…and is morally adverse to killing anyone…I might consider her as well!"},{"instruction":"w do I see who liked something on Twitter?","output":"Hi there, You can your profile insight that what is the your profile status.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","output":"I’ve written about this before: For those with the means (and I am very aware of the inequity here), private schools offer choice. If you want a religious education for your child, you can have that. If you are looking for a particular program, a flexible schedule because your child has other commitments (dedicated athlete, actor, model, etc.), or a certain type of education, you can find that in private schools. My 6–12 school has a learning skills program. About a third of our students need some kind of support—they have high-functioning autism, dyslexia, ADD or ADHD, for example—so they can attend our regular classes and get extra help during the school day. (That support costs extra, by the way.) In addition, we often get students who struggle with anxiety, or who have been bullied in their public schools. We’re a small school, we have specialized staff who can support those students while they still attend a regular (albeit private) high school. We can offer choice: My school also offers a couple of special dual-diploma programs, one in the arts for pre-professional students, and one based on learning and understanding about environment, politics, history, public policy, etc. for juniors and seniors. All seniors participate in a year-long seminar, studying a topic of their choice. Is every teacher better at teaching? I can’t say. What I can say is that we have the freedom to teach what we think is important, not what the state or school board tells us. Does that mean we teach all kinds of weird, off-beat things? No, but we’re often the first to adopt/create new courses that you would see five or 10 years later in the public schools. The other thing about teachers is that with a lighter student load, they have the time and space to get to know the students better than a public school teacher may have. We also have many roles in our school, by necessity, so we all see students in different arenas. Private schools are a community and teachers are a big part of that. For parents of middle schoolers, that’s particularly reassuring, as the leap from elementary to middle in public school is often a huge one. I’m sure that for some, private school means bragging rights, or future professional connections. But not all private schools are Ivy League pipelines. We offer choice, flexibility and a personal community. For many parents, those who can pay, and those who apply for financial aid, that’s what they want/need for their children."},{"instruction":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Library Genesishttp://libgen.is] [URL: http://libgen.is/]"},{"instruction":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","output":"By doing things that don’t involve obsessing about food.

When I planned my wedding, I actually took my maid of honor with me to the bridal shop because I wanted her to try styles that she liked and felt comfortable in. I did the actual picking, but if she had disliked the style I picked, I would have kept looking until I found something that would work. If any of my other bridesmaids disliked their dresses, I never heard about it. If someone really hated the dress I chose and refused to wear it, I guess one way to handle it would have been to go back to the bridal shop and pick a different style in the same color as the other girls’ dresses. My wedding was 22 years ago. When one of my cousins was married 6 years ago, his bride chose a few different dress styles in the same color for her bridesmaids, which I think is a great idea, because a dress that might look good on someone who is tall and thin might not look as good on someone shorter or curvier, etc. All the bridesmaids wore different dress styles (not radically different…some had spaghetti straps, some had wider straps, some were strapless, the skirts might have had different lengths) but they were all the same color and they were nicely coordinated…the girls all looked like they were part of the same wedding party. Not long after my own wedding, my husband was a groomsman at one of his friends’ weddings. The bride chose a beautiful dress for her bridesmaids that unfortunately would only have looked good on a person who was thin or at a correct weight. The dresses had partially open sides and were mostly open-backed with straps that crisscrossed in the back. Wherever there wasn’t material from the straps, there was skin. The dresses were also sleeveless and form fitting. With the exception of the bride’s sister, the bridesmaids were pouring out of their dresses, and not in a flattering way. Just as these dresses were designed to call attention to someone’s best physical attributes, they also called attention to problem areas. I was of the opinion that knowing the body types of her bridesmaids, the bride should have chosen a style that was more flattering and provided more coverage. I had the misfortune of overhearing one immature male guest say to his girlfriend as the bridesmaids walked down the aisle, “That girl does NOT have the body for that dress.” So, I would say that if a bridesmaid doesn’t like the dress you’ve chosen because she isn’t comfortable with the way it fits (maybe it accentuates a part of her body she isn’t comfortable with or doesn’t want to show), it would probably be a good idea to look at other styles. As far as the color of the dress goes, I don’t think the bride should have to bend on that one. Thank you again for the a2a. I hope my answer helps."},{"instruction":"Do you believe in karma? Why or why not?","output":"Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Lets start with what is Karma. Karma are consequences of your actions traveling across space and time.In Indian philosophy, karma refers to both, your actions and consequences of your actions.It is neither good nor bad. You act in destructive manner, consequences are destructive. You act in constructive manner, consequences are constructive. Whatever you did and whatever the consequences both are karma. The statements such as “Karma is bitch”, “Karma is about to get you”, and many such statements with a sentiment of revenge, are inaccurate. Does everything happen because of Karma? Consider the following hypothetical example: You plant a seed. This is your action. Karma.The seed sprouts into a plant. This is consequence of your action. Karma.You nourish the plant and tend to it regularly. [Action = Karma]The plant eventually grows into a tree. [Consequence = Karma]It bears fruits, which humans, birds, animals consume, provides shade. [Consequence = Karma]. Good or Bad? You will answer good, as its doing good to someone else.It is now a dense tree. On a stormy weather, thunder and rain, one of its branches break, injures a person taking shelter under the tree. [Consequence = Karma]. Good or Bad? Additionally, it was action of the injured person to take shelter under the tree. It was that persons action [Action = Karma]. You get the point. Its a simple cause and effect relation. Both cause and effect referred to as Karma. Good and Bad are labels we provide depending on the perspective and the outcome. In the context of above example, your karma were good for the animals, birds and people that the tree fed and provided shelter.your karma were bad for the injured.BUT, it was also the injured persons karma who took shelter at the wrong place and wrong time. He would not know, it is the outcome that labeled the act of taking shelter as a wrong action. So YES Everything that happens is Karma.

Early Morning (around 2–3 a.m.): It's generally the time we tend to drift off to the sweet world of dreams. Having your friends next door and a more than 100mbps internet gives a huge advantage to Netflix and her brethren over us. Late night 'Ramu ki chai' is one of the pious daily deed which most of us follow religiously. Trust me this will be your sleeping time too, once you become a part! Around 8 a.m. : It's the time we realise we have our classes. Waking at almost 7:45 is like a dream come true for some of us, but mostly we do try to wake up at 7:30, a quick freshen up and we hurry to the ‘Himalayas', our mess, climb two floors grab the plate , serve ourselves some breakfast and boils the most important meal of the day is eaten. Then we pedal to our classes, yes pedal coz they are around a km away. And then classes continue till 12 noon. 'The Lunch Break' : The happily welcomed lunch break, by one and all, after around 4 hrs of classes it's like a little down spirits and a hungry mind, we pedal down to the Himalayas again and get ourselves served lunch, i.e. a predecided meal menu, available on apps (yes we have our own apps with menu), and after lunch some of us do sneak half an hour of rest before the remaining classes. But it's a miracle to wake up in half an hour for many! After lunch showdown: In these classes even our profs acknowledge our drowsy dropping heads with certain afternoon nap jokes to lift up the mood. Continuing with the classes, we eagerly await for the hour to end… *Now there are two divisions, labs and no labs Labs: When we have labs, we just go to our labs and experience the practical applications of learning, a true eye opener for us, some of the labs which I have attended till now; applied mechanics, physics, chemistry (all 3), strength of materials, fluids, cs etc. These labs are truly insightful except for a couple of lazy days. Personally it's a great learning opportunity! No Labs: This is a hard time for us to figure out, sometimes it's just working on a task at hand, sometimes it's just dead drop on the bed and dozing off to Neverland while others it's just a random match of pool or table tennis. If the classes end late, they are followed by 'Ramu ki chai’ and snacks. It's like the go to place in the campus… The real wake up call ( around 5 pm ): The campus starts bubbling with energy as the evening approaches, people with various sports equipments for tennis, badminton, cricket, football start going to various grounds, courts and tracks. Me personally it's either a football, basketball, tennis racquet or cricket bat along with rare badminton and table tennis… It's like a whole different vibe. Sports are encouraged and thus even we love play a lot. Most of the hostel grounds are filled with 'enthu junta' (insti slang), the enthusiastic people, shouting at the top of their voices with calls like pass kar, maarke dikha, aaja ab, marjaa, goaaaaaallll very common to be heard… Also the swimming pool is filled with a no. of people. Many people hit gym on a regular basis too.This is most of the evening we guys have!! Won't mention time now just the things, coz everything now is pure energy, passion, love and truly amazing. It's our lifeline in insti… After a quick shower and dinner, there are different groups of people who do differ things. Some of us might attend various sessions being arranged by different clubs while others hangout with friends at various spots. Saturday night is reserved for the movies at the OAT( OPEN AIR THEATRE) , yes we have it too!! These sessions are great for freshies and other junta alike. We often tend to have dinners at different places around the campus like at phoenix, kake da dhaba etc. Hanging and chilling at CCD is something very common among people . Late night movie screenings in TV rooms and 12 pm football are very common for a lot of people! Cycling around the campus for a bit, certain people among us do pick up books for a time, but most of us are last minute achievers, we only pick books before the exams. Futsal visits to grounds are a common ritual followed once a week by me and my friends. Other things like gossiping, having a juice at coolbiz, binge watching again are quite common.. The club culture comes to life literally at night when the center for innovation sparks as a day, with many minds and technical enthusiasts working on prototypes and ideas with a huge amount of effort. Been a part, it's a great feeling. That's it mostly, I did miss the leg pulling and the prank doing part will surely add later! That's a typical day at IIT MADRAS when the quizzes or endsems are not around :) Will surely add the pictures when I get to the campus, it's a new phone and quarantine sic.."},{"instruction":"My left eyelid has been twitching loads for the past month or more.

They can all interbreed with fertile offspring, yet are considered different species because they usually don’t. So they were never “distantly” related.

I know this because I watched his YouTube series “Best Shape of My Life.” In that series he is losing his COVID weight, as well as working on his memoir. The memoir entitled “Will” dives into the actors defining moments in his life — going far back to early childhood. “Mr. Nice Guy” has a surprisingly troubled past. I was surprised when I found out about it. He seems so perfect. Everybody loves Will Smith. Didn’t know that underneath that charm and charisma was pain. His father was physically and emotionally abusive towards his mother. Will the oldest son, felt helpless in those moments. He wanted to help his mother but couldn’t. He felt an enormous amount of guilt and shame because of this. My opinion, is that Will suffers from PTSD and he was triggered by his wife’s reaction to that joke. The hurt on her face, triggered him into a flashback of being a helpless child and seeing his mother unable to defend herself. He no longer is a helpless child, he is an adult with physical strength and is fully capable of defending his family. He did what he couldn’t do — as a child. Was it right? He probably went too far. He could of left it at yelling at Chris Rock from his seat. But hey — he’s human. In the moment he felt that was the right thing to do. Jada’s hair loss could also be more serious than we know. Reacting this way does not make him a bad person, it just makes him human. > Chris Rock will be okay. It was just a punch, that happened to be on live tv — on one of the biggest nights of television. The punch was not that bad, the only things hurt were egos. Chris Rock, put some ice on that. For those saying Will Smith should be locked up That is laughable. Locked up for a single punch? No he should not be locked up for that. Every man has been punched in the face at least once(right)? Y’all are blowing this way out of proportion. You are demonizing the man for having feelings and a painful past and punching someone. > Yes, he has an incredible amount of privledge to walk on stage, punch a man in his face and sit back down in his seat. Life is not fair, but it did make him look like a badass. He is going though a transition In his speech he mentioned he is going through a transition in his life. He didn’t have to say that for me to know. He has been though a lot publicly in the past few years. His transition probably started with him beginning his memoir or with the public humiliation he experienced from his wife’s “affair.” He said that he uncovered a lot of things in the process of writing his book. Things that he had blocked from his memory and old feelings resurfaced. He is living his truth. I have a feeling we are going to hear more about his new life's path.

Similarly, physicist John Bell showed that quantum mechanics is incompatible with locality, locality being the common sense notion that an event in one location can have no instantaneous effect on events in another location. He hoped that experiments would confirm that the universe is local and that quantum mechanics contains an error. He was disappointed when experiments showed the opposite result, that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct, and that the universe is NON-local."},{"instruction":"f an atheist doesn't believe in God, do they also not believe in Satan?","output":"The twin concepts of God and Satan are firmly rooted in the idea of belief.

HSL (a–d) and HSV (e–h). Above (a, e): cut-away 3D models of each. Below: two-dimensional plots showing two of a model's three parameters at once, holding the other constant: cylindrical shells (b, f) of constant saturation, in this case the outside surface of each cylinder; horizontal cross-sections (c, g) of constant HSL lightness or HSV value, in this case the slices halfway down each cylinder; and rectangular vertical cross-sections (d, h) of constant hue, in this case of hues 0° red and its complement 180° cyan. HSL (for hue, saturation, lightness ) and HSV (for hue, saturation, value ; also known as HSB , for hue, saturation, brightness ) are alternative representations of the RGB color model , designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top. The HSL representation models the way different paints mix together to create color in the real world, with the lightness dimension resembling the varying amounts of black or white paint in the mixture (e.g. to create \\"light red\\", a red pigment can be mixed with white paint; this white paint corresponds to a high \\"lightness\\" value in the HSL representation). Fully saturated colors are placed around a circle at a lightness value of 1 ⁄ 2 , with a lightness value of 0 or 1 corresponding to fully black or white, respectively. Meanwhile, the HSV representation models how colors appear under light. The difference between HSL and HSV is that a color with maximum lightness in HSL is pure white, but a color with maximum value/brightness in HSV is analogous to shining a white light on a colored object (e.g. shining a bright white light on a red object causes the object to still appear red, just brighter and more intense, while shining a dim light on a red object causes the object to appear darker and less bright). The issue with both HSV and HSL is that these approaches do not effectively separate color into their three value components according to human perception of color. [1] [2] [3] This can be seen when the saturation settings are altered – it is quite easy to notice the difference in perceptual lightness despite the \\"V\\" or \\"L\\" setting being fixed. Basic principle [ edit ] HSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries ( fig. 2 ), with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the red primary at 0°, passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the neutral , achromatic , or gray colors ranging, from top to bottom, white at lightness 1 (value 1) to black at lightness 0 (value 0).

I would usually get a small breakfast or maybe just a coffee. I would usually end up spending a lot of time sitting there either reading or writing. I usually sat in the same area every time I went in, if not my favorite corner booth. There was a waitress about my age maybe a few years older who had recently started working there and usually had the section that I sat in. I worked but had no real bills to speak of seeing that I was still living at home. It was common for me to leave a 5 - 10 tip depending on how long I had been there. One night I went in about my usual time 12.30am and had a small breakfast and a never ending cup of coffee. By this time the waitress and myself became friends I'll call her Anna. I had stayed through the bar rush, I always laughed how Anna would handle the drunk guys flirting with her. When I left I realized that I had brought just enough to cover the check, and could not leave a tip. I felt horrible and told Anna that I would make it up to her. The next time I was in there maybe a week later I had parked to where I could see the area I was going to sit but unless someone (from the restaurant) was really looking wouldn't see me. I went in ordered just coffee maybe 2 and of course it was Anna who was my waitress that night (by this time the manager would tease us saying how we were secretly dating (I only wish)). Upon leaving I had done my usual and left my tip folded up just to mess with Anna as she had the habit of straightening and facing the bills all in the same direction as she would put them into her tip book. I on purposely left while she was back in the kitchen and not paying attention to me leaving. Sitting in my pickup I watched as she returned to my table to retrieve her tip and wipe down the table. As I watched her unfold the bills and saw her eyes go wide and the words oh my God cross her lips (I don't read lips but it was obvious.) I had left a 50 bill wrapped inside a couple of 1's. The next time I went in I barely had a chance to look around when I saw a short blonde haired person come flying at me. She had moved out on her own and sharing an apartment with a friend, her rent took just about all of her pay while she went to the local college. After she let me go she thanked me for her new work shoes. We stayed friends for a few more months till I left for Marine Corps Boot Camp. That just happens to be the most memorable for me but far from being the largest tip I have left. After I got out of the Marine Corps I started work in the casino business and relied heavily on tips as the main staple of my income. I find tipping to be very important and will always tip generously if the wait staff had made an effort to make my meal enjoyable. I have also been known on occasion to tip the kitchen staff if my meal was particularly well prepared.

This decision did not go down well with her family. In response, they locked poor Vijaylaxmi up without any food or water for several days. As time passed by, the relationship remained strained. Vijaylaxmi’s parents were ridiculed for having an unmarried daughter and she was often shunned within her community. Then came a turn of events- a neighbour’s 14-year-old married daughter tragically died during childbirth. Shocked and with their eyes now open to the dangers of child marriage, her parents began to understand Vijaylaxmi’s defiance and to support their daughter’s decision. Together wither her family, they campaigned from door-to-door. One of her brothers is a horoscope reader and astrologer, so he used his social identity to convince the girls’ families. While Vijaylaxmi’s parents reasoned with the brides’ parents, Vijaylaxmi spoke to the young girls and told them about the health and social hazards of marrying before the age of 18. Their combined efforts eventually helped stop 15 child marriages in their village and surrounding villages in a very short span of time.

We must wait until the investigators complete their work and release their report to find out how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. That said, we can’t help but speculate, and one factor that may play an important role is that the company that owned the helicopter did not have FAA certification for the company’s pilots to fly under instrument flight rules. They were and are required to fly only under visual flight rules, meaning they can’t fly in fog or in any conditions where they can’t see the airspace around them.

It happened to me as well, 22 years ago: a failing company in Spain downsized and tried to force me to “resign voluntarily”. But resignation is reserved for employees who choose to quit on their free own will (not forced to leave, so no severance package and no unemployement benefits), which was a lie and would leave me starving. I politely answered: Whenever I'm not needed, I never expected privileges/medals, but at least I expect to get the typical unemployement cash (nothing special, just that).I would gladly give expensive gifts and even my own unemployement cash as a present to the company if I could afford to do so, but I can't: I really need it to survive.I mean no harm to the company, I really want to help on everything else. But please let me survive in return, that's all I ask. So no, I didn't sign my “voluntary resignation” and they took no offence because the tone of my answer was not hostile, but too logical to be rejected (survival).

Keep in mind that State Troopers are literally the last type of LEO’s in America that you’d want to be pulled over for any reason let alone going 100+mph. The first time was in September of 2018, it was after 6am in the morning and I was in my way home from work after working a 16 hour shift. As I was going…well speeding down the interstate, I see a State Trooper behind me with his lights flashing so I pull over. As he walks up to my car he asks me “Any excuse why you were going 103 in a 70?” and I reply with just a “No” as I hand him my DL. Mind you I was wearing my CO uniform during all of this. After about 10 minutes goes by, he comes back and says that he could have cited me for reckless driving but decided not to. Thank goodness for that. The vibe I got from him was that he seemed to be kind of a dick and he may very well not like Correctional Officers. The training academy’s for troopers and corrections officers are both in Selma, AL and their training buildings are on the same state property so we’d see each other every day and they (perhaps not all) tend to look down on the ADOC. Correctional officers are often viewed as the red headed step children of law enforcement in America. All in all I could really care less as most troopers (and police officers) wouldn’t even have the courage to step foot inside a prison but I digress. So the trooper let me know that my court date would be October of next month but I could pay online within 48 hours. Obviously I was going to pay online and not waste my time having to go to court. Well 48 hours comes around and nothing. I could not find my ticket anywhere on the website when I typed in my case number. Ohh well I thought. I simply wait another 24 hours. Still nothing showed up as I typed my case number from the ticket in. I wasn’t really in panic mode but I couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t appearing online. So basically every day until my court date I would check and nothing would appear. “Is this guy being a jerk and wanting me to have to show up in court?” I thought to myself. I was not happy about it at all but I was totally powerless to do anything about it. My court date finally had arrived and I was all dressed up for my appearance along with several dozen others that day. Even some county jail inmates were over to the side. None of them seemed to recognize me from work. It would have been kind of embarrassing if they did. I was initially seated towards the back of the room and I simply waited my turn to be heard. The judge was a older middle aged woman and I got a good vibe from her. One thing I can distinctly remember is that she was automatically throwing out tickets from particular areas that she considered to be speed traps. Well as it was my turn to walk up I told her my situation and she directed my over to her right which was a bailiff (a man appearing to be over the age of 65) and what appeared to be an assistant district attorney. I told them my name and they couldn’t find it anywhere on the list. I showed them my ticket and told them my situation and the bailiff told me that it was likely that the trooper wasn’t doing his job properly. Well I’ll be dammed, none of these people weren’t even expecting me today. So the bailiff informed me that he would have the ticket thrown out and it would reflect on my driving record. I told them thank you and went on my way. That saved me from having to pay a lot of money. The second time was just a few weeks after my ticket from September of 2018 had been thrown out of court. I just thought to myself that I was a dummy and I was going to have to pay up this time. Here we go again. Same question, “Any reason why you were doing 103 in a 70?” I said “No”. I was in my CO uniform again. Well after a brief talking to, this time the trooper let me off with a warning. He seemed to be a bit of a nicer fellow. I just thought to myself, I can’t believe what is happening right now. I have dodged two bullets that would have cost me several hundred dollars and would have drove my insurance sky high. Since then I haven’t been pulled over for speeding at all. While I’d be lying if I said I haven’t sped since then, I’ve become a lot more cautious. In the USA, you would almost have a better chance of winning the lottery than you would getting pulled over twice by a State Trooper, let alone within two months, for driving 100+ mph and not having to pay a ticket for either one.

The enneagram is based on ancient wisdom and is one of the most popular systems used by personality buffs on the internet. Like almost all typologies (including scientific ones like Big 5 and HEXACO) it has lacked an evolutionary perspective. Nario and Krüger have endeavoured to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the nine enneagram types using fictitious examples of stone age types and modern neuroscience and genetics. So, when I saw the book online I didn’t hesitate a moment to get it for my Kindle library. I did love the basic idea of investigating the nine types from an evolutionary point of view and connecting the picture to recent research in genetics (genome-wide association studies) and neuroscience. However, the authors are too eager to connect everything and miss the many details and problems that their approach brings. To begin with, there is almost no social differentiation in foragers (hunter-gatherers) to warrant the idea that cavemen had nine different personality types. There is some minor division between men and women, hunting vs gathering, and even this division is not very strict as women are actively involved in hunting as well as men in foraging. The only distinct role in foragers are shamans, but they are far from being universal and the Hadza, for example, lack shamans. Many of the nine roles would simply not work for egalitarian hunter-gatherer bands. The authors often lack detailed knowledge of foragers, e.g. describing their bands as “clans”, which is a serious miscategorization of foragers social organization. Clans are often at war with each other, foragers have a flexible split and join pattern regarding foreign bands. Enneagram type 8, “the challenger” or “the warrior” as the authors call it, does not fit anywhere into egalitarian forager organisations that have no permanent leadership. Leadership is temporary and based on competence, rather than a challenging personality type. Likewise, the authors assign the most ambitious type, 3 “The Achiever” (called “The Hunter” in the book) to the most successful hunters. According to the authors “Hunters” are driven by testosterone, have a sense of self-confidence, exaggerated optimism, decreased levels of fear and empathy, increased impulsiveness and risk-taking, and a tendency to assume one’s own opinion is correct while ignoring other opinions. While hunters are certainly higher in testosterone than gatherers, some of these traits would actually be detrimental to real hunter-gatherers who hunt in groups, frequently make hypotheses about possible trajectories of their prey and consult each other and rarely act impulsively. The last thing a hunter would do is boast about his success, they do the opposite, downplaying it which is called “shaming the meat” and a part of hunter-gatherer egalitarianism. This is what authors get when they don’t do their homework properly. A hunter is more likely a 5 (an Investigator or a “Tracker” aka “Hunter”) than a 3 (a Goalgetter) on the enneagram. The work of hunters is much more similar to detective work than hardcore action. I guess this is the reason why we 5s are so into scavenger hunts or finding easter eggs in video games. Foragers don’t kill dangerous animals like lions, at least not if they have a choice. Two enneagram types, 4s and 5s, called “Wizards” and “Sages”, respectively in the book, are hard to justify from an evolutionary point of view, as both types tend to be loners. They might be the closest thing to a shaman, but a 4 who feels painfully different from his peers so that she needs to go against the grain and a 5 who loves to overthink in his cave instead of going hunting simply would have found it difficult to survive and reproduce. To summarize, here are some of the main problems with the book and assigning evolutionary profiles to enneagram types: No scientific model yields anywhere near nine factors for personality (two to six)Our hunter-gatherer ancestors had very little differentiation when it comes to social rolesThe authors have little inside knowledge of foragers and present a general caveman kind of prehistory and very general ideas of what hunting is likeMany of the roles the authors assign just would not work for egalitarian hunter-gatherersSome of the roles they discuss would not have been viable from an evolutionary perspective (i.e. 4 and 5). What I agree with the authors is their evolutionary approach to personality. Scientists generally find five or six factors (which can be considered roles, or rather the maximum values for each evolutionary profile). However, this is only true in complex societies. In subsistence societies, they typically only find two different factors, e.g. in farmers a conscientious and hard-working profile and a more social and caregiving profile. In Evolutionary Psychology these profiles are called providing and caregiving. A possible evolutionary model based on subsistence strategies would therefore look like this We, therefore, arrive at six evolutionary profiles, each assigned to a maximum value in the HEXACO model (e.g. provisioning pastoralist = highest in extraversion/risk-taking). We could add complex (sedentary) hunter-gatherers compared to nomadic foragers (NJ vs NP) and extraversion/introversion to our model and would get the 16 profiles of MBTI. If we now compare our evolutionary model with the distribution of MBTI types in the enneagram we find some interesting patterns. The distribution for type 3 resembles the distribution of MBTI types most closely and is therefore rather neutral. 1,2 and 6 are totally dominated by SJ (farmer) types. These roles are quite relatable when you picture that ancient farmers had to work hard, slowly improve their farming methods, and generally have high levels of cooperativity and conformity. Nario and Krüger label type 6 (the Loyalist) “the Guardian (the same label Keirsey used for the SJ temperament). This is probably the most common enneagram type and does not represent the forager who keeps watch over the bonfire so much as the farmer who keeps watch over the granary and his property to protect it from being pillaged. Foragers don’t have special guards, they frequently wake during the night, so that at any one point always one member of the band is awake. The last three enneagram types are firmly held by herder types (who make up around 30% of the general population). Explorer, Challenger and Peacekeeper are roles that make sense in nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralist societies that tend to have the highest levels of violence. Peacekeepers are less needed in a conformist farmer society, hence the almost total absence of SJ types. The same is true for Explorers (7s) and Challengers (8s). On the flip side, there are almost no herder 1s or 2s. Farmers and herders lived in very different kinds of worlds, the former seeking stability, the latter adventure. As we can see, farmer world and herder world are almost complementary. It’s the hunter-gatherer types who need to find their purpose in life and fit in. This leaves a lot of hunters with the 5 role (3x overrepresented) and a lot of gatherers (a whopping 50%, almost 5x overrepresented) in the 4 position. Hunters also often side with the farmers in becoming 1s or 3s or with herders in becoming rebels (8s). Gatherers, on the other hand, frequently side with farmers as 2s (Helpers) or with herders as 9s (Peacekeepers). We got a clear farmer world (1,2,6) and a clear herder world (7,8,9) with people who don’t easily fit in occupying 4 and 5 and all the niches in between. My conclusion: the enneagram is unlikely to represent any evolutionary evolved personality profiles. It’s the product of evolved preferences, culture and personal experiences. People aren’t born with an enneagram type like they are born introverts or extroverts. The enneagram shows life trajectories and my hunch is that people can change their enneagram type across their lifespan, whereas introverts hardly can become real extroverts. Nine Sapiens is still a book worth reading, especially for people interested in the enneagram. It’s important to keep in mind that the authors aren’t always dealing with our forager ancestors, though.

I don’t know what happened with your microwave, but I can think of a number of reasons, starting with the electricity that powers it, where there might be a loose connection in the wiring that kept heating up till it caused a fire, and on through a variety of reasons (like putting an aluminum foil pan inside, which would burn.)"},{"instruction":"Why does Transcendental Meditation smell like a scam? Is this trademarked, paid program for real, or are they piggybacking on the general meditation trend?","output":"The Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique was founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and has been taught world-wide since 1957. Without it, it’s unlikely there would be any yoga or new age movement in the United States today. Many of the meditation techniques in today’s marketplace are knock-offs of the TM technique which is rooted in the Vedic texts of 5,000 years ago. The TM technique is taught exclusively by highly trained, teachers certified by a succession of non-profit foundations starting more than 60 years ago. So the TM technique is authentic, scientifically verified, time tested and arguably the most authoritative technique in the field of meditation.

The aspect under scrutiny must furnish some type of pattern. This must be repeatable and quantifiable to be testable with certain rigour. This also ensures the claim has some objective reality, it is subject to the independent scrutiny of others in different forms and expressions. From this pattern, at least one prediction must be made from which the prediction is sought. It must be quantifiable and repeatable. From here, a tentative ‘law of nature' is proposed and further subjected to observation and test. A ‘law' cannot be proved correct, only incorrect. Scientific propositions must be falsifiable. Revision and revolution of thought are welcome, adjusting and integrating with grander schemes of understanding as nature provides new revelations. The context and limitations of application need to be established. The only exemption from this I can think of is the ‘Big Bang' in the creation of the universe. Certainly the evidence suggests this ‘event' with Hubble's law, the Cosmic Microwave Background and the hydrogen to helium ratio seen in the observable universe however this ‘event' (thank God) appears to be beyond our capacity to repeat it. To me, this is science. Much of Psychology and Sociology seeks patterns however human endeavor's are too complex and inextricably interwoven and entangled with chaotic (in the mathematical sense) responses that the uncertainties prevent or make at best uncertain predictions which may often fail. This cannot happen in strict science. We need to be certain of aerodynamics and the classical laws of physics together with a fundamental knowledge of electronics and materials before embarking on a flight or entering the surgeon's operating table. Premises in the social sciences are often more heuristic or empirical in the sense that their adoption is far from the rigorous demand that their suggestion is repeatable and precisely quantifiable. So in this sense I do not see social science as an apt name. Social studies or social behaviour is perhaps closer to a clear description of this discipline."},{"instruction":"w do I get back the rights for my book from a selfpublishing/vanity publishing company like AuthorHouse?","output":"Depending upon the contract, you could have a fight on your hands.

Now go to your Windows Taskbar and at the left type in “cmd.” Press Enter.

However, some of the shrewdest, smartest maneuvers that I've seen in business involve creating a niche market, developing repeat customers and cultivating a loyal customer base. Here are a few examples: 1. Create a niche market - By focusing your business on a specific niche market, you can create a more loyal customer base that is more likely to stay with you through thick and thin. This can be especially beneficial if you're selling a product or service that is difficult to find elsewhere. 2. Develop repeat customers - Once you've built up a small but loyal customer base, it's important to keep them satisfied. This means offering them superior products or services at an affordable price, while also being attentive and responsive to their needs. 3. Cultivate a positive relationship with your customers - Treat your customers well and they will probably return the favor by promoting your business and recommending it to their friends and family members.

These people never follow the demand of the character in a film, they do the same thing in every film. People like the way Shahrukh spread his arms or stutter while speaking a line and he will do this in every film, no matter his character is a cop or a thief. But Sushant is an actor. He started as a background dancer, then he did TV and then films. He worked with director Abhishek Kapoor in his first film as Ishan, an emotional, hardworking and a little stubborn boy who refuses even the financial help of his father. In M.S. Dhoni, Sushant did a wonderful job. He was so much inside the skin of the character that people felt that they are watching the real Dhoni on the big screen. Remember, Dhoni is a popular personality and everyone has seen him several times and thus adopting his body language on the big screen was a real challenge but Sushant did it successfully.

It seems that the current US administration wants to see an end to the EU.","output":"Trump believes in Nationalism. Patriotic duty and love for ones own country. Self determination and the God given right of a people to make its own decisions. He sees the EU as an overreaching entity forcing it views on the populations of Europe. He sees that the people of these nations dont really have a say in there own future. People they didnt vote for, who arent from there country, making decisions for them. They can decide who they send from there little region of their country but thats it. There is something in that that is inherently offensive to the American spirit. We would never let our fate be decided by other countries or entities. Also there is what we see as a negative influence on the West coming out of the EU. A sort of extreme left wing global socialism. Some of the stronger EU nations are pushing a globalist world view on the others. The forced admittance of unscreened migrants and their cultures. The lack of will to regulate or even criticize parts of those cultures that are incompatible with western values. The covering up of crimes by those migrants. Along with the EUs moral inconsistency and hypocrisy. EU citizens get arrested for saying mean words online. Misgendering is a crime. Its governments actively chastise it native citizens on tv, and in movies and advertisements about things like toxic masculinity, lad culture, rape culture, diversity, bigotry, racism, religious tolerance, acceptance of homosexuality and transexuals and a myriad of other “serious\\" issues. Yet allow Muslim no go zones to be set up, sharia police to patrol the streets, forced hijabs in Muslim areas, child brides, assaults of gays and trans, harassment of jewish, Buddhists, and christians at prayer, while also blaming native citizens when sexually assaulted bc they were to revealing in front of men from a different cultures. And what he and many Americans probably see as the biggest problems with the EU is its demonization of its own people for pointing out these problems, and in some cases criminalization, like Tommy Robinson. And worst of all its willingness to see each of it nations individual cultures disappear in favor of globalism. America has already seen some of these concepts which originated in the EU organically migrate to the US. While at the same time having to deal with people like Macron Merkel May etc. openly promoting them to our people. Which has worked to some extent, having gained some traction with a small but very active portion of our society. That is not okay to Trump or the majority of Americans. It is seen as a threat. We believe the social policies enacted by the EU have already caused irreparable harm to your ancient cultures, and if allowed to continue on this path will effectively erase them from everywhere but the history books(until liberals get of hold of them and paint each culture as a violent racist blight on mankind that we are good to be rid of). We dont want to see that happen to you, and we wont let that happen to us. So Trump with the mandate of the American people will work to weaken the EUs control of its member states. Not to break it up, but so each nation can decide its own cultural and social destiny without the interference of Hydra I mean Germany I mean the EU."},{"instruction":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","output":"This 103-year-old woman from Karnataka has grown 384 banyan trees. She is not a book-inspired environmentalist. She did not go to school or get any formal education. She worked as a labourer and like most voiceless Indian women, took life head-on for survival. Thimmakka was born in the Hulikal village in the Magadi taluk of Bangalore Rural district. After doing back-breaking work from dawn to dusk through her childhood, she was married off to Bekal Chikkayya, a cattle herder. The couple were unable to conceive even after 25 years of their marriage, and decided to plant trees and raise them instead. Banyan trees were aplenty near Thimmakka’s village. Thimakka and her husband started grafting saplings from these trees. Ten saplings were grafted in the first year and they were planted along a distance of 4 kilometers near the neighbouring village of Kudoor. Fifteen saplings were planted in the second year and 20 in the third year. She used her own meager resources for planting these trees. The couple used to carry four pails of water for a distance of four kilometers to water the saplings. They were also protected from grazing cattle by fencing them with thorny shrubs. Her husband Chikkayya passed away in 1991. His memories, however, continue to grow and flourish. The saplings they planted together over 50 years ago, majestically line the five-km stretch from Kudur to Hulikal, under the shade of which Thimmakka relaxes and muses. Out of respect for her phenomenal work, locals call her ‘Saalumarada’, meaning row of trees in Kannada. Saalumarada Thimmakka was relatively unknown, until she received the National Citizens Award in 1996. In 2016, Saalumarada Thimmakka was listed by British Broadcasting Corporation as one of the most influential and inspirational women of the world.

Bitcoin alone can handle more than 10,400 transactions per hour, and unlike a stock exchange, cryptocurrency trading is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week — so associated fees can quickly add up. In addition to the volume of cryptocurrency trading, fees vary greatly and currently have no cap. The daily average cost of a Bitcoin transaction has ranged from 1.17 to 10.65 over the last year, before skyrocketing to over 63 in April 2021. How Much Do Crypto Fees Cost? Depending on whether you're a maker (buyer) or taker, most cryptocurrency exchanges charge between 0% and 1.5% per trade (seller). Fees vary depending on the exchange. You'll never be able to completely avoid cryptocurrency transaction fees, but you can use services with lower fee structures. If you trade frequently in the cryptocurrency market, these fees can quickly add up. Robinhood, eToro, ShakePay, and BlockFi are all fee-free options. For both Makers and Takers, exchanges such as BitMEX and FTX charge transaction fees of less than 0.1%. However, as previously stated, every trading service will profit from your cryptocurrency orders.

While numerous platforms offer SEO solutions, this article aims to provide valuable tips that can be universally applied, irrespective of any specific platform. By implementing these proven strategies, you can improve your SERP ranking and attract more visitors to your website. Comprehensive Keyword Research Effective keyword research is the foundation of successful SEO. Start by identifying relevant keywords and phrases that align with your content and target audience.

Incorporate these keywords naturally into your website's content, meta tags, headings, and URLs to help search engines understand the purpose of your pages. High-Quality Content Creation Producing valuable, engaging, and unique content is essential for achieving higher SERP rankings. Craft well-written articles, blog posts, and web pages that provide informative solutions to your audience's queries. Strive for comprehensive, long-form content that thoroughly covers a topic. Ensure your content is well-structured, incorporates relevant keywords, and includes visual elements such as images and videos to enhance user experience. On-Page Optimization Optimizing your website's on-page elements helps search engines understand its relevance. Ensure your website has clear and descriptive title tags, meta descriptions, and headers that incorporate targeted keywords. Make sure your website is mobile-friendly, loads quickly, and has a user-friendly interface.

Are Macedonians Greek (not North Macedonia)?","output":"I’ve answered similar questions, one can check them for details but here it is again. Ancient Macedonia was a part of Greece, at least politically and ethnically. As Strabo (64 BC- 24 BC) wrote in his book Geography: Macedonia, of course, is a part of Greece, yet now, since I am following the nature and shape of the places geographically, I have decided to classify it apart from the rest of Greece and to join it with that part of Thrace which borders on it and extends as far as the mouth of the Euxine In another passage Strabo says that north of the Aegean it’s still Greece and he describes this part as Macedonia: The Aegaean Sea washes Greece on two sides: first, the side that faces towards the east and stretches from Sunium, towards the north as far as the Thermaean Gulf and Thessaloniceia, a Macedonian city, which at the present time is more populous than any of the rest; and secondly, the side that faces towards the south, I mean the Macedonian country, extending from Thessaloniceia as far as the Strymon. Some, however, also assign to Macedonia the country that extends from the Strymon as far as the Nestus River, since Philip was so specially interested in these districts that he appropriated them to himself This is in line with what Xenophon reported from around 400 BC when an ambassador is describing a war between Olynthus and other states in the region: a great danger is springing up in Greece. To be sure, almost all of you know that Olynthus is the largest of the cities on the coast of Thrace. These Olynthians, in the first place, attached to themselves some of the cities with the provision that all should live under the same laws and be fellow-citizens, and then they took over some of the larger cities also. After this they undertook, further, to free the cities of Macedonia from Amyntas, king of the Macedonians. And when the nearest of them gave their allegiance, they speedily proceeded against those which were farther away and larger; and we left them already in possession of a great number of Macedonian cities, including especially Pella So, Macedonia and the part of Thrace that had Greek states is called Greece because politically that’s what it was. Not in the modern sense of nation-states but as the collection of Greek states. Arrian in his “Anabasis of Alexander” mentions a letter Alexander wrote when he started his camapign against the Persian campaign: Alexander wrote a reply, and sent Thersippus with the men who had come from Darius, with instructions to give the letter to Darius, but not to converse about anything. Alexander’s letter ran thus: “Your ancestors came into Macedonia and the rest of Greece and treated us ill, without any previous injury from us. I, having been appointed commander-in-chief of the Greeks, and wishing to take revenge on the Persians, crossed over into Asia And then, after the Battle of Granicus Arrian writes: prisoners he bound in fetters and sent them away to Macedonia to till the soil, because, though they were Greeks, they were fighting against Greece on behalf of the foreigners in opposition to the decrees which the Greeks had made in their federal council. The battle was fought in Anatolia, yet because the Persians and their Greek mercenaries were fighting against Alexander and the council of Corinth they essentially fought against Greece. As for modern Macedonians from Macedonia, not “North Macedonia”, they are of course Greeks as it’s a province of Greece, a country greatly homogeneous ethnically. Of course, alongside the hundreds of thousands of Greek Macedonians up to the 1920s there were Bulgarian and Turkish populations in the region but they were exchanged with Greeks under the treaties of Neilly and Lausane respectively. I’ve lived several years in Macedonia and all the locals I met were Greek, although to be honest I didn’t spend much time at the border villages next to North Macedonia where there are some few Slavic Makedonski. As far as I know these too have mized a lot as I’ve met a girl whose grandma from a village of Florina was Slavic Macedonian but the other grandma and both grandparent were Greek speaking, well, Greeeks. In any case, that’s an exception because it was a brief walk from North Macedonia. A few thousands in some villages are a tiny minority compared to the more than 2 milions of Macedonin Greeks. If one wishes to check, it is always a nice place to visit any time of the year. One can go to the stadium and listen to how people swear. Or some cafe, some bar and listen to the chats. Pick a good spot and do some ethnography.

In this discussion, we will explore various aspects of investing in cryptocurrencies to help you make an informed decision. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others, have gained significant attention over the past decade. They offer an alternative to traditional financial systems and promise decentralization, security, and potential for high returns. However, these digital assets come with unique challenges that should be carefully considered. First and foremost, the cryptocurrency market is highly speculative and volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, leading to substantial gains or losses. It is not uncommon to witness rapid price swings, which can be both exciting and unnerving for investors. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #nSCNt] One of the key drivers of cryptocurrency prices is market sentiment, which can be influenced by news, regulatory developments, or technological advancements. Therefore, understanding the underlying factors impacting the market is crucial in managing your investments effectively. Another consideration is the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency space. While some countries have implemented regulatory frameworks, many are still developing their approach. This absence of regulation can lead to potential risks, such as scams, fraud, and market manipulation. As an investor, it's essential to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before participating in any investment opportunities. Despite the risks, some proponents argue that cryptocurrencies offer diversification benefits to traditional investment portfolios. Historically, cryptocurrencies have shown a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which means they may provide an additional hedge against economic downturns. Moreover, blockchain technology, which underlies most cryptocurrencies, has shown potential in various industries beyond finance, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and voting systems. Investing in cryptocurrencies can be seen as a way to support and participate in the development of these technologies. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has also brought new opportunities to the cryptocurrency space. DeFi platforms enable individuals to access financial services without intermediaries, while NFTs allow for unique ownership of digital assets. These innovations have attracted considerable interest and investment in recent times. Diversification, technological potential, and the excitement of cutting-edge developments aside, investing in cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks. As a relatively new and evolving asset class, their long-term sustainability is uncertain. Market sentiment and regulatory changes can lead to abrupt price movements, impacting even the most established cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency ecosystem faces technical challenges, such as scalability and security issues. Blockchain networks need to address these concerns to ensure broader adoption and stability. In light of these considerations, it is crucial to approach cryptocurrency investing with a balanced perspective. Only invest what you can afford to lose and be prepared for a bumpy ride. To mitigate risks, consider diversifying your investment across multiple cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Additionally, educate yourself about the underlying technology, market trends, and potential risks. Staying informed and up-to-date with the latest developments in the cryptocurrency space is essential for making well-informed decisions. Seeking advice from financial professionals with experience in cryptocurrencies can also be beneficial. They can offer personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation and risk tolerance. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #vzivl] In conclusion, investing in cryptocurrencies can be worthwhile for some, but it's not without risks. The potential for high returns and technological innovations attracts many investors, but the volatile nature of the market requires caution and thorough research. Whether you decide to invest in cryptocurrencies or not, understanding the risks and potential rewards is crucial for making sound financial decisions.

But to understand why they are wrong one has to understand death statistics of India. India has 8.5–9 million deaths every year. When I first realised the size of this number I was zapped — so MANY people normally die every year. Over the last decade our death rate has been falling but our population including the aged population has been rising, approximately cancelling each other out. So as our population rises, one gets more deaths but because of gains in health care, the death rate has fallen and therefore the total number of deaths in the country has more or less held steady. So the 8.5 to 9 million number has stayed steady for a couple of decades. Every death in India doesnt get recorded. As can be seen in the write up quoted below, around a third of the deaths in India go unrecorded but as record keeping improves, this fraction has fallen to about 15-20% of deaths going unrecorded. The primary reason to get a death certificate is for property transfer, so only the destitute people in villages are cremated without death certificate. Even if a person doesn’t own property, the other relatives would need proof of death so that complex title deeds of agricultural property can get updated. [LINKED_TEXT: Data: How many Deaths are recorded in India every year?Deaths due to COVID-19 crossed 9000 mark recently.There are apprehensions about this reported number.What does data about recorded deaths in India tell ushttps://factly.in/data-how-many-deaths-are-recorded-in-india-every-year/] [URL: https://factly.in/data-how-many-deaths-are-recorded-in-india-every-year/]So deaths in villages need to be recorded for property ownership related reasons, even if the cremation is done in a field somewhere, piled with logs of wood. Whereas in cities, the destitute population is much higher but city crematoria require death certificate before they will accept for cremation and there is really no way to cremate a body in a big city without getting into trouble. So one should assume that the 20% unrecorded is the most likely number of unregistered deaths - the more we try to get data, the more accurate it gets and for 2020 we have got the most accurate records of all. So the unrecorded number is probably much lesser than 20%, likely less than 10%. Almost all the WHO estimates of excess deaths in India are supposed to be for 2021 when we had the lethal delta wave. The official estimate is 500,000+ total deaths. Of this 500,000, lets say 400,000 deaths were in 2021. That means 5% of total deaths in India (which is 8.5 to 9 million) were due to Covid. Notice that it is a small number - 5%. Cardiovascular disease is 30%, other infections like TB is 10%, the detailed pie chart is there in the quoted write ups. That part of the pie chart is is not going to change — same number of people are going to die of other causes as before, that's natural death. So for Covid death rate to rise to 4.7 million, total number of deaths has to be almost one and a half times higher than the usual 8.5 to 9 million. But total number of deaths in 2021 is not currently available. What is available is total number of deaths in 2020 which is 8.1 million. This is actually the registered number of deaths because of extra effort made by the Govt to get most of the deaths registered. Estimated deaths would be 9–10 million. In 2019 some 7.6 million deaths were registered. In 2018, 6.9 million were registered, 6.4 million in 2017 and 5.8 to 6.3 million deaths from 2007 to 2017 with about 100,000 rise each year. The rising trend of registered deaths is not because more people were dying in those years but clearly due to improved record keeping. Also, it is related to improved data transmission - because the deaths are always registered in the local place but because of lack of data compilation, they would not be collated and analysed. Now with computerization and internet they are more accessible for compilation [LINKED_TEXT: Explained: The death data in CRS, and why they do not tell the full story of India’s Covid-19 tollThere has been unusually high interest in the CRS data for 2020, especially the death numbers contained therein, because of the large number of deaths caused by the pandemic. About 1.49 lakh people died due to Covid-19 in 2020, according to official figures.https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-death-data-2020-coronavirus-7901020/] [URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-death-data-2020-coronavirus-7901020/]Clearly the death data has started to improve in the last few years, estimates however remain the same i.e. 8.5 - 9 million die each year. Govt says there were 140,000 deaths in 2020 due to Covid. Given the amount of Covid spread, that seems pretty believable to me. There were really no widespread reports of people dying in villages. We had a lockdown that for the most part prevented transmission and also the heightened sensitivity of people and Covid fear ensured that most Covid cases did get recorded. I would say maybe 150,000 Covid deaths in 2020 is all one should interpolate for lack of registration. Deaths in 2020 is just a tiny fraction of what WHO claims for India (4.7 million) The vast bulk of 4.7 million deaths in India projected by WHO would therefore have to come from 2021. The govt says close to 400,000 died of Covid in 2021. WHO estimates it 10 times higher at 4.5 million deaths. To know that for sure, we would need to see how many people died in 2021 in total. And that information is not yet available. Estimates for death rate in 2021 is 7.3% based on a projection, since actual data is not available. [LINKED_TEXT: India Death Rate 1950-2023Chart and table of the India death rate from 1950 to 2023. United Nations projections are also included through the year 2100.https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/death-rate] [URL: https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/death-rate]Calculating from that 7.3%, the number of deaths in India should be 10 million in 2021 (and another 10 million also in 2020 using same source). To say that there were excess deaths in India from Covid, we would need to see about 13–14 million deaths in India in the year 2021. The truth or lie of the WHO report would therefore require data on the actual numbers of registered death numbers that come out for 2021. If that number is less than 10 million, then WHO is way wrong in its calculations. Because 8–10 million people anyway die in India every year. Suddenly cannot have only half the expected number dying of usual causes just to say they died of covid to bolster inaccurate projections of WHO I think that in most Indian villages affected by Covid, based on a few conversations and hearsay, some 1-2 people died. But not every village got Covid. Since there are 650,000 odd villages in India, I guess estimate that around 1 million people AT MOST could have died due to Covid. More than the govt’s 400,000 but less than the WHO’s 4.7 million. And if it is a million deaths, then it will be just 10% of the country’s 10 million deaths and would be just a data blip that would be difficult to prove. But WHO claim of 4.7 million would really really stand out in the 2021 data and cannot be hidden. Thats a 50% jump in our country’s mortality. There can be little doubt that WHO is wildly wrong. There is no evidence presented by any of the papers cited by WHO that there were 14 million total deaths in India. That much number people would notice. We all live here and we know that didn't happen."},{"instruction":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","output":"To sum it up in a one liner - capitalism®. The current system isn’t progress-oriented, but rather interest or profit oriented. There’s an example I always like to mention: there’s a device that fits your hand like a glove and measures and records the impulses your muscles make when you move your hand around. It then converts the recordings from specific movements into signals that are used to control all sorts of devices wirelessly. You can control stuff such as drones, appliances and even heavy machinery just by moving your hand. The catch? It costs a mere 1000. If this kind of technology were distributed equally, the accessibility to new technology would accelerate our potential to invent and progress exponentially; yeah, sure we have more groundbreaking innovations right now, but even those technologies (or at least the high quality stuff) are available to those who can afford them. Hell, scientific articles cost if you want to read about the latest discoveries in top notch magazines such as Nature™ or Cell™. You want to know what kind of new discoveries have been made in cancer therapies? Pay ~30 to read about it, see that the therapy usually costs almost as much as a kidney on the market, and if you have the , go get the good stuff. If you do not, go get a cheaper version, most often ‘recommended’ by the doctors in state hospitals and probably die from the side effects."},{"instruction":"The Mahabhar","output":"To be very honest, even the heros of Mahabharat were humans like us. There were not characters who ran on an AI based brains. If archery skill is concerned: Bhishma, Arjun, Karna, Abhimanyu, Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, Bhagadatta & Bheem were all almost equal. To support my answer, here are some waring incidences: Arjun can be called the greatest warrior because he single handedly dominated the Virat war (last day of Agyatvas). His foes included Karna, Bhishma, Ashwatthama, Duryodhan, Shakuni etc. Yet Arjun faced difficulty while slaying Bhishma, Drona, Karna & Bhagadatta. He killed the four by means of Krishna’s tricks. Also Bhagadatta had defeated Arjun during the Ashwamedh yagya of Indraprastha after fighting a 21 days of battle with him.Abhimanyu. Throught the first 12 days of Kurukshetra war, Abhimanyu stayed undefeated. Not a single Kuru warrior could defeat Abhimanyu. Although in few occasions Abhimanyu had to fall back (day 2 Abhimanyu vs Bhishma battle. But this does not prove Bhishma stronger than Abhimanyu as Bhishma had to fall back against him on day 1) (day 8 Abhimanyu & Bheem both could not defeat Bhagadatta alone until Arjun joined them). On day 13 Abhimanyu defeated every single warrior in the Chakravyuh and the kauravas had to break the war rules to brutally murder him. In the Chakravyuh, Abhimanyu had defeated Karna 3 times.Bhishma. He stayed undefeated till the very last moment when he dropped his weapons after seeing Shikhandi. Bhishma had defeated Lord Parshuram during his young days. This in itself proves how divinely powerful he must be. Although there were certain occasions when Bhishma had to retreat while facing Arjun, Abhimanyu, Satyaki, Bheem. This proves that every fighter was a human who got tired & who made mistakes.Karna. Karna could could not save Duryodhan from the Gandharva. It was Arjun who saved him. Also karna failed against Arjun during Virat war. But on day 16 & 17 of Kurukshetra war Karna used his divine Vijay bow. Lord Parshuram had blessed him that he wont face a defeat unless and untill he had this bow in hand. And so Karna dominated Arjun. On these two days Karna was definitely stronger than Arjun. But destiny was to be blamed and Arjun beheaded him while he was unarmed. Not to forget that without his celestial Vijay bow he faced defeat to Abhimanyu on day 13 & without Vijay bow he was defeated by Bheem on day 17. (Karna used his vijay bow only while fighting Arjun)Ashwatthama. On day 15 evening Ashwatthama was invincible. He invoked some of the most dreadful astras namely Narayan astra, Agneya astra, etc and created havoc in the pandav army. Not a single Pandav warrior could face the wrath of Ashwatthama that day.Dronacharya. The teacher of all! Yudhisthir had to lie to his Dharma to slay this noble soul. This tells how strong Drona must be. On day 4 Drona defeated Satyaki with such ease! Satyaki had once attacked Bhishma with such brutality that even the mighty Pitahmah had to take cover from Alambush.Ghatotkach. How can we forget the might son of Bheem! The last and only resort to slay him was Karna’s Vasavi Shakti weapon. Wonder what might happen if Karns had not got this weapon under his arsenals. Ghatotkach was singly battling against Karna, Ashwatthama, Duryodhan, Shakuni & Kripacharya and yet dominated them all at once.Bheem! The strongest of all if strength is considered. Not just with the mace but with his Vayavya bow he was a great archer too! On day 17 Bheem had defeated Karna in bow fight. Karna fell onto his chariot unconscious! But not to forget he was also defeated by Karna on day 14. Karna did not kill Bheem because of his promise given to Kunti. Bheem faced defeats from Bhishma, Drona & Bhagadatta as well. hence to conclude, I will say, truth & Dharma were the strongest warriors! Good always prevails over Evil."},{"instruction":"What are the disadvantages a person can have after becoming a member of a Freemason?","output":"Other than time there isn't one, as far as I'm concerned.

What do I do?","output":"\\"If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you.\\" ― Fred DeVito Focus on Compound Weightlifting Exercises To increase performance, strength, and size, these four exercises are on top of the list. Bench PressSquatDeadliftMilitary Press All these are compound exercises, meaning they all work multiple joints and muscle groups when performed. For example, the bench press activates the muscle groups in the chest, triceps, and shoulders. What Makes These Exercises The Best These exercises work multiple muscle groups in the body, hence increasing the efficiency in your workouts. To maximize your full body potential, you should aim to target the biggest muscle group in the body which is the gluteus maximus. This is also commonly known as glutes that contain three muscles in the back of each hip. Why You Should Lift Weights Lifting weights is a form of exercise that helps with fat metabolism. But if new to strength training, you will be able to gain muscle rapidly and lose fat at the same time. However, once your body adapts to the initial change, it will take more time to gain muscle by lifting heavier weights. Along with proper recovery and nutrition, weightlifting enables the body to build muscle. By lifting heavy weights that your body has not adapted to, it essentially breaks down the muscle tissue in that particular body part. Besides burning more fat and building the physique that you want, lifting weights also: Promote anabolic hormones (growth hormones and testosterone) production.Help keep the muscle that you already have.Increase your basal metabolic rate by having more muscles in the body.Decrease the level of cortisol, the stress hormone in the body. The Benefits of Testosterone Studies have shown having higher testosterone levels can subdue fat cells creation while having lower testosterone levels can promote fat creation and obesity. This is especially important if you have a higher level of fat because it's generally associated with having lower testosterone level. Because of the inverse relationship between testosterone and cortisol leve[LINKED_TEXT: l] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8884416], you should do exercises that maximize testosterone production. You produce testosterone naturally because it’s the most important male sex hormone.[1] 270 to 1070 ng/dL[2] is the range of testosterone level in men according to the book Androgens and the Aging Male by Stephen J. Winters and Ilpo T. Huhtaniemithe. How to Perform Compound Exercises Please consult with your physician to decide if you're physically suited to do these exercises. Injuries can occur with these exercises, so do them at your own risk. Use the steps below as mere guidelines if you're performing these exercises for the first time to prevent potential injuries. Listen to your body, especially if you have pain from previous or lingering injuries. Warm up each exercise with just body weight or very light weights.Then do the exercise with just the barbell.Slowly increase the weights on the barbell with 10 pounds (5-pound plates on each side) increments to find your target weight.Find a target weight that you can do 4 to 6 repetitions (70 to 85 percent of your 1 maximum repetition) to maximize strength with optimal volume.Rest 3 to 4 minutes in between each set (I usually do 3 sets) for optimal reproducibility. Depending on your goal, you may be content with your current lift weight. But if you are looking to get stronger, you will have to slowly increase your lift weight while staying within the 4 to 6 repetition range. Closing Thoughts The squats, deadlifts, bench press, and military press are the top four compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups in the body, including the biggest muscle gluteus maximus. To build strength for a particular part of the body, you may have to do isolation exercises such as bicep curls for your biceps. The one hour of exercise is only a small part of the equation in building a strong muscular body. The other 23 hours of recovery time along with proper nutrients for the body to replenish and grow are way more important! Whatever your goal is with strength training, remember that there are compromises along the way such as having too much muscle can limit flexibility in the body. Be aware of your goal in strength training because having too much muscle mass can be disadvantageous. Ultimately you want to build a body uniquely catered to your goals. Because I run, cycle, rock climb, and swim, I don't want too much muscle because that will hinder my recreational goals. Now I perform strength training with the sole purpose of maintenance.

To become a skilled writer, you ought to be a good reader. Being a creative writer is synonymous with being a good reader. To improve your skills in writing, you have to read fruitful books. You might not realize at first but what you read will indirectly make an impact in your use of words, sentence construction, vocabulary, use of punctuation, imaginative skills, just to mention a few. 2. You have to face the fear of rejection and criticism Most writers have grown a tough skin towards readers’ criticism of their works. They have also seen rejection as a pathway to success. To become a successful writer, you have to accept that your manuscript might be rejected a couple of times and readers might say unpleasant words about your works. How do you react? Learn from these and ensure that it improves your writing skills. 3. Network and socialize with other writers With the advent of social media, it has become easier to join groups with people that share similar interests with you. Surprisingly, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Quora…and even WhatsApp, are great platforms to connect with other writers and share your write-ups. 4. Remember to never give up While you’re trying to perfect your draft and you keep writing and editing, remember to never give up. No writer had their first draft right. They kept writing, re-writing and editing. Never forget that! 5. There’s ‘money’ in writing Do you intend to become a professional writer and you believe you have what it takes to become one? Start perfecting your skill in writing. Apply for freelance writing jobs, register for online writing skills and read fruitful books. Best-selling authors like Stephen King, Paulo Coehlo, and J.K Rowling were discouraged at the beginning of their writing career. They never gave up and look at where they are today!

These mistakes are: 1. Not making time table- Students who are not making time table are committing a big mistake, they all are preparing but they don’t have a path on which they have to go. Time table helps you to give a path to reach the goal that is clearing GATE exam. You do have to make time table in which you have to set deadlines for each topics. These deadline will give you a little pressure which will ultimately help you in boosting you efficiency. 2. Not being Consistency- Many students are studying but not on regular basis or they haven’t fixed the time for their studies. You have to study daily. You have to stick to your time table. You may feel not to study on a day or two. But you have to study regularly and keep hustling until your exam date. Consistency is the key to success. Many students fails to crack GATE exam because they aren’t consistent. Don’t commit the same mistakes like other by not being consistent. 3. Referring to many materials- If you’re referring too many materials then you are doing a blunder mistake. Referring too many material will ultimately waste your time and energy. You don’t have time to waste. Whatever time you have got for your preparation, you have to utilize it properly. There are many materials that are available for GATE preparation. You have to choose any one best material for you preparation. I would recommend Notes4u(.in) material for GATE. I found it best and it do cover whole syllabus of GATE. You all can consider it. 4. Not giving mocks- Students usually wait for completing their syllabus and then give a mock test. But I would say it is wrong thing to do. You have to give mocks even if you haven’t completed your syllabus. Mock test helps in improving yourself. Through writing mock test, you will be able to identify your mistakes. You have to avoid committing those mistakes in future mocks. Instead of committing same mistake, commit new mistakes. Every mistake give you a chance to improve. You can analyse your performance through mock test. So, it is must to give mock test. Try to give at least 50 mocks test before actual examination of GATE. Try not to commit these mistakes that are stated above. If you are successful in not committing these mistakes then you will be ahead of other aspirants.

(even though in south Korea it’s like you’re in a gang or something)"},{"instruction":"Mathematicians, how did you become so exceptionally great at maths? Please what are the secrets to understanding high school and college mathematics?","output":"I would not call myself exceptionally great. I have better math intuition and training than the majority of engineers. This allows me to build some very cool and advanced pieces of software. But I surely am not on the theoretical mathematics level of pure math geniuses. The secret to my greatness is first studying engineering mathematics in university in a typical M.Sc. degree and to then do lots of practice with linear algebra in Matlab or Octave. At least one hour every day for 5,10, almost 15 years now. And suddenly I can come up with and do 10–100 things on the level of engineering professors."},{"instruction":"Iraq better off today than it would have been still under Saddam?","output":"Yes it is better off today <3 …we can afford the latest iPhone and expensive stuff and ship them from all over the world here, before 2003 we were under a severe trade embargo and our currency was very weak, conscription meant that every young man had to waste at least 2 years of his life on “service” to a madman, i could go on and on, but you guys can see a glimpse of the full picture…"},{"instruction":"f you quit Quora, do you think anyone would miss you?","output":"I joined Quora on December 7, 2019. That was just 3 weeks ago. In those 3 weeks I’ve had over 77,5000 views on my answers, over 2,000 upvotes on just 321 answers, with 16 total shares as of today December 29, 2019. I poured my mind out onto the internet. I tried to provide people with in depth answers that I hope will be useful to somebody, somewhere, sometime. I’m not great at math, but I think that’s 523% more upvotes, than I have answers in 3 weeks time. Granted, the majority of the votes were on several specific posts. So the question is if I left today, do I think someone would miss me? I don’t know. I do hope that someone would remember me and the interesting way in which I respond to questions. While I’m sure there are plenty of people out there like me, It would be nice to know that someone enjoyed being able to read what was going on in my mind. Again, I do this in hopes that something I say will inspire, or help somebody. I do it for the love of my fellow humans."},{"instruction":"VLAD Tepes (Dracula) Romanian or Hungarian?","output":"Well, I’d say neither.

Then I’d start wondering how well I could hide the body…while I struggled not to puke my guts out. It’s not political (or not too much), it’s just that I find her personality to be incredibly abrasive, and physically she’s about as unappealing as a female can get.

Their primary function is to connect the gap between business requirements and technology solutions. The key responsibilities of a business analyst include: Requirements Gathering: Business analysts work closely with stakeholders, including clients, business users, and technical teams, to elicit, document, and analyze requirements. Their task is to identify the needs, goals, and constraints of the project or system and ensure that all relevant information is collected. Process Analysis: They assess existing business processes and workflows to understand their operations and identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas for optimization. Techniques such as process mapping and modeling are used to visualize and document the current and future state of processes. Solution Design: Business analysts collaborate with stakeholders and development teams to design appropriate solutions based on requirements and analysis. They help define functional and non-functional specifications, create prototypes or wireframes, and assist in making technology and architecture decisions. Documentation: Business analysts are responsible for creating comprehensive and accurate documentation throughout the project lifecycle. This includes writing business requirements documents (BRDs), functional specifications, use cases, user stories, process flow diagrams, and other relevant artifacts. Stakeholder Management: They act as a liaison between different stakeholders, facilitating effective communication and understanding between business users, project managers, developers, and other team members. They ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of requirements and project goals. Data Analysis: Business analysts may also be involved in analyzing data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions. They may work with databases, conduct data mining, or use statistical techniques to interpret and present findings. Change Management: Business analysts help manage the impact of change within an organization. They identify potential risks and obstacles and develop strategies for the successful implementation of new processes or systems. They may also assist in training and providing support to users during the transition. Quality Assurance: They collaborate with testing teams to define test cases and validate that the implemented solution meets the defined requirements. They participate in user acceptance testing (UAT) and ensure that the solution meets the business needs and objectives. Continuous Improvement: Business analysts actively seek opportunities to improve business processes and systems. They stay updated on industry trends, emerging technologies, and best practices to provide innovative solutions and enhance operational efficiency. It is imperative to note that the specific responsibilities of a business analyst can vary depending on the organization, industry, and project requirements.
