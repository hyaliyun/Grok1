Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files. Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD, then reimporting would create music files without the DRM.

The most common symptom of LED (and diode laser) failure is the gradual lowering of light output and loss of efficiency. Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur.

With the development of highpower LEDs the devices are subjected to higher junction temperatures and higher current densities than traditional devices. This causes stress on the material and may cause early lightoutput degradation. To quantitatively classify useful lifetime in a standardized manner it has been suggested to use L70 or L50, which are the runtimes (typically given in thousands of hours) at which a given LED reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively.

Veteran airline pilot: Planes don't fly themselves. Capt. Chesley Sullenberger: Autopilot slightly hindered emergency Hudson River landing. Aviation/human automation expert: Remotecontrol airliners may be 2 generations away.","output":"Autopilot is a technology that is often misunderstood by passengers. The myths surrounding autopilot can cause confusion, and it is important to understand that planes do not fly themselves. This is according to a veteran airline pilot who has years of experience in the aviation industry. The pilot also points out that even though autopilot can be a helpful tool in certain situations, it does not take away the need for a human pilot to be in control of the airplane. In fact, during an emergency landing on the Hudson River, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger has stated that autopilot slightly hindered the landing. This is a clear indication that even in emergency situations, the human pilot is needed to make important decisions. An expert in aviation and human automation has also mentioned that it may be two generations away before remote-control airliners become a reality. This means that passengers can rest assured that their flight is being controlled by a human pilot who has extensive training and expertise in flying. It is important to dispel the myths surrounding autopilot and understand that it is just a technology that assists the pilot in flying the plane. The human pilot remains in control at all times, making important decisions and ensuring the safety of all passengers on board.

Therefore, it is difficult to give a definitive answer to this question. However, by looking at some historical data, we can gain insight into how much longer the longest running touchdown has been compared to the shortest. According to the NFL's statistical database, the longest running touchdown in the league's history was scored by Tony Dorsett of the Dallas Cowboys on January 3, 1983. In a game against the Minnesota Vikings, Dorsett broke free for a 99-yard touchdown run. On the other hand, the shortest touchdown runs in NFL history have all been one-yard plunges by running backs who have taken the ball over the goal line from the one-yard line. So, we can conclude that the difference between the longest and shortest running touchdown is generally around 98 yards (99 minus 1). However, it's important to note that there have been many touchdowns scored in between these two extremes. Running backs and other players who carry the ball into the end zone have found success from all distances.

Recheck your pulse after you’ve been moderately active.","output":"Pulse checking: A quick and easy way to assess your overall health One of the easiest and most accessible ways to check the health of your heart and circulatory system is to monitor your pulse. By placing your fingers on the inside of your wrist, you can feel your pulse and get an idea of how fast your heart is beating. This simple technique can be useful not only for people with heart conditions but for everyone who wants to take care of their overall health. To check your pulse, place the tips of your index and middle fingers on the inside of your wrist, just below the base of your thumb. Apply gentle pressure until you feel a pulsation. Count the number of beats you feel in 15 seconds, then multiply that number by 4 to get your heart rate per minute. A healthy resting heart rate for adults is generally between 60 and 100 beats per minute, but it can vary depending on factors such as age, fitness level, and medications. After measuring your resting heart rate, try to perform some light to moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking or cycling, for about 10 minutes. Then recheck your pulse and note any changes. A healthy heart will typically respond to moderate physical activity by increasing its rate, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to the muscles and organs that need them. Monitoring your pulse regularly can be a powerful tool for detecting early signs of heart problems, such as arrhythmias, tachycardia, or bradycardia. If you notice a consistently high or low resting heart rate, or if your heart rate doesn't increase as expected during physical activity, you should consult your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional. Pulse checking is also a useful way to track your fitness progress and adjust your exercise routine accordingly. By increasing your cardiovascular fitness, you can lower your resting heart rate and improve your overall health and well-being. In summary, checking your pulse is a quick, easy, and affordable way to assess your heart health and monitor your fitness progress. By making it a regular habit, you can improve your cardiovascular fitness, prevent heart problems, and lead a healthier and more active life."},{"instruction":"Great service at the bar!

One of the things you can draw is an airplane. Whether you’re an artist or just starting to learn, this guide can help you draw an airplane with ease. Start by drawing a long curved shape. This shape will serve as the belly of the airplane. Next, draw an inverted version of the first curve on top to connect the ends of the curves, producing a rough outline of the airplane’s body. After drawing the airplane's body, you can proceed to sketching its wings. Draw a slanted rectangle on each side of the airplane’s body to serve as the wings. Make sure that the wings' size and shape are proportional to the airplane's body. Now that you have drawn the airplane's body and wings, it’s time to add the stabilizer. Draw a quadrilateral shape on the rear part of the plane, which will serve as the horizontal and vertical stabilizer. Once you’ve added the stabilizer, remove unnecessary lines from your outline. Erase the parts of the airplane’s body and wings that are not needed for the final drawing. Next, draw curved lines beneath the wings for the engine. You can use your creativity to add more details to your airplane drawing, like windows and doors. Finally, color your drawing and add clouds or other planes for some details. You can use different colors that you like to make your airplane drawing more fun and colorful. Drawing can be a great way to unwind and relax.

It's natural to feel annoyed and question why this person is imitating you. However, before you jump to conclusions, it's important to consider why they are copying you. Are they doing it intentionally to irritate you, or are they doing it unconsciously? Once you have an idea of their motives, it's essential to approach the topic subtly. Chance is that the person copying you doesn't realise that they are doing it, and it's equally not likely that they will respond well if they feel publicly called out. As such, it's best to keep conversations surrounding the matter private and allow them to save face. Consider changing your style or mannerisms. If the person copying you is doing it intentionally, changing up your behaviour can discourage further imitation. Still, it's important to assess your reasons for making changes. You may love your styling and mannerisms, and it's essential to remember that you should not have to change something you like because someone else is mimicking it. It's crucial to treat the person the way you want to be treated. Remember that imitation is often a form of flattery, so take the situation as such. A little empathy can go a long way. It would be best to avoid confrontation, accusations or rudeness in how you deal with the situation. Lastly, offer help to the person copying you at school or in the office. It's just possible that they admire your style and mannerisms, and they're looking for guidance or advice from you. Empathy and kindness can allow an opportunity for you to bond bond over your shared taste and find new ways to build on them. In conclusion, dealing with someone imitating you can be confronting, but how you handle the situation will determine the outcome.

A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearancebased taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group).

However, a CNN investigation discovered that FEMA actually gave away these supplies as government surplus rather than utilizing them in disaster relief efforts. The revelation has caused outrage among critics, who argue that the supplies could have been put to better use in communities affected by natural disasters. In response, FEMA Administrator has defended the agency's decision to give away the items, stating that the supplies were no longer needed for emergency management operations, and it was more cost-effective to donate them. While FEMA's rationale may be logical, many people find it hard to accept that such a significant amount of supplies could have been wasted in this manner. In an era where natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires are causing increasing destruction across the United States, it's essential that all resources be used prudently in relief efforts. Given the increasing frequency of natural disasters across the United States, it's crucial that FEMA reviews its disaster relief model and prioritizes efficient and effective use of its resources to help communities in need. FEMA must also enhance its coordination with state and local agencies to ensure that they are meeting people's most pressing needs in times of disaster. In conclusion, while some of the 85 million in supplies given away by FEMA may have been surplus, it's essential that such resources be used prudently in disaster relief efforts.

Now her lawyer is claiming that another jail term would be dangerous for her physical and mental health. The County Antrim bombing was a horrendous attack that caused a great deal of damage and harm.

She is likely to have greater medical needs than younger inmates. Ultimately, it is up to the judge to decide what the appropriate punishment for Ms. McGlinchey should be.

The demonstrations have led to a lockdown of the government district where Putin is expected to meet with Indian officials. Despite the ongoing protests, the Indian government has welcomed Putin to the country in hopes of strengthening economic and political ties between the two nations. The visit will mark Putin's second trip to India since 2018, and comes as the two countries continue to work towards greater cooperation on issues such as defense, energy, and trade. However, with tensions running high in New Delhi, Putin's visit is likely to be met with cautious optimism. While the Russian President has praised India's efforts to promote economic growth and regional stability, many in India are calling for a stronger and more decisive response to the issues that have led to the current unrest. As Putin meets with Indian officials and business leaders, it remains to be seen whether his visit will help to alleviate tensions in the capital city, or whether it will further inflame the situation. In this uncertain climate, it is clear that India is facing significant challenges as it seeks to balance its economic and political priorities with the demands of its citizens for justice and accountability."},{"instruction":"There are perhaps three hundred sign languages in use around the world today.

In Surrey, the recent theft of 600 signs has cost the council a hefty expense of £23,000 for their replacement. However, the consequences of this nuisance extend beyond the financial losses. During floods, the absence of signs indicating the submerged areas can be catastrophic as it leads many drivers to drive into these areas, unaware of the danger. Recently, several motorists have suffered this fate, causing damage to their vehicles and putting their lives at risk. It is imperative to address this issue promptly by deploying measures to prevent road sign thefts. Unfortunately, the thefts are not the only criminal activities causing trouble for the public. The Somerset Levels are grappling with fuel thieves who are exploiting the already-dire circumstances of the flood-stricken area.

The authorities must take robust measures to prevent such crimes to ensure the safety and well-being of the public. The replacement and maintenance of road signs and other public property should be carried out promptly, and the culprits must be held accountable for their actions.

Watch horror movies. Listen to appropriate music. Be musical. Write Gothic poetry and horror stories. Appreciate art.","output":"If you want to become a successful horror writer, there are a few things you need to consider to develop the right mindset and skills to excel in this genre. Firstly, it's important to have the right personality. Horror writers need to be prepared to delve into the dark and murky depths of the human psyche. It requires a certain amount of fearlessness to confront things that would scare most people. If you're the kind of person who loves nothing more than curling up with a good horror novel or watching a terrifying movie late at night, then you might have the right personality to become a horror writer. Reading extensively is another essential element for aspiring horror writers. You need to familiarize yourself with the genre and know what makes a good horror story work. By reading a variety of horror novels and short stories, you'll begin to understand the techniques and styles that are most effective at creating horror. Horror movies can also be a tool to learn about the genre, as well as a source of inspiration. You can study the way filmmakers create suspense, atmosphere, and tension through visual means such as lighting, camera angles, movement, and more. Watching horror movies can also help you identify the elements that work and those that don't. Listening to music is a great way to tap into your emotions and set the mood for your writing. There are many different types of music that can be appropriate for a horror writer, from classical compositions to experimental electronic music. Determine what kind of music stirs and inspires you, and use it to fuel your writing. Having a background in music can also be helpful as a writer. Being musical can give you insights into the rhythms and cadences of language and help you write elegantly and with a sense of musicality. Writing Gothic poetry and horror stories is an excellent way to practice storytelling and sharpen your writing skills. You'll have the opportunity to experiment with different styles and techniques, find your unique voice, and develop your own ideas. Lastly, a love and appreciation for art can open up new sources of inspiration and connections to the wider world of horror. Artistic inspiration can come from all kinds of sources, from classic horror paintings to contemporary mixed media installations. In conclusion, if you're an individual with the right personality and the willingness to learn, you can become a successful horror writer. The key is to immerse yourself in the genre, sample everything it has to offer, and hone your skills through practice and dedication. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"Evaluation ****.

A proper warm-up routine can help prevent injuries and improve performance. It is recommended to start with some light cardio exercise to gradually increase your heart rate and body temperature. After that, it’s essential to stretch out your muscles correctly. Calves and hamstrings are often neglected but are essential muscle groups. Stretching your calves can be done by standing near a wall with one foot forward and the other foot back, then slowly lean into the wall until you feel the stretch. Target your hamstrings by lying on your back and slowly raising one leg with your knee slightly bent before grasping the back of your thigh and gently pulling it towards your chest. Quads are also important muscles to stretch out before a workout. Perform a quad stretch by standing with your feet hip-width apart and slowly bending one knee, bringing your foot towards your buttocks, and grasping your ankle with your hand before gently pulling your foot towards your buttocks. After your workout, it’s equally important to cool down correctly. This can help prevent stiffness and soreness later on. A suitable cooling-down routine can include light cardio exercise and stretching. Swimming is an excellent form of exercise but can be challenging for those who experience cramps. If you're experiencing calf cramps, it is recommended to avoid swimming until you've resolved these issues.

While the number of households headed by married couples is higher than those headed by lone parents, the latter figure is lower than the national average. In general, households headed by married couples have a higher likelihood of being financially stable and having a consistent income. This is due to the fact that both individuals in the relationship may contribute to the household income, as well as share expenses and financial responsibilities. Additionally, married couples may have access to certain benefits and tax breaks that lone parents do not. On the other hand, lone parents may face a greater financial burden as they are solely responsible for providing for their family. This can be particularly challenging if the lone parent is a single income household or has limited access to employment opportunities. While lone-parent households may have lower average income levels and face more financial struggles, it is important to note that there is often significant diversity within this group. For example, lone parents headed by women may face greater economic challenges than those headed by men. Overall, the figure of households headed by lone parents was below the national average when compared to those headed by married couples.

The Mercedes driver completed 18 laps before the crash occurred, which the team attributed to a 'front-wing failure'. Fortunately, the reigning world champion emerged unscathed from the incident.

It forms the basis for higher math concepts, and without a solid grasp of addition, a student may find it challenging to keep up with their peers. Here are some tips to help a student master addition: Firstly, understand the concept. Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their sum. The concept must be thoroughly grasped before proceeding to more complex arithmetic. Once a student has developed a clear understanding of addition, they can begin to practice with a small number. Secondly, working through all the different addend combinations is crucial. Start by adding numbers within ten, then move on to addends that total to twenty or thirty. As the student becomes more confident in their abilities, increase the number of addends until they are comfortable adding larger numbers. Thirdly, visuals can be helpful in understanding addition. For younger students, using manipulatives such as blocks or counters can make the concept of addition more tangible. Visual aids such as diagrams or charts can also be helpful in breaking down the addition process into manageable steps. Lastly, consistent practice is vital to mastering addition. Daily practice sessions should be incorporated into the student’s routine until they are confident in their abilities. In summary, understanding the concept, practicing with small numbers, working through different addend combinations, and using visuals, if necessary, are key strategies for mastering addition."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Anders Osborne, recordLabel, Alligator Records; Alligator Records, location, Chicago; Anders Osborne, genre, Rock music; Anders Osborne, recordLabel, Okeh Records.

As if that wasn’t bad enough, a passerby pretended to help but instead stole Hawkins’ £6k Kawasaki, making his bad situation even worse. According to reports, the collision was serious enough to warrant hospitalization. However, the theft of his motorcycle added insult to injury, leaving Hawkins without a means to get himself to his medical appointments and making the whole experience even more traumatic. The passerby who initially approached Hawkins pretended to be offering help, but the moment Hawkins was down and out, the thief saw an opportunity to strike. Hawkins reportedly said that if he had gotten hold of the thief at that time, he would have ended up in the hospital alongside Hawkins. It’s truly disappointing that some individuals use the misfortunes of others as an opportunity to further their own agendas. Not only did Hawkins have to deal with his injuries, but he also now has to deal with the loss of his Kawasaki – something that is not easy to replace. The incident serves as a reminder for individuals to remain vigilant and cautious, even in times of distress. It’s a sad reality that there are people who take advantage of others in vulnerable situations.

This incident can be traced back to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, for which her brothers were sought. While Tamerlan died in a police shootout, Dzhokhar was captured and awaits trial. The connection between the Tsarnaev siblings is undeniable, and their involvement in the Boston Marathon bombing remains fresh in the minds of Americans. For Ailina Tsarnaev to be charged with a bomb threat is significant, as it raises questions about any potential involvement she may have had in the actions of her brothers. It is important to note, however, that individuals should not be held responsible for the actions of their family members. Ailina Tsarnaev should be considered innocent until proven guilty, and the evidence presented in court should ultimately determine her fate. Despite the outcome of the trial, the Tsarnaev brothers’ involvement in the Boston Marathon bombing will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on American history. The event remains a reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant and united against those who seek to harm innocent people.

Put out your pipe.","output":"Buying a Pipe and Pipe Tamper: A Guide for Beginners If you're interested in smoking a pipe, the first step is to buy a pipe and pipe tamper. When purchasing a pipe, consider the material, shape, size, and price. Briar pipes are the most commonly used and offer a good balance between quality and affordability. A pipe tamper is used to pack the tobacco into the bowl of the pipe and can be purchased separately or as part of a pipe tool kit. Choosing the Right Tobacco: A Matter of Taste Choosing the right tobacco is essential to a great smoking experience. There are different types of tobacco such as Virginia, Burley, and Oriental, each with its distinct flavor and aroma. The best way to find the right tobacco for you is to experiment with different blends until you find the one that best suits your palate. Packing Your Pipe: A Crucial Step Once you have your pipe and tobacco, it’s time to pack your pipe. To do so, start by filling the bowl with loosely packed tobacco. Gently press the tobacco down using your finger or pipe tamper, leaving enough room for air to pass through. Once the tobacco is packed, it should be firm to the touch but not too tight. Lighting and Smoking Your Pipe: A Moment of Pleasure To light your pipe, hold the flame over the tobacco and draw gently on the stem until the tobacco glows. Once your pipe is lit, take slow, gentle puffs while inhaling and exhaling the smoke. Avoid puffing too hard or too frequently to prevent overheating and biting. Enjoy the moment and savor the flavor. Putting Out Your Pipe: Cleaning Up Your Pipe When you're ready to finish smoking your pipe, gently tap the bowl against a hard surface to let the ash fall out. Then use your pipe tamper to gently tamp down any remaining tobacco. Once the bowl is clean, run a pipe cleaner through the stem to clean out any moisture or debris. In conclusion, smoking a pipe can be a relaxing pastime and a great way to unwind. Buying the right pipe, tobacco, and accessories, packing your pipe correctly, and smoking it with care are key to a satisfying smoking experience. Remember to enjoy the moment and handle your pipe with care. Happy smoking!"},{"instruction":"After passing through Bryson City and the Little Tennessee River , the Tuckasegee flows southwest for another before flowing into the Bryson City Island Park .

In Englishspeaking countries, his primary works are littlestudied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal graduatelevel theology and philosophy programs. Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself. For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and longtime friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine, both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy – the dominant strain of philosophy in Englishspeaking countries in the 20th century. Whitehead has also had highprofile admirers in the continental tradition, such as French poststructuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that he stands provisionally as the last great AngloAmerican philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror. French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour even went so far as to call Whitehead the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.

The results were not surprising, and reflect the increased fighting in Afghanistan and the relative calm in Iraq. The Army hopes to address these findings by increasing the number of mental health providers in the field. The surveys were taken this year, and focused on the mental health of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The results showed that soldiers in Afghanistan were experiencing greater levels of stress and anxiety than those in Iraq. This can be attributed to the more dangerous and unpredictable nature of the fighting in Afghanistan, compared to the relative stability in Iraq. The surveys also revealed that the number of soldiers seeking help for mental health issues has increased. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that soldiers are becoming more comfortable with seeking help and recognizing the importance of mental health in their overall well-being. The Army is taking these results seriously and is working to address the issue by increasing the number of mental health providers in the field. This will ensure that soldiers have access to the care they need, when they need it. It is a positive step forward in ensuring the mental health of our troops, and will hopefully continue to improve as our understanding of mental health and its impact on our soldiers grows. In conclusion, the recent surveys of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan provide valuable insight into the mental health of our troops.

The best way to prevent a carpet beetle infestation is to look for and remove any outdoor sources or nests. This can include bird nests or bee hives that may be present in the vicinity. Cleaning carpet beetle-prone areas frequently is another important step in preventing an infestation. Areas such as closets, storage areas, and carpets should be vacuumed often to remove any tiny insect eggs that may have been laid. Regular cleaning also helps to remove any food sources that may attract the pests. Sealing unused fabric and clothes in plastic containers is another effective way to protect them from carpet beetles. These pests can infest even the smallest of fabric items, so it’s essential to seal them up and keep them out of reach. Choosing synthetic materials over organic ones is also a good strategy for preventing a carpet beetle infestation. Synthetic materials are less attractive to carpet beetles because they lack the natural fibers that the pests are drawn to. When purchasing new fabrics or carpets, opt for those made with synthetic materials. In conclusion, preventing a carpet beetle infestation requires a combination of strategies, including removing outdoor sources, frequent cleaning, sealing fabric items, and choosing synthetic materials. By taking these steps, you can protect your home and belongings from the damage that these pests can cause."},{"instruction":"Emily: Does anybody now where the next ASEEES conference takes place?

His practice was established in 1932, and he continued to serve until his retirement in 1974. His legacy was continued by his son, who took over the practice after his father's retirement. During his long and prolific career, Dr. Macleod was undoubtedly one of the most prominent figures in North Uist. He had delivered most of the babies on the island, thus earning the respect and admiration of the community he served. His commitment and dedication were unwavering, and he earned himself a place in the hearts of the islanders. The Macleod family's commitment to serving their community has been compared to that of Dr. Finlay, a character created by the author A.J. Cronin. Dr. Finlay was a fictional physician who worked in a small Scottish village, put his patients first, and was always available to them. Dr. Macleod's life story doesn't seem too different from Dr. Finlay's. The Macleod family was there for their patients, providing medical aid and care whenever it was needed, regardless of the time of day. Dr. Macleod's passing came as a great loss to the North Uist community, but his legacy lived on through the countless lives he touched. His selfless service to his fellow countrymen left an indelible mark on the island's people’s hearts, and the Macleod name will always be associated with compassion, dedication, and selflessness. To sum it up, the Macleod family has left behind a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come."},{"instruction":"ere is some data about a restaurant: name = Midsummer House, food = English, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, near = All Bar One.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. The botanical term Angiosperm, from the Ancient Greek αγγείον, angeíon (bottle, vessel) and σπέρμα, (seed), was coined in the form Angiospermae by Paul Hermann in 1690, as the name of one of his primary divisions of the plant kingdom. This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, distinguished from his Gymnospermae, or flowering plants with achenial or schizocarpic fruits, the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked. The term and its antonym were maintained by Carl Linnaeus with the same sense, but with restricted application, in the names of the orders of his class Didynamia. Its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827, when Robert Brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the Cycadeae and Coniferae, and applied to them the name Gymnosperms.[citation needed] From that time onward, as long as these Gymnosperms were, as was usual, reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants, the term Angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers, with varying scope, as a groupname for other dicotyledonous plants.
