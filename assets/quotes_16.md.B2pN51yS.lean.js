Lowering the pressure of your car tires, for instance, can provide better traction and stability. The surface of the tire can also have better contact with the road, which can help prevent skidding and hydroplaning during wet conditions. In addition, using a lower pressure can also help reduce fuel consumption. This is because lower pressure tires can be more flexible and absorb road imperfections, which in turn minimizes the energy needed to propel the vehicle. However, it is important to note that not all vehicles benefit from a reduction in tire pressure. Some manufacturers have specific recommended pressure levels for their vehicles, and deviating from those levels can negatively impact the overall performance and safety of the vehicle. Therefore, it is always best to consult the owner's manual or a reputable mechanic before making any adjustments to tire pressure. In summary, switching to a lower pressure can be a simple and effective way to improve safety and fuel efficiency, but it is important to proceed with caution and follow the recommended guidelines for your specific vehicle."},{"instruction":"Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.

During World War I, Yudenich was initially assigned to the Northwestern front, but later commanded troops on the Southwestern and Caucasian fronts. He became known for his strategic abilities and was promoted to general in 1915. Yudenich played a key role in the Brusilov Offensive in 1916, which was one of the most successful Russian offensives of the war. After the October Revolution of 1917, Yudenich became an opponent of the Bolsheviks and joined the White Army during the Russian Civil War. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Northwestern Army in 1918 and launched an offensive against Soviet forces in Estonia. However, Yudenich's forces were ultimately defeated and he fled to Finland in 1919. He continued to be active in anti-Bolshevik activities and became a prominent figure in the émigré community. Yudenich lived in France in the 1920s and 1930s, where he was involved in various anti-Soviet organizations. Nikolai Yudenich died in 1933 at the age of 71.

However, tensions began to rise between the two groups as English settlers continued to push into Susquehannock territory. In 1637, war broke out between the English and Susquehannock, with the English capturing and executing several of the tribe's chiefs. This was only a few years after the alliance was formed, and it marked a significant shift in the relationship between the two groups. The reasons behind the conflict are complex and multifaceted, but a key factor was the English desire for land and resources. As more and more settlers arrived in the region, the pressure on the Susquehannock to cede their lands and resources to the English increased. The war between the English and Susquehannock was brutal and bloody, with both sides committing acts of violence and cruelty. In the end, the English emerged victorious and the Susquehannock were forced to submit to English control. The capture and execution of the Susquehannock chiefs was a turning point in the relationship between the English and the Native American tribes of the region.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The relationship between the United States and Egypt has long been a complicated one. While military aid has been a cornerstone of this relationship, experts caution that it is only one small piece of a much larger puzzle. Cutting off aid to Egypt, which has been a topic of discussion in recent years, will likely do little to change the behavior of the country's regime. Instead, experts suggest that the United States should focus on engaging with Egypt on a broader level, including promoting democracy and human rights. Despite potential consequences, Saudi Arabia has promised to make up for any aid that the United States cuts, further complicating the situation. This move could result in closer ties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, potentially shifting the balance of power in the region. However, if the United States were to cut off aid, Egypt could retaliate by modifying American preferential access to the Suez Canal. This could have far-reaching economic and geopolitical implications, and highlights the intricate nature of the relationship between the two countries.

The incident occurred when Proffitt went to fetch the mail, something he did routinely. Hammer, who had harbored a grudge against Proffitt over the years, seized the opportunity to settle the score. He shot Proffitt multiple times before fleeing the scene. The police quickly launched an investigation and managed to track down Hammer, who was found in his home, surrounded by weapons and ammunition. He was arrested and charged with murder. The community has been left in shock by the tragedy. Proffitt was a well-respected member of the community, known for his kindness and generosity. He had dedicated much of his life to serving his fellow citizens, both as a police officer and as a volunteer in various community organizations. Hammer, on the other hand, had a troubled past. He had been in and out of prison for most of his life, and had a reputation for violence and aggression. Despite this, many in the community are struggling to understand how he could have resorted to such extreme measures. The case has reignited debates about the need for stricter gun control laws, with many calling for tighter restrictions on access to firearms for those with a history of violence or mental illness.

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

However, many people find it challenging to move from thinking about what is right and wrong to taking action. The good news is that it is possible to use your knowledge of right and wrong to move from thinking to doing. One way to do this is by working on your communication skills. Verbalizing your thoughts and emotions allows you to express yourself better and make more informed decisions. Practice techniques such as active listening, expressing empathy, and clear communication to ensure that you always communicate effectively. Another effective strategy is to practice techniques that put your conscience into action. Don't just know what is right and wrong; take the necessary steps to do what is right, even when it is challenging. Some of these techniques include mediation, conflict resolution, and compromise. Setting specific goals for using your conscience in daily activities is another useful strategy. Goals help to keep you focused and motivated in your pursuit of doing what is right. For example, you could set a goal to volunteer for a social cause every month or make ethical purchases when shopping. Most importantly, living your values and standing up for your beliefs are essential in moving from thinking to doing. You must be aware of your values and principles and always strive to align your actions with them. Furthermore, you must be willing to stand up for your beliefs, even when it's not popular or easy. In summary, moving from thinking to doing requires deliberate action. By working on your communication skills, practicing techniques that put your conscience into action, setting specific goals, living your values, and standing up for your beliefs, you can make a positive difference in your life and society."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this Build a strong support system. Delegate when you can. Practice selfcare.","output":"Building a Strong Support System: The Secret to Success Success is not a one-person job. Behind every successful person is a team of individuals who have helped them along the way. These individuals are often known as a support system. A support system is a group of people who provide emotional, physical, and mental support to help individuals achieve their goals. Building a strong support system is essential for anyone who wants to be successful in life. Delegate When You Can One of the keys to building a strong support system is learning to delegate. Many people feel like they can do everything on their own. However, delegating tasks to others can free up a lot of time and energy for the things that truly matter. It is essential to build trust in your team and assign tasks that play to each member's strengths. This way, each task will be performed efficiently, and each member of the team will feel valued. Practice Self-Care Another essential element of building a strong support system is to practice self-care. It is impossible to be successful if you're exhausted, burnt out, or constantly overstressed. Self-care can mean different things to different people: it can be as simple as taking a walk outside, reading a good book, or even taking a nap. Make sure to schedule regular self-care activities into your week to ensure that you're taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental health. Build Your Support System Building a strong support system is about having people who can help you when you need it most. When looking to build your support system, it's essential to remember that quality is more important than quantity. Choose individuals who belief in you, support you, and are willing to help you achieve your goals. Remember to reciprocate the same level of support and care to those around you. In conclusion, building a strong support system is essential for success in any aspect of life. Delegating tasks, practicing self-care, and surrounding yourself with supportive people are crucial elements for achieving your goals. Remember that success is not a solitary effort, and building a strong support team will help you navigate through any challenge that comes your way."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = The Golden Curry, eatType = restaurant, food = Chinese, food = English, priceRange = more than £30, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Yes, here is the information represented in data form: - Name: The Golden Curry - Eat Type: restaurant - Food: Chinese, English - Price Range: more than £30 - Family-Friendly: yes - Location: near The Bakers"},{"instruction":"What would be an example of an negative review?","output":"An example of a negative review is: \\"Terrible experience at this restaurant.

Gunman opens fire Friday at Los Angeles International Airport. TSA screens about 1.8 million passengers and their luggage daily for prohibited items.","output":"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plays an important role in ensuring the safety of air travel, and part of their job includes screening passengers and their luggage for prohibited items. Unfortunately, it seems that despite their best efforts, more people are attempting to bring firearms onto planes. In 2012, TSA seized 1,556 guns at airport checkpoints across the United States. This number is nearly double the amount from 2007, indicating a troubling trend. It’s understandable that some people may forget they have their firearm in their carry-on bag, but it’s crucial to remember that firearms are prohibited from being brought onto planes for a reason - they pose a serious safety threat. This became painfully clear on Friday, November 1st when a gunman opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing a TSA agent and injuring several others. The shooter had a rifle in his luggage and was able to get past security without incident. This tragic event highlights just how important TSA’s job is, and why they need to take their role seriously. However, it’s worth noting that TSA screens roughly 1.8 million passengers and their luggage every day, so while the number of guns seized may be increasing, the overall rate of people attempting to bring firearms onto planes is still relatively low. It’s also worth noting that TSA’s protocols and procedures may not catch every gun or prohibited item, but their efforts are critical in preventing potential threats from making it onto airplanes. In conclusion, the increased number of guns being seized by TSA is concerning, but it highlights the importance of their work in screening passengers and their luggage for prohibited items. The recent shooting at LAX serves as a tragic reminder of just how critical their role is in ensuring the safety of air travel. It’s important for passengers to also remember their role in this process and to double-check their bags before heading to the airport to help keep everyone safe."},{"instruction":"PleasenotethatchildrencanonlybeaccommodatedintheComfortFamilyRoom.

While Obama spoke out about Trayvon Martin a week after the verdict, he waited more than a month to address the VA allegations. Crystal Wright, a conservative blogger and writer, recently questioned why Obama didn't give the same attention to the deaths of our veterans as he did to the death of Trayvon Martin. In her opinion, our veterans deserve the same level of attention and respect. And she's right. Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country, and they deserve nothing but the best when it comes to their care and treatment. The VA scandal, which involved a cover-up of long wait times and a failure to provide adequate care, highlighted the failures of the system and the need for change. While Obama eventually took action to address the VA scandal, his delayed response was disappointing. It's important for our leaders to prioritize the needs of our veterans and to act swiftly in response to issues that affect their well-being. Moving forward, we need to continue to hold our leaders accountable for ensuring that our veterans receive the care and support that they deserve.

Liverpool make three signings: Sakho and Ilori (permanent), Moses (loan) Hull agree £5m fee with West Brom for Long, who is in Yorkshire for medical. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Real Madrid winger Mesut Ozil is on his way to Arsenal after a transfer fee of £42.5m was agreed between the two clubs. This marks a significant move for Arsenal, as they have beaten rival clubs to secure the talented German midfielder's services. Ozil, who had been with Real Madrid since 2010, played a key role in their recent successes, including the 2012 and 2013 La Liga titles, and the 2014 Champions League win. Another transfer saga currently unfolding in the Premier League involves Everton's midfielder, Marouane Fellaini. He has reportedly handed in a transfer request, but the club is yet to agree on a fee with Manchester United, who are eager to sign the Belgian international. Fellaini was a key player for Everton last season, and his potential departure could potentially impact their performance during the current season. The biggest transfer news of the summer, however, has been the world-record move of Welsh superstar Gareth Bale to Real Madrid. The Spanish club paid an unprecedented £86m for his services, making him the most expensive player in history. Bale was unveiled in front of Real Madrid fans recently, signaling the beginning of his time at the club, where he will be expected to replicate the kind of form that saw him score 31 goals for Tottenham last season. Meanwhile, two Premier League clubs - Everton and West Brom - are currently embroiled in a tussle over Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian international spent the last season on loan at West Brom, where he impressed a great deal. However, he has since returned to his parent club and is keen to find a new home where he can continue to play regularly. Everton and West Brom will both be hoping to secure his signature, as he would be an invaluable addition to their respective squads. Finally, Liverpool has made three signings recently: Mamadou Sakho and Tiago Ilori have joined the club permanently, while Victor Moses has been signed on loan. Sakho is a French international defender who previously played for Paris Saint-Germain, while Ilori is a promising young centre-back who joined from Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon. Moses, who is a Nigerian winger, will be looking to boost Liverpool's attacking options during his loan spell at the club. In other transfer news, Hull have agreed on a £5m fee with West Brom for striker Shane Long, who is currently undergoing a medical in Yorkshire. The Irishman scored eight goals in 40 appearances for the Baggies last season and will be looking to improve Hull's attacking options in their campaign this season. Overall, this summer has been an eventful one for Premier League clubs, as they continue to make crucial signings and prepare for the coming season."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: who won season 7 rupaul's drag race??","output":"Violet Chachki."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sentence: \\"The cat sat on the windowsill watching the birds outside.\\" Concepts: 1.

Preparing for the donation itself also requires taking certain measures, such as consuming iron-rich foods and staying hydrated in the days leading up to the appointment. Getting a good night's rest and eating a meal 1-3 hours before donation can also help prevent potential complications. It is also important to have proper identification cards, such as a government-issued ID, to be presented at the time of donation. There are also activities to avoid before and after donation, such as engaging in strenuous exercise or consuming alcohol. Following these guidelines can help ensure a successful and safe blood donation experience, ultimately providing much-needed support for those in need."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 69*b = 454*b 2443*b 1321*b + 168532 for b.","output":"b = -584."},{"instruction":"Solve 6*z = 7*z + 1 for z..

Keep your raw meats on the lower shelf of your refrigerator. Put raw produce on the middle shelf or in the crisper. Keep your condiments on the door of your refrigerator. Put your cheese and lunch meats in the cheese drawer.","output":"Organizing Your Refrigerator for Optimal Food Safety and Freshness Your refrigerator is one of the most important appliances in your kitchen. It helps keep your food fresh and safe to eat. But did you know that how you organize your refrigerator also plays a crucial role in maintaining food safety and freshness? Here are some tips on how to properly arrange your fridge for optimal food storage. Top Shelf: Ready-to-Eat Foods and Drinks The top shelf of your refrigerator should be reserved for ready-to-eat foods and drinks. These are items that do not require any further cooking or preparation before consumption, such as leftover meals, drinks, and prepared salads or fruits. Keeping them on the top shelf ensures that they are easily accessible and less likely to be forgotten or pushed out of sight. Middle Shelf or Crisper: Raw Produce The middle shelf or crisper drawers are the ideal spots for storing fresh produce. This includes fruits, vegetables, and herbs, as well as any other perishable items such as eggs and dairy products. Keeping raw produce on the middle shelf helps maintain a consistent temperature for optimal freshness and safety. Use the crisper drawers to store delicate produce that is easily wilted, such as lettuce and herbs. Lower Shelf: Raw Meats Raw meats should be stored on the lower shelf of your refrigerator. This helps prevent any juices or drips from contaminating other foods and surfaces in your fridge. Use a separate container or tray to store raw meats to make cleanup easier and to prevent cross-contamination. Door: Condiments The door of your refrigerator is often the warmest part of the appliance, making it the best spot to store condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and salad dressings. Condiments are often high in salt or vinegar, which act as natural preservatives, making them less susceptible to spoilage. Keep in mind that the door should not be used to store perishable items that require a consistent temperature. Cheese Drawer: Cheese and Lunch Meats Many modern refrigerators come with a special cheese drawer designed to keep cheeses and lunch meats at an optimal temperature and humidity level. If your fridge doesn't have a cheese drawer, you can use the bottom shelf to store these items. Cheese and lunch meats should be wrapped tightly to prevent drying out and to prevent the spread of any bacteria. In conclusion, organizing your refrigerator is an essential part of maintaining food safety and freshness. By following these tips, you can ensure that your food stays at its best for longer, while also reducing the risk of foodborne illness. So take some time to rearrange your fridge and enjoy your fresh, healthy, and delicious food!"},{"instruction":"First question: What would happen if AntMan went inside the Hulk, then went super sized?

According to the data, in 1901 there were approximately 219,000 Jews living in Warsaw, making up around 36% of the population. By 1909, the number of Jewish residents had risen to over 250,000, accounting for approximately 38% of the city's population. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including the influx of Jewish immigrants from surrounding areas and the increasing number of opportunities for employment in the city's growing industries. In particular, the textile industry provided many jobs for Jewish workers and contributed to the community's growth and prosperity. However, this growth also led to tensions and conflicts between the Jewish community and other groups in the city. Anti-Semitic sentiments were on the rise, and many Jewish residents faced discrimination and violence. Despite these challenges, the Jewish community in Warsaw continued to thrive in the years leading up to World War II. By the outbreak of the war, over 350,000 Jews were living in the city, making up around 30% of the population. However, the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation of Warsaw led to the persecution and genocide of the Jewish population, with most residents either killed or sent to concentration camps.

When he was at Cambridge in the 1930s he knew Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess and other Soviet agents, who were recruited by Marxists. Four years before his death said he wanted to see MI5 files on him to find out who had 'snitched on him'","output":"The idea of defending the Soviet killing of millions of people in the name of Communism is highly controversial and disturbing for most people. However, one historian who openly supported this idea was Eric Hobsbawm. Hobsbawm was a highly respected historian who specialized in European history, and he was a prominent member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. When Hobsbawm was at Cambridge University in the 1930s, he associated with a group of intellectuals and left-wing activists who were also sympathetic to Marxist ideas. Among these individuals were Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess, who later turned out to be Soviet agents. Despite their political differences, Hobsbawm maintained a positive relationship with these individuals and continued to defend the Communist cause. In his later years, Hobsbawm became increasingly interested in his own personal history and legacy. He expressed a desire to see MI5 files on him, presumably to find out who had provided information to the intelligence services about his activities. This request itself has caused controversy, with some arguing that it is evidence of a guilty conscience on Hobsbawm's part. Regardless of how one feels about Hobsbawm's political views and associations, there is no denying that he was a highly influential figure in the field of history. His books on the rise of capitalism, the Industrial Revolution, and the role of social movements in shaping modern Europe have all been widely read and have had a significant impact on the field of history. However, his defense of the Soviet killing of millions in the name of Communism will always be a controversial aspect of his legacy. Even though he believed in the ideals of Marxism and Communism, it is difficult to reconcile these ideas with the atrocities committed by the Soviet regime under Stalin's leadership. Overall, Eric Hobsbawm was a complex and controversial figure whose work continues to be debated and discussed by historians and intellectuals around the world. Whether one agrees with his views or not, there is no denying the impact he had on the field of history and the political discourse of his time."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"{\\"name\\": \\"The Waterman\\", \\"eatType\\": \\"restaurant\\", \\"priceRange\\": \\"less than £20\\", \\"customer rating\\": \\"low\\", \\"area\\": \\"riverside\\", \\"familyFriendly\\": \\"no\\"}"},{"instruction":"Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (EYSC) Make this lower case","output":"education, youth, culture and sport (EYSC)"},{"instruction":"What are important things for people intending to major in aviation to know about?

They can be unsightly and uncomfortable and are more common in people with darker skin. Risk factors for keloid scar formation include a family history of keloids, having a previous keloid scar, being young, and having a history of severe acne. If you are at risk for keloid scars, it is important to talk to your doctor before undergoing any medical procedures. They may be able to help you avoid scarring or recommend treatments to reduce the risk of keloids. Another type of raised scar is the hypertrophic scar. This type of scar is similar to a keloid scar but does not extend past the boundaries of the original wound. It often occurs in people who have had surgery or experienced a traumatic injury. Risk factors for hypertrophic scar formation include having a history of keloids, being younger, being female, and being of a darker skin color. If you are at risk for hypertrophic scars, it is important to talk to your doctor about your treatment options. One way to reduce your risk of scarring is to avoid non-essential cosmetic procedures. While these procedures can be tempting, they can also increase your risk of scarring and other complications. If you decide to have cosmetic surgery, it is important to choose a qualified surgeon and follow their post-operative instructions carefully. This can help reduce your risk of scarring and other complications. In summary, keloid and hypertrophic scars can be unsightly and uncomfortable.

Do not try to make your friend see a bright side. Stay away from platitudes. Do not give medical advice.","output":"When it comes to discussing body image issues with a friend, there are a few things you should keep in mind to avoid causing any further harm. First and foremost, it's important to avoid discussing your own body image issues. While it might seem like sharing your own struggles could help your friend feel less alone, it can often do more harm than good. If your friend is already feeling insecure about their own appearance, hearing about someone else's struggles could make them feel even worse. Another important thing to keep in mind is to avoid trying to make your friend see the bright side of things. While you might think that focusing on the positive aspects of their appearance could help boost their self-esteem, this can often come across as dismissive or even condescending. Instead of dismissing their feelings, try to validate them and let your friend know that you understand how they're feeling. Similarly, it's important to stay away from platitudes like \\"you're beautiful just the way you are\\" or \\"it's what's on the inside that counts.\\" While these phrases might sound reassuring, they can often feel hollow or dismissive. Instead, try to offer specific compliments or instances where you've noticed their positive qualities shining through. Finally, it's important to avoid giving medical advice unless you're a trained medical professional. While it might be tempting to suggest a diet or exercise plan to your friend, this can be harmful and can even trigger disordered eating or obsessive exercise habits. Instead, encourage your friend to speak with a trained professional if they're concerned about their health. In conclusion, when it comes to discussing body image issues with a friend, it's important to be mindful of your words and actions. Instead of dismissing their feelings or offering empty platitudes, try to listen and validate their concerns. With the right support, your friend can work towards feeling more comfortable and confident in their own skin."},{"instruction":"]]> exciting and alternative molded glass fibre bench in a pale mint green. a statement piece. it was designed by walther pabst for ‘wilkahn’ in the 1960’s. kindly contact us to view, as it is in storage.

A video of NFL's Ray Rice punching his future wife in an elevator sparked discussions about the behavior of the woman, which is not only insensitive but also irrelevant. Women took to social media using hashtags to share their stories of domestic violence, highlighting the harsh realities that women face behind closed doors. A writer started the #WhyIStayed campaign to show why women felt compelled to stay in abusive relationships. This campaign allowed women to voice their experiences and provided a platform to address the issue at a national level. The reasons why women stay in abusive relationships are varied and complex, according to experts. They can range from psychological, financial or emotional dependence to fear of retribution or cultural expectations. While the public discussion on domestic violence has come a long way, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. Victims of domestic violence face significant hurdles, such as societal stigmas and access to resources that can help them escape their situations. It is important to recognize that domestic violence is not just a problem that affects women; it affects the entire family, including children who witness such behavior. It is essential to provide support and resources to people who find themselves in abusive relationships. Women who have experienced domestic violence need care and empathy, and it is the responsibility of society to provide those essential human needs. Programs that provide counseling, legal aid, and safe spaces for victims can aid in breaking the cycle of abuse. In conclusion, domestic violence is a sensitive and important issue that requires awareness, empathy, and action. It is unacceptable to blame or question the behavior of abuse victims, and it is crucial to provide support and resources to turn the tide against domestic violence. We must continue to have open and honest conversations on domestic violence and take actions to end it."},{"instruction":"prato can be a very interesting historical excursion that starts in the middle ages with castello dell’imperatore, the romanic cattedrale di santo stefano, the city duomo and the stunning palazzo pretorio, continuing with the renaissance with the splendid church of santa maria delle carceri. the 17th century and neoclassic style are embodied by the fontana del bacchino (small bacchus fountain) and the metastasio theater, and the avant guard period is represented by the “luigi pecci” center of contemporary art, an international reference point for today's modern artistic trends.

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.

Historians formerly postulated an epic age as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognize that the texts (which are both familiar with each other) went through multiple stages of development over centuries.

Sperling finds no textual evidence in either Chinese or Tibetan sources to support this thesis of Petech and Hisashi.

Rossabi states that this theory attributes too much influence to the Chinese, pointing out that Tibet was already politically divided when the Ming dynasty began.

However, there have been several attempts at longer field goals throughout NFL history, with some coming within just a few yards of that record-breaking mark. While 64 yards is certainly an impressive accomplishment, it's worth noting that the longest field goal ever recorded actually came in a college football game. In 1976, Ove Johansson of Abilene Christian University kicked a 69-yard field goal during a game against East Texas State. This remarkable feat remains the longest field goal ever attempted and recorded at any level of American football. Of course, not every attempt at a long field goal is successful. Over the years, countless kickers have tried and failed to make kicks of 60 yards or more, often missing by just a few yards. Whether it's because of wind conditions, poor technique, or simply bad luck, these kicks remind us of just how difficult it is to succeed at the highest level of football. Still, the fact that human beings are capable of kicking a ball 60, 65, or even 70 yards is a testament to the incredible skill and determination of the athletes who play this game. While we may never see another field goal as long as Johansson's 69-yarder, it's clear that kickers will continue to push the boundaries of what's possible, striving to make game-winning kicks from ever-greater distances."},{"instruction":"ere is some data about a restaurant: name = The Wrestlers, food = Japanese, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low.

This website allegedly charged students up to 1000 for her staff to write essays on their behalf. The website supposedly had many international students from all over New South Wales using its services to cheat. The unethical business was finally taken down, but not before causing significant controversy. The news of MyMaster's cheating services has shocked the educational community, who have always held academic integrity as a fundamental value. Not only does cheating undermine the quality of education, but it also inaccurately represents a student's abilities, making it an unfair advantage over their peers. Despite having been accused of running the website, Dou has denied being associated with it. Claiming ignorance of the website's existence, she has since shut it down. The truth of her involvement may never be fully known, but the impact of her business has undoubtedly created a problem for academic institutions and poses questions about the effectiveness of current anti-cheating measures. The rise of essay writing services online has made it more accessible for students to cheat, posing a significant challenge for educators. It is more than just a student's dishonesty, but also a breach of trust and academic values that they should uphold. Education is one of the foundations of society, and academic institutions must maintain the highest standards of academic integrity to promote a culture that values honesty and hard work. In conclusion, the issue of cheating in academic institutions is a complex problem that needs to be addressed through better policies for preventing and detecting its occurrence. The downfall of MyMaster and holding those responsible for their actions is a good start, but educators must continue to improve and innovate their approaches to prevent cheating and promote academic integrity."},{"instruction":"Shepherds Lodge BB is a good accommodation choice in Killarney What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"\\"Shepherds Lodge B&B is a good accommodation choice in Killarney.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: In the case of the ringporous hardwoods there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. At the beginning of the Caliphate or Islamic Empire, the reliance on courts initially confined sponsorship and scholarly activities to major centres. Within several centuries, the development of Muslim educational institutions such as the madrasah and masjid eventually introduced such activities to provincial towns and dispersed them across the Islamic legal schools and Sufi orders. In addition to religious subjects, they also taught the rational sciences, as varied as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, geography, alchemy, philosophy, magic, and occultism, depending on the curriculum of the specific institution in question. The madaris, however, were not centres of advanced scientific study; scientific advances in Islam were usually carried out by scholars working under the patronage of royal courts. During this time,[when?] the Caliphate experienced a growth in literacy, having the highest literacy rate of the Middle Ages, comparable to classical Athens' literacy in antiquity but on a much larger scale.

The team currently sits in third place in the Premier League, having won 10 of their 19 games. At home, they have been impressive, winning six out of eight games. However, their away form has been lackluster. The team has managed only one win in six games on the road. Despite their mixed form, former United striker Dwight Yorke believes that the team has what it takes to challenge for the title this season. Yorke, who won three Premier League titles during his time as a player at the club, believes that the current squad has a good understanding of what it takes to win the league. Yorke's optimism is shared by many fans of the club, who have seen glimpses of the team's potential this season. However, there is a sense of frustration that the team has not been able to replicate their home form on the road. It is clear that if United are to mount a serious challenge for the title, they will need to improve their results away from Old Trafford. In recent weeks, there have been signs that United are starting to address their away form. The team secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory at West Ham in early December, and followed that up with a solid 3-1 win at Everton a week later. These results have given fans hope that the team is starting to find its feet away from home. There is no doubt that United have the quality to challenge for the title this season. The squad is packed with talented players, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has shown that he has the ability to get the best out of his team. However, if United are to mount a serious challenge for the title, they will need to find a way to improve their away form. In conclusion, Manchester United's season has been a mixed bag so far. The team has shown glimpses of their potential, but their away form has been disappointing.
