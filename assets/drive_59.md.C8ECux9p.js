It‚Äôs meant to be derogatory, as in: Those damn Democrats just want to take your tax dollars and spend it. But the truth is that the Republicans are the don‚Äôt tax but spend even more party. And there is nothing fiscally responsible‚Äînothing politically conservative‚Äîabout cutting taxes and then spending the money as if you‚Äôd collected it in taxes. PAY AS YOU GO IS THE WAY TO GO People get in big trouble when they use credit to buy things that they don‚Äôt have the money for, expecting to somehow find that money in the future.

AN ADDED OBSERVATION The Comments thread on this topic lead to another ‚Äúsound bite‚Äù idea, so I‚Äôve added this blurb to the end. The observation that was posted in the Comments thread was that the Republican line on tax policy works because they appeal to so many of ‚Äúthe poorly educated,‚Äù whom Trump repeatedly says he loves. That got me to thinking about the phrase ‚Äúthe poorly educated‚Äù and how bizarre it is that ‚Äúpoorly educated‚Äù is a badge of honor for Trump supporters.

It's important to keep your audience in mind and create content that they will find interesting and engaging. One way to do this is by planning ahead and creating a content calendar that outlines what you will be posting each day or week. Visual content is also essential on social media platforms as people tend to engage more with visuals like images, videos, and infographics. So make sure to use high-quality visuals that are relevant to your content. When it comes to the length of your content, remember that social media is all about quick, easy-to-digest content. Keep your posts short and sweet, and use bullet points or lists when possible. Another tip is to use hashtags to help your content reach a wider audience. Use relevant hashtags that relate to your content and industry to increase your post's visibility. Don't forget to engage with your audience by responding to comments, asking questions, and encouraging them to share their opinions. Social media is a two-way conversation, and engaging with your audience will help build trust and foster a loyal following. Lastly, if you're struggling to come up with new ideas, consider repurposing old content that performed well in the past. This can save you time and effort while still providing value to your audience."},{"instruction":"Do you think Mark Cuban would make a good POTUS?","output":"Americans have this weird worshipful view of businessmen.

But atoms were known about long before that picture was, or could be, taken. While atoms were hypothesized as far back as Ancient Greece, the strongest evidence was chemistry. over several centuries of alchemy transforming into chemistry, it became obvious that all matter was made up of combinations of a relatively small number of elements, and that those elements combined in very precise proportions. Water was H20 - two parts Hydrogen to one part oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 existed, but was a different substance. But nothing like H2O(1.5) existed. The whole of chemistry could be explained by elements consisting of finite particles, which we call atoms, grouping up in fixed patterns. This model brought the flowering of Chemistry in the 19th century, even though no-one had ever seen an atom. The first direct evidence for atoms was when, in 1905, Einstein showed (in the paper which won him his Nobel prize) that Brownian motion could be precisely explained by the impact of atoms of water on floating seeds. The size and frequency of the movement of the visible seeds was exactly what would be predicted of water were made up of atoms. Not long after that, the Braggs invented X-Ray Crystallography, which showed that crystals diffracted X-Rays in exactly the way that they should if they consisted of atoms in a fixed arrangement. They could interpret the diffraction patterns to show the way the crystal,was assembled, thus \\"seeing\\" the atoms with the X-Rays. Since them, large numbers of devices have been build which would only work if atoms existed. But it was not until about 20 years ago, with STEM, that we were able to get such a direct image as that shown."},{"instruction":"What is the shortest hit home run hit in Fenway Park?","output":"Shea Hillenbrand on May 20,2002 hit a 303 home run at Fenway as a Red Sox player"},{"instruction":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","output":"It‚Äôs not ergonomic.

Smith and NBC's Chet Huntley and David Brinkley. However, Beale occupies the lowest rung among these giants, anchoring the fourth-ranked at UBN, widely regarded as the laughing stock of network television - a fact that apparently eats away at him and that has led to heavy drinking and suicidal tendencies, which were exacerbated following the passing of his wife. Beale eventually is sacked by network brass desperate to lift the network out of its increasingly dire straits, prompting Beale to use his valedictory newscast not only to announce his departure but also his determination to kill himself, followed by a nihilistic rant about the meaningless of life. Ideally, that should have been the end of his career, though with the network's assurance that Beale would be retired with dignity and afforded the psychiatric care he so desperately needed. Yet, things spiral down ever further after a young and rather heartless programming executive, Diana Christiansen, portrayed by Faye Dunaway, is inspired to retain Beale and repackage him as an angry prophet of the airwaves as part of a wider strategy to lift UBN's sagging fortunes. This leads predictably to the ruthless exploitation of Beale's illness and eventually to his murder by the network when his ‚Äúangry prophet‚Äù message no longer resounds among viewers. The Beale character portrayed by Finch has become iconic and in many ways foreshadowed the angry, befuddled and alienated white male stereotype of the 21st century."},{"instruction":"w do I make an equilateral triangle shape in Photoshop?","output":"Choose the Shape tool (U) and select the Triangle tool ( ) from the available options.

Hmm‚Ä¶ pets and children, let‚Äôs start with what they have in common‚Ä¶. They both require a lot of attention, love, and care. They both have unique personalities. They can both bring joy and laughter into your life. And, of course, they both have the potential to drive you absolutely insane. But, there are also some important differences. Pets tend to be cheaper than children. You don't have to pay a fortune for their clothes, or entertainment‚Ä¶ have you seen how much a goddamn iPad costs. For a pet, some chew toys and a litter box and you‚Äôre done, it's a helluva lot less expensive than raising a human being. Pets are also a lot easier to take care of than children. You don't have to worry about feeding them three square meals a day or making sure they are dressed appropriately for the weather. And while pets can be messy, they're not going to throw a temper tantrum in the middle of the supermarket. But perhaps the biggest difference between pets and children is the level of responsibility. When you have a child, you're responsible for shaping another human being's life and helping them become a productive member of society. When you have a pet, you're responsible for making sure they don't crap on the carpet. There is one HUGE advantage of having a pet dog over a child that I must include, the dog is always happy to see you. You could be gone for five minutes or five hours, and your pet will greet you with the same level of excitement and enthusiasm. Try getting that kind of reception from your teenager after you've taken away their phone. How should I write a speech about \\"pets are for people who don't have children\\"?"},{"instruction":"what ways was Christianity morally superior to the paganism it replaced?","output":"Despite all the charges that have been leveled against Christianity as an institution ‚Äî and they are just ‚Äî and all the ways in which it feel short of its ideals, the Christianized Roman Empire was morally better than the pagan Empire that it replaced in several ways. Consider that in general, charity and mercy were virtues under pre-Christian Rome but comparatively minor ones. Humility wasn‚Äôt necessarily a virtue at all. Under Christianity, all these virtues were promoted to high levels of importance, and that‚Äôs the world we live in today. Whether people really practice these virtues is, of course, another matter. Moral ideals were raised considerably under Christianity, although I suppose you could argue that hypocrisy increased as well. Infanticide First, the widespread practice of infanticide was stopped. This was a primitive form of birth control, and it was cruel: it involved exposing an unwanted child to the elements and letting that child die. In general, there were no protections for minors anyway. A Roman father basically had the power of life and death over his household, although moral suasion prevented him from killing all but the youngest children. Under Christianity, children were recognized as having greater moral protections; some of this, I think, follows from passages in the New Testament in which Jesus makes a strong point of advocating for the protection of children. I‚Äôd even go so far as to say that the outlawing of abortion goes back to this change. Jesus and the Bible have nothing to say about abortion‚Ä¶ but as long as infants were going to be protected, protecting a fetus seemed to be just another step. Slavery Second, consider that slavery as an institution was never questioned until after the Christianization of the Empire. Plato and Aristotle, for example, wrote extensively about ethics but had no problem with slavery at all. It‚Äôs true that the Bible, even the N.T., does not specifically ban slavery but seem to accommodate it. But again and again, Jesus takes the side of the ‚Äúleast among you‚Äù and the poorest and most downtrodden. Combine that with the sensibility of the Exodus story from the Hebrew Bible, and you have a sympathy with the slaves as opposed to the masters, which was (at that time) relatively new in Western culture. So it‚Äôs not surprising that, although not all Christians had any problem with slavery, the first voices raised against it were those of Christian bishops. Gladiatorial Games The ‚Äúgames‚Äù in the arena, as they were called, eventually went away. Some forms of entertainment ‚Äî such as chariot races ‚Äî were still okay, but after the Empire became Christianized, the idea of watching people die horrible deaths for the entertainment of others became morally less acceptable. Philanthropy There was philanthropy ‚Äî charitable giving ‚Äî both before and after the Christianization of the Empire, However, under paganism, the most common form was the building of temples and other public buildings‚Ä¶ for which the wealthy donor got lots of credit. Under Christianity, giving alms to the poor became more common, and ‚Äî encouraged by the words of the N.T. ‚Äî some of these donations were even made anonymously, or without seeking a lot of public credit.

This page is meant to give a comparison between computers running Apple's macOS and those running Windows. We are looking to help users who are interested in buying a new computer, not dictating which brand is the \\"best.\\" Security Mac - Traditionally, Macs have had fewer security vulnerabilities. Also, in overall numbers, Macs receive fewer viruses than PCs running Windows. However, these numbers can be misleading as Apple's computers only account for less than 10% of the market share. Consequently, PCs will show that they not only have more vulnerabilities total, but if one were looking to infect or illegally access the most computers, PCs are the easy target. PC - As stated in the Mac section, many more people today are using computers running some version of Microsoft Windows, which makes it a smarter target for attackers. That being said, Windows computers have had more security vulnerabilities than Apple computers in the past. Bottom line: While newer versions of Windows have made significant improvements in security, most [LINKED_TEXT: malware] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/malware.htm] is created for PCs.

They are especially cheaper when it comes to customization of the computer's [LINKED_TEXT: components] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/component.htm]. Bottom line: PC wins this category. Operating system Bottom line: This section is even as you're comparing apples and oranges. Both macOS and Windows 10 are clean, fast, highly capable operating systems. In this category, it comes down to personal preference and the user's specific needs. This category is a tie. Note: Windows is put onto PCs by multiple manufacturers, most of which add some form of [LINKED_TEXT: bloatware] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/crapware.htm].

PC users can also install [LINKED_TEXT: Linux] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/linux.htm] on their computer and use it in conjunction with Windows or as an alternative to Windows. Software Bottom line: The number of software titles for Mac has grown over the years. However, Windows dominates the computer software market share, and developers are more likely to create software for PCs because of the potential in getting a good return on their investment. Furthermore, there are 100s of free programs available for PC that are not available to Mac owners. PC wins this category.

PC - PCs have always been highly customizable, from cases, to internal components, to monitors. As such, there are many different levels of build quality. Therefore, while you can get very high-quality components for a PC, you can also get those that are poor quality. Bottom line: While the quality of PC components can be just as high, if we are to rate quality across the board, Mac wins this category - but situationally. Customization and upgrades Bottom line: Apple machines may be customized with several options. All of their computers come pre-built, and are only manufactured by Apple. PCs, however, have more pre-built options, due to a higher number of manufacturers. Furthermore, for those who like to build their own computers, the options for customization are exponentially higher. PC wins this category. Boot time Bottom line: Traditionally, Macs have been faster to boot up than PCs. However, with the advent of Window 10, PC boot times have decreased dramatically. In some cases, Windows 10 performs faster than macOS. That being said, these differences are negligible when compared to hardware. The single biggest component in reducing boot time is the type of hard drive a computer has. Both Macs and PCs have [LINKED_TEXT: SSDs] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/ssd.htm]available to them, but those who build PCs have much faster options.

Consequently, Apple only had to create one set of [LINKED_TEXT: drivers] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/driver.htm]. PC, on the other hand, not only has many different pre-built manufacturers, but many interchangeable components as well, which required numerous drivers. However, in recent years all devices are [LINKED_TEXT: plug-and-play] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pnp.htm] in Windows and no longer require the user to install drivers. This category is a tie. Gaming Bottom line: Over the years, computer game companies have shown increased support for Macs. However, as we mentioned in the security and software sections, Windows own's 90% of the market share, and as such, developers are far more likely to create games for that operating system. Additionally, because (built) PCs are much more customizable, their ability to run computer games is higher. Except the Mac Pro, there aren't any Macs that can keep up with a PC running a mid-range [LINKED_TEXT: graphics card] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/video-card.htm]. PC wins this category. Repair Costs Bottom line: Apple strives to make their Mac product line as sleek and compact as possible. To do so, they continue to further integrate their parts. Thus, when their desktop computers need to be repaired, they usually require more than one part to be replaced. Most PCs, on the other hand have easy access to any part of the computer by removing a side panel. Laptop repair costs between the two platforms would be more similar, but Mac is still more expensive. PC wins this category.

According to this theory, humans have a need for psychological consonance. This means that our environment and actions should match our beliefs and attitudes. For example, if you believe in saving the environment, but fail to recycle, you will feel psychological discomfort knowing that your actions do not conform to your [LINKED_TEXT: beliefs.] [URL: http://beliefs.an/] [LINKED_TEXT: An] [URL: http://beliefs.an/] offshoot of cognitive dissonance theory is self-consistency dissonance theory, which specifies that our environment and behaviour need to match our self-concept (our idea of who we are). So how does this relate to the question? I will speak in more general terms about people who often gravitate towards abusive environments and relationships. Many of these people came out of abusive situations, and these situations, especially those that happened when they were very young, helped to form their self-concept. The self-concept that is formed when you are raised in an abusive environment is a devaluing self-concept, meaning you have internalized the messages that were transmitted to you by your abusers. Your abusers may have told you that you were worthless, that you were deserving of the treatment which they meted out to you, or, they may have given you these messages non-verbally, via their actions towards you. Even their lack of action may speak volumes. Once you have internalized these messages, you carry these beliefs with you, and they form your internal self-concept. You may have a deep-seated belief that you are unworthy of love, respect, and good [LINKED_TEXT: treatment.] [URL: http://treatment.so/] [LINKED_TEXT: So] [URL: http://treatment.so/] what happens when you end up in a good relationship? Society tells us that we should seek out partners/friends etc that will treat us well. However, for someone with a negative self-concept, this is easier said than done. They may find people who treat them well, but rather than feeling good when they receive love and appreciation, this environment may have the opposite effect on them: they end up feeling deeply uncomfortable. And this leads us back to the concept of cognitive dissonance. If your belief about who you are is that you are inherently unworthy of love and good treatment, then an environment which treats you well will feel dissonant. Dissonance is a deeply uncomfortable state, and it is almost impossible to maintain this state for long periods. Part of the theory of cognitive dissonance is the assertion that a state of dissonance needs to be resolved. Think of being in an uncomfortable sitting position. What would you do: would you maintain that discomfort, or would you change positions to be more comfortable? Most of us would attempt to make ourselves more comfortable. This is how it feels to someone who has a negative self-concept attempting to maintain a good relationship. They find it incredibly uncomfortable because it goes against their internal beliefs about themselves, so they need to resolve the discomfort by leaving the relationship, or destroying it, sometimes unconsciously. And though most of us would find it hard to understand, someone with negative internalized beliefs may actually feel more comfortable in a bad relationship, and thus, may seek out environments where they are treated badly. Yes, being treated badly hurts, but in their case, the treatment accords with their beliefs about how they should be treated, and may be their comfort zone. All of this is not meant to excuse abusive behaviours, but rather to shed light on a phenomenon we see regularly. The key to escaping the cycle of abusive relationships is to understand the chain of events that lead us to seek them out. The more we understand, the better our chances of making different choices. If you suspect that you have a negative self-concept, then the key is to work on this aspect of your belief system in order to become comfortable in healthy environments."},{"instruction":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","output":"Everything. Like countless other broken systems in this country, it has been evolved to make the most money possible for whoever profits ‚Äî at the cost of everything else. It needs to be abandoned completely and allow itself for a complete restructuring towards reaching the goal of fulfilling it's most true and righteous purpose, teaching kids how to learn and navigate and understand society, providing actually useful real life skills and important concepts, ideals and values‚Ä¶ the education system should only exist as a way to reach that goal in the best possible manner ‚Äî not to make money in the best possible manner. Our schools do not do any of those things i listed. From 3rd grade through 8th students are required to take standardized tests that measure math, writing, and language arts. Schools would be given more funding relative to the scores of these tests from their students and if scores were too low or not enough kids passed funding could be cut or revoked. It should not be hard for one to see why this is a bad way to provide education. A significant portion of schooling was spent teaching us how to take these tests and preparing us to get the best scores possible. I can tell you with out a doubt i learned very little if anything from all that time spent every year focused on test preparation. The writing tests in particular i always hated yet i would get perfect scores on them always because i would pretty much write by copying the model essay for what the test grades and switch some of the words out to match the context of the essay prompt. Which just seems like a really awful way to teach people how to write imo. A huge problem with this country today is our inability to use our government for it's intended purpose of being a tool for constant evolution that is lead by the people with the goal of improving and making life for ourselves as best as we can.

Many examples such as the nations stance on drugs are and have been so blatantly counterintuitive and extremely damaging for us due to it's incapability; doing the exact opposite of what its supposed to do.

I‚Äôve heard some westerners say things like ‚Äòyou shouldn‚Äôt wear a hat at the dinner table,‚Äô but I haven‚Äôt heard it from Chinese. That said, almost every time I wear a hat, I do get questions about why I‚Äôm wearing a hat. People seem to assume that it‚Äôs because I got a bad haircut or I‚Äôm having a bad hair day or something. Although some people do wear hats in China, it‚Äôs still not all that common, so in my experience people have tended to think it‚Äôs being worn to hide something rather than someone just wanting to wear a hat, but your mileage may vary. [LINKED_TEXT: Vladimir Menkov's answer to Is wearing hats popular in China?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Is-wearing-hats-popular-in-China/answer/Vladimir-Menkov] is a good answer on the topic of hats in China in general. It‚Äôs possible that hats are seen as a class identifier; the style of the hat matters, but wearing a hat at all might at times be perceived as lower class and/or hiding bad hair/baldness/etc."},{"instruction":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble. Should I sit in on his class for a day?","output":"I've seen that you've had quite a few answers from people who had school issues growing up. I'm going to tell you what's happened to my son since September last year. He was 11 and just started secondary school here in the UK. I knew the school as he has a big brother already in the school, and I had never had any issues with the school at all. At this point it's important to know a few things about Scott. He, like his brother, is autistic. When he gets overwhelmed he shuts down, to the point where he can't communicate with anyone, not even me, his brother or his dad and he can take an hour or more to regulate himself so he can start communicating again. He isn't naughty or disruptive, even when overwhelmed. He has an EHCP from the local council, that sets out what help he needs & how that help will be provided. He is an intelligent child & is much better at maths than English. So - he starts school in September & within a week or so I get a phone call from his English teacher, telling me that he's not working in class & asking for suggestions on how to communicate with him. This phone call is repeated several times & yet, despite these conversations, nothing improved in class & in fact things deteriorated. In November I had a very long conversation with the SENDCO (special educational needs & disability coordinator) at school. We spoke about how he really shouldn't be in the top class for English as it wasnt one of his strongest subjects, that he was not refusing to work, but was unable to due to the overwhelm & consequencetial shut down. I left it with the SENDCO and hoped that things would improve. They didn't. I had further meetings, communicated by phone & email & still things didn't improve. Scott was regularly handed behaviour codes for not working & got detentions virtually every week because of this. The SENDCO had said he shouldn't be getting codes because there's a difference between not being able to work (can't) and refusing to work (won't), but that didn't stop the teacher handing them out to him regularly. By December we were talking about him swapping classes, but because of the way the timetable is structured he would have to change ¬æ of his timetable, so it was decided not to do that because of the disruption it would cause, including the fact that he would have to drop out of the top maths class. Scott was included in these discussions & he wasn't convinced about the change, so it was left. After Christmas things continued as before, then we had 4 weeks away, over Easter, & his school report arrived. Much of it was expected but the English‚Ä¶ well, I was incandescent! Basically, 4 years before he's due to take his GCSE exams, his English teacher predicted he would be ungraded. She had written him off as unteachable. I took a couple of days to calm down, then emailed the school & said that even if I had to pull him out of school for the duration of his English lessons, he was not to set foot in that teachers classroom ever again. How dare any teacher write any child off like that, let alone one of mine! When we got back home, there was another meeting at school. This time the timetable change went ahead and was implemented on 3rd May. I had parents evening this week. The first teacher I spoke to was his new English teacher. Remember that child who got so overwhelmed that he couldn't work & who was completely written off? 2 weeks in his new class & he's already got star of the week, for a monster fact file he wrote in class. Apparently it had lots of similies in it and other really descriptive language. I feel that says more about his previous teacher than about him. Having had such positive feedback from his teachers, including the new maths teacher saying it would be easy to give Scott extention work to keep him stretched, I am now waiting on a letter telling me the outcome of the formal complaint I put in about the teacher concerned. I will take it to the next level, if I think I need to. Still being in this situation myself, I don't know if you need to sit in on the class, but you do need to find out more about what is happening with your son. Start by thinking about what you know about your son. Is it possible that he is misbehaving? Then try talking to him &, if possible, his friends. Do other kids get the slips, or just your son? Do they see the behaviour that is being reported? Talk to the teacher/school to get a better understanding of what's going on. Do they have cctv in school? Can you view that to see what's going on? If needed do what you have to, to check things for yourself. It could be that your son is playing up in school, so you'll need to find out why. Is it that he always plays up, wherever or whenever, or is this something different for him? If it's different- what is behind the behaviour? Is it the classroom, the other kids, the teacher? Or something outside school, maybe at home? If he isn‚Äôt playing up, why is he getting the slips? (Possibly safe to say teachers fault here). I wish you an easy & speedy solution to this & that your son fulfills his potential."},{"instruction":"What is the most shocking substitution in a football match?","output":"For me, this would be the most shocking substitution that ever happened, at least was meant to happen lol...Can you imagine that he did this?

We‚Äôve been in this situation at two different restaurants. Both places handled it differently. The first is Golden Corral. The dinner hour starts at 4pm. We would arrive at 3:45 & pay the lunch time rate. Before retiring from my employment, I worked from approx 4:50am-1:30pm. By 3:30, I was thinking of dinner & wanted to eat at 4. It‚Äôs also a good idea to arrive when the food is new & fresh. I must add that we haven‚Äôt been there in two years so it may be different now. The other buffet is an Asian restaurant that also has some American fare. For a couple years after it opened, it had the same policy as Golden Corral. You could arrive minutes before the dinner hour, pay the lunch rate & then enjoy the dinner food. This establishment would bring out crab legs, clams, salmon & prawns for the dinner meal. The owners of this place must have realized they might be losing money because they changed the policy. When guests arrive approx 30‚Äì45 mins before dinner is brought out, the host/hostess will ask if you are having lunch or dinner. If you pay for lunch, it is indicated on your check. Your server & mgmt will keep an eye on what you select from buffet. The food items that are only for dinner are clearly marked on the identifying labels in buffet area."},{"instruction":"Should I learn HTML and CSS in a time where everyone is making websites with WordPress? What is a skill in a tech field that I must learn as I‚Äôm 19 years old now?","output":"Definitely learn HTML + CSS! It‚Äôs not as hard as you think, and these days you can find lots of free high quality tutorials which answer most questions. When I first started out back in the 2000‚Äôs it was all ‚ÄòTable‚Äô styles ‚Äî an ancient technique to make layouts anywhere near decent. And you just couldn‚Äôt find any decent tutorials online, it was all in books which were a bit slow to demonstrate the concepts. So, find an HTML + CSS teacher you like and stick with them, ask them questions and pick their brains. Wordpress requires PHP, MySQL and data base knowledge. It's a different box of cheese and the learning curve can be a bit steep in comparison. It‚Äôs good to know, but you‚Äôd get better milage and wider application of HTML + CSS, other things like emails, (static) web pages, banners, animation etc etc‚Ä¶ But you can do lots of interesting stuff, like form handling, dynamic web pages that change at certain times of the year for example with PHP. When I was learning, I preferred to see the visual difference the code meant, and it‚Äôs easier to see in HTML + CSS. In my opinion, everyone should learn HTML + CSS. Then learn PHP to add dynamic spice and push it further."},{"instruction":"w should I write a speech about pets are for people who don't have children?","output":"Really you think pets are for people who don‚Äôt have children.

Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method that empowers online merchants to start selling without worrying about warehousing, inventory, or shipping their products. When you, the store owner, make a sale, you purchase the product from a third party, the dropshipping supplier. They then ship it directly to your customer on your behalf. This means that you do not have to worry about shipping logistics, your focus is instead redirected towards effectively marketing your store to convert potential customers. Dropshipping can be very profitable if you can keep your marketing costs down and find the right product. As a dropshipper, you get to keep any profits left between the price you sell the product for, less the cost of the product from the supplier, shipping costs, and any marketing expenses. Dropshipping is a very attractive business model because it is easy to set up, and much cheaper than traditional e-commerce business models since you do not have to purchase any inventory. This also means you are more likely to be profitable faster.

He was about 21 or so. He had hurt himself on the job lifting something heavy and his pain seemed quite out of the ordinary. The spine surgeon had no reason to doubt him so ordered the usual tests of x-rays, MRI, and prescribed him some pain medication and anti-imflamatories.- He was told to come back in a couple weeks and he thought he would be better with some bedrest and not go to work. The patient came back and was still in a great deal of pain and the doctor based on his examination didn‚Äôt doubt him and thought to continue the same course of treatment and gave him a cortisone injection as well. Two weeks later he comes back and he‚Äôs still not better. He repeats the MRI again and thinks maybe there was something he‚Äôs missing. He didn‚Äôt see anything unusual and neither did the radiologist. He goes over the MRI‚Äôs again with another radiologist in hopes he might find something that he missed. The second radiologist didn‚Äôt see anything either. The doctor didn‚Äôt want to doubt this patient and went on continuing with his course of treatment and gave him a back brace as well thinking it might help him get around easier. This went on for a couple more months and the patient wasn‚Äôt getting any better. The spine surgeon was beside himself as to what is going on and the work case manager wanted to know when could the patient get back to work. The patient at this point was six months absent and the case manager,wondered maybe he should see another physician and get a second opinion. The insurance company thought maybe the patient was faking it since there were no neurologic deficits and was able to walk and didn‚Äôt have any bowel or bladder problems. The insurance company decided to hire an investigator to follow the patient. They had video taped the patient every day for about a week and found that he had spent his off times surfing at the beach, playing basketball, and hanging out with his friends. There was one occasion where he was surfing on his surfboard and fallen off it two or three times and immediately jumped back on effortlessly. The doctor was given the video tape and he was furious and had the patient come in the very next day for an appointment. He confronted the patient who was still complaining of back pain. The doctor was furious and told him he was going to jail for insurance fraud and that if he were him he‚Äôd leave the country. He handed him a copy of the video tape and told him good luck, and never to ever come back in his office again."},{"instruction":"attending your youngest daughter's wedding in direct violation of a protective/restraining order a bad idea even if you have a wellrehearsed apology speech attheready?","output":"Don‚Äôt make your daughter‚Äôs special day about you.

For example, [LINKED_TEXT: Commutative property] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property]:[math](x^2+x+1) + (x^2-x+10) =(x^2-x+10) + (x^2+x+1) [/math] And, [LINKED_TEXT: Identity element] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element] of addition is the polynomial zero:[math](3x-1)+0=3x-1[/math] Next, notice that the set:[math]{1, x, x^2, x^3,x^4,ldots}[/math] forms a basis for the space of all polynomials. We see that the set is linearly independent because the equation: [math]sum_{n=0}^infty a_nx^n=0[/math] can only be satisfied for every [math]xinmathbb R[/math] when [math]a_n=0[/math] for all [math]ninmathbb N[/math]. Furthermore, the set spans the space of all polynomials because any polynomial can (fairly easily) be written as a linear combination of the elements of this set. Now that we have a basis, it's natural to think about writing a general element of the vector space in terms of the basis. If we denote the [math]n^{th}[/math] basis element as [math]e_n =x^n[/math] then the general polynomial [math]P(x)=sum_{k=0}^infty b_k x^k[/math] can be written as [math]P(x)=sum_{k=0}^infty b_k e_k[/math]. So we see that the coefficients completely describe the polynomial using this basis. It follows that we can then write the polynomial just by listing its coefficients (as long as we agree upon the basis). So it's natural to write: [math]P(x)=x^4+3 x^3-12 x[/math] as [math]begin{pmatrix}0 -12 031 end{pmatrix}[/math]"},{"instruction":"Did the post office create zip codes?","output":"Yes.

What they built was a rich and vibrant culture, not monuments to themselves. Perhaps we can grow that wise, if we don‚Äôt destroy our world before that through an obsession with ‚Äúleaving a mark‚Äù. Whether though luck or lack of it, the people of Australia did not experience the triggers that initiated civilisation in other places. The retreating ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere left behind vast amounts of glacial till that formed fertile river flats. The plants that grew in it formed the basis of the crops that are the basis of agriculture even in Australia. Even with the resources of modern agricultural research and breeding have not succeeded in creating new staples from Australian indigenous plants. The extinction of the megafauna in the Northern Hemisphere also led to the development of several herbivorous animals that are not only good for food and are easily herded, they were able to provide draft power for hauling wagons and pulling ploughs. No Australian herbivores are herd animals. Kangaroos scatter, rather than follow the leader, when threatened. That appears to relate to their predators being primarily solitary hunters: thylacines then dingos. Over much of the country the land is too infertile and too dry to support packs of large predators. Although kangaroos damage land less than cattle or sheep do, and their meat is nutritious and tastes good, all the resources of Northern Hemisphere agriculture have failed to work out how to farm kangaroos economically. As well, the Australian landscape did not benefit from a burst of soil fertility at the end of the Ice Ages because there was very little glaciation, so yet-another trigger for the development of sedentary agriculture was lacking. The Australian Aboriginal people did develop agriculture to a degree but rainfall and low soil fertility meant that agriculture supplemented their seasonally mobile lifestyle, rather than supplanting it."},{"instruction":"What‚Äôs going on with all the fires in Russia?

In cases where the target is a facility vital to the Russian war effort, I think its unlikely to be a false flag attack. This applies to attacks on the defence infustry and fuel depots. Given Russia for example is reported to be running low on precision guided bombs, an attack on a facility producing them would seem unlikely to be a false flag attack. If te target is a civilian one, such as the shelling of the village of Klimovo, I think that is probably a false flag attack becaise Ukraine had reportedly intercepted calls where Russian soldiers wrre talking about setting up false flag attacks.

There are a few reasons for this. People fall into old bad habits. They suffer some emotional trauma and lose the control they had on their food intake. They get lazy on regulating their food. They think they can resume their old food habits intact after losing the weight. (very wrong) The biggest factor in my own weight loss of 51 pounds and keeping it off for 19 years was how I lost it. It was with a minor calorie reduction daily- just a few hundred calories. As my weight dropped my metabolism did too, until my deficit diet became my maintenance number. When I hit my goals, I just continued to eat that way without any changes. It was like walking off an escalator without a change in pace. The statistics for successful weight loss are grim. While many can lose the weight, too many regain it. The 5 year success rate in weight loss (losing and keeping it off) is in the low single digits of percentage. Those of us who make it are called 1 percenters. But the secret of success is no secret. It is staying diligent when measuring what goes on your plate. It is not having second helpings. It is even not finishing what is on your plate. It is turning down offers to indulge (for holidays, birthdays, special occasions, etc.) because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt eat that way anymore‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat food is off my menu‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have a different food philosophy now‚Äù. It is having a Plan B for those times that things are about to go off the rails. It is about changing venues when meeting friends so it is not focused on food and drink so often. I have coached people along the way. I have always emphasized that losing is the first project, but keeping it off is a second, longer term project, for the rest of your life. Staying diligent and focused never stops. In time, these new habits become second nature.

You could get the correct numerical answer and only get 50% credit on the answer because you got it using incorrect processes or logic. You could get the incorrect numerical answer and get 99% credit on the answer if you used the correct processes and logic, but made a calculation error. We didn‚Äôt have calculators back then, just slide rules. It‚Äôs pretty hard to cheat on an exam like that; unless you got the questions ahead of time. Even if you did, you would need to go back and study to get the correct answer. On some of my exams you could even bring in your own crib sheet. You were allowed to bring in one 8‚Äì1/2 x 11 sheet of paper with anything written on it that you wanted. I remember writing in teeny letters to make sure I could fit as much as possible on the sheet, then running out of things to write before running out of space. This was even the policy in some of my liberal art classes. It was more important that you understood what the concepts were, than the dates. There really wasn‚Äôt that much to gain by cheating.

We are one of the most intelligent races in India specifically with languages. We learn any language in the world faster, from my observation till date. Most of the learned people among Kannadigas are fluent in English if not any other language. And we love to please everyone too soon; we know that the shortest way of pleasing anyone in the world and getting close to someone is through their mother tongue. Hence we forget about our own mother tongue and start conversing in their language, even if we know a broken stuff to speak. Scenario 1: We go out of Karnataka, we converse in their language, to become one among them. We speak so well that the people know that we are kannadigas, only when we explain. Scenario 2: We meet people from other states in Karnataka and mingle with them. We want to make sure they feel homely in our state; may be hence resort to their language and never ask them to learn ours.

Fake? No way! It is very common for social science studies to use theoretical assumptions that can‚Äôt be verified in practice. This is confirmed by a simple fact that most of these studies simply can‚Äôt be replicated. Additionally, most of the social research is done via surveys that can easily be manipulated with (I consider deletion of outliers as manipulation as well). Not to say that there is no way to stop a respondent from lying. Social science papers are damn easy to write and publish. My research field is strategic management and investment. This is not rocket science, of course, but neither it is a purely social science field. In fact, I had to know economics, taxation, and other most exciting subjects to conduct my first study.

I was looking through the lists of journals the other day, which, I hoped, could accept the first-time researcher without much of a reputation. And, to be honest, I didn‚Äôt see many options.

The full answer is not known. The situation can be compared with the state of affairs in the days of old quantum theory when physicists found themselves attacking theoretical problems with a mixture of old classical ideas and various new ad hoc hypotheses. They sensed correctly that a full new synthesis is awaiting and we know ultimately it was found in the form of quantum mechanics. String theorists are sensing something similar. String theory starts with a very modest looking proposal (in addition to all the existing principles of physics) the point like particles are really 1 dimensional string like object (which follow Chew's principle in the S-matrix to consistently interact with each other and respect world sheet duality). This is not a paradigm changing, ground shaking modification of the existing physics. And yet, when you make this assumption, with the incorporation of supersymmetry, you soon encounter all known beautiful ideas of physics in a consistent framework, be it gauge theories or gravity and it does more. It removes the arbitrariness of the number of dimensions of spacetime. It constrains spacetime to have exactly 10 dimensions. It removes the troublesome infinities of the quantum field theories in the most graceful manner. You can see in the ordinary quantum field theory, representing some interaction with Feynman diagram consist of singular points at the vertex. In string theory, the same process is represented by so-called \\"pant's diagram\\". You see there is no singular point in the pair of \\"pants\\". String theory is obviously finite. Strings come in two varieties. Open string and closed string. Two or more open strings can join to form one open string or closed string. Two or more closed strings can join to form only closed string. Therefore all types of string theory necessarily contains closed strings. Just like ordinary strings, these string have waves. In case of closed string, strangely this can go clockwise or anticloskwise!! They are referred to as \\"left movers\\" and \\"right movers\\". The different vibrational modes of the string correspond to different particles. The more frantically a string vibrates the more energy it posses and that means more massive it is. A point particle traces out a line in spacetime called [LINKED_TEXT: World line] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line]. A string sweeps out an area in spacetime called [LINKED_TEXT: Worldsheet] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldsheet]. However in quantum mechanics, string theory would contain [LINKED_TEXT: Anomaly (physics)] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_(physics)] and it becomes inconsistent in any other dimensions than 10. This is necessary if you want to keep the scale invariance feature on the worldsheet. So, string theory is necessarily 10 dimensional. The other extra dimensions are thought to be very small and curled up. The geometry of these compact extra dimensions affect the 04 dimensional physics. Also remember, not just any generic space will preserve the supersymmetry. Only a highly specialized space, called Calabi-Yau will preserve it. Superstring theory immediately solves the mystery of the straightness of Regge trajectories ([LINKED_TEXT: Regge theory] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regge_theory]). More over, the history of a string in spacetime, the so-called \\"world sheet\\", is a [LINKED_TEXT: Riemann surface] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface]. Now the extra dimensions can be compactified in a variety of ways. Each will give you a different type of low energy physics. It is estimated to have at least 10^500 different possible solutions. And this is one of the main criticisms against string theory for if you have 10^500 nos. of different solutions then anything might be consistent with string theory. Far from being a \\"theory of everything\\" it will simply be a \\"theory of anything\\". But is the situation that bad? First of all think about the [LINKED_TEXT: Standard Model] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model] of particle physics. It has many adjustable free parameters. For each set of values of those parameters it predicts a different universe. How many? Infinitely many! All will be consistent with the \\"standard model\\". String theory has absolutely no adjustable parameters as inputs of the theory and it is consistent with 10^500 different possible universe. Now 10^500 is a chicken feed compared to infinity. Isn't it? So string theory is a definite progress. You may object that \\"standard model\\" is never thought to be the ultimate theory of everything unlike string theory. You are right. At the present status, string theory should not be thought as a complete theory of nature but things are not static in string theory. At present, string theory should be thought as a consistent framework where you can meaningfully ask specific questions about quantum gravity to to get the general answers. To get our specific \\"standard model\\" from string theory perhaps we need more than just hard work of navigating the landscape of solutions. That's why theorists sense a missing link somewhere hidden in this structure. Some profound basic principle, like equivalence principle of GR, is seemed to be still missing. There are many miraculous things go on in string theory and everybody senses something deep underneath but nobody has as yet figured it out. Hopefully these fogs will clear soon and we shall be able to see string theory in its full glory.

The main, most common thing is if when we are spending quality time together. I don‚Äôt mean just playing or hanging around each other, I mean when I am laying down and she‚Äôs sprawled out completely taking over any personal space I may have had to begin with. It doesn‚Äôt happen all the time anymore because I‚Äôm much busier than I used to be, so when it does, she sucks it all up.

Well I‚Äôm not sure if she forgets, well no I know she doesn‚Äôt forget, more like she doesn‚Äôt care in this situation. But she has many other pet siblings, who also love when I have downtime. I started noticing the odd behaviour when I was laying with her and heard a noise in the kitchen, which I knew was my ferret making a mess, so I yelled ‚ÄúLola!

A learning management system (LMS) helps instructors deliver and manage online learning by creating a streamlined communication channel between instructors and students. The role of [LINKED_TEXT: LMS in school] [URL: https://uteach.io/articles/lms-in-school-role-importance-advantages] and for individual teachers is great. These software applications manage all types of content, including video, courses, and documents, and allow students to access all course content from any device. Instructors can use an LMS to manage rubrics, student discussion boards, and course syllabi, and they provide key features for reporting, progress tracking, and assignments and assessments. LMS is the software backbone for many educational institutions, particularly for those that primarily offer online courses. These solutions are designed for academic use and give schools a valuable tool that allows students to access course material from anywhere. As eLearning has grown in prominence at all levels of education, an LMS has become an even more central part of an institution‚Äôs digital instruction efforts. Instructors rely on these tools for content management, diversifying their learning activities, and giving students more control over the learning process. What are the Common Features of Learning Management System (LMS)? Today there are various platforms on the internet that you can use as LMS. One of the bests is [LINKED_TEXT: Uteach] [URL: http://uteach.io/]. This platform helps to create eLearning websites within minutes without any tech knowledge. And the greatest thing is that there is not any limitation of specialty. No matter if you are an English teacher, business coach, or yoga coach, you can create your personal website and manage the educational process. Here the education providers get an opportunity to make use of advanced features, like: Selling unlimited online coursesConducting live lessonsOrganizing webinarsOperating blogsCreating tests and quizzesProviding certificates, etc. Thanks to these features, teachers, and trainers offer a good and comfortable learning environment for their active and potential learners. Course creation and management: Instructors can create and manage structured learning content and set user permissions to control how students access the content. With an LMS, instructors can add a variety of media to enhance their syllabus, including text, images, videos, links, interactive tests, slideshows, and more. Teachers can upload entire courses and modules, enroll students or enable self-enrollment, and see individual reports on each student. These learning materials can be uploaded all at once, allowing students to follow along with content for the course's length synchronously or asynchronously. Course calendars: Instructors can set all upcoming course activities on a calendar for student access. This allows students to stay on top of all assignments and upcoming tests, and to see real-time updates when due dates change. Online assessment: Instructors can create and customize tests for students to access and submit online. Most platforms will support a variety of question types, such as multiple-choice, drag and drop, essay, true or false, and agreement scale. From there, instructors can grade assignments and post scores online for students to access. Additionally, in-person assessments can also be uploaded and graded on the LMS. Attendance management: Some LMS products allow instructors to track student attendance for classes and events, whether the student was late or absent. These attendance reports can then be viewed online by students to see where they stand in the class. Discussion boards: Instructors and students can create discussion topics for the purpose of completing specific assignments, continuing in-class discussions, or soliciting end-of-semester feedback. Students can respond to individual threads and edit their comments. Instructors can also set time limits on discussion access, which motivates students to respond within the given timeframe. Typically, all discussions will also be timestamped. Discussion boards give teachers one more tool to assess overall student competency in a particular subject. Teacher communications: Instructors can send messages to students directly within the LMS or via email, which usually integrates with the LMS. This allows teachers and students to have 1:1 discussions related to student performance or further discussion of class topics. Teachers can also set reminders and notifications to alert students of upcoming deadlines whenever they access the LMS. Dashboards: Dashboards allow instructors to organize all relevant information and keep it clean for viewing and tracking specific data. These interfaces can be customized to suit user needs and could include data such as average class grade, student attendance, assignment submission statistics, and student access time. Reporting: All LMS products contain some type of reporting feature. These reports are either prebuilt (in which case the user has only a limited number of offerings that are already in existence) or customizable. These may include reports on participation, learner progress, access time, quizzes, course activity, and more. Student profiles: Students can create and manage their own user profiles within the LMS, which helps build social relationships with classmates during discussions and helps instructors recognize their students more easily. These profiles can also contain contact information if teachers or classmates need to reach out to them."},{"instruction":"the eyes of a hedge fund employee, what is it specifically about retail stock traders that makes most of them so incredibly inept at trading stocks?","output":"The problem is really easy to define: the inability to ask the right questions.

Using that as a metric, the B-25 would be considered the best medium bomber of World War 2. I‚Äôm admittedly a bit biased because I have flown a B-25 (from the right seat for a half hour) and, for the most part, it is a very docile and easy to fly aircraft but has great turning capabilities - I can see why it would be used for as intermediate trainer as well as strafing targets. Noisy as hell and I was told that it was noisier for the pilots than other World War 2 twin engine aircraft. I can see the B-25 being an excellent traditional bomber at all altitudes which is probably the most tangible reason why I would rank it as the best. I know it didn‚Äôt fulfill the many roles of the Mosquito or Ju-88 and wasn‚Äôt a hot rod like the B-26 (which many people feel was taken out of service for political/personal reasons) but the B-25 served in US and Canadian forces until late into the 1950s and was well liked by its crews.

It involves a lot of Research work. You need to do a proper research on your topic with good analytical records, facts and figures. You also need to do some public surveys that‚Äôs a part of your research. You can follow below mentioned tips do it in professional way. Set deadlines early on in the process. Having a goal to work towards is incredibly important for sustaining motivation over a long period of time. But make sure those goals are flexible. That said, I pretty much immediately blew past my deadlines and had to keep adjusting them back. Ask for feedback early, and often. The sooner you can be communicating with your committee about your writing, the smoother your editing stages will go. Sit with your advisor with just a rough outline of the chapter and find out if it works. As long as you can handle feedback, anyway. There may be times when you don‚Äôt need actual criticism, and instead just need to write, or to have someone say something encouraging. Find out what your committee wants and expects from your work. Following the advice about feedback above, find out what kind of writing your committee expects. But remember that this is your dissertation. At the end of the day, this is your work. It represents who you are as a scholar (for now, anyway). Take time off when you need it. Dissertations take time, and you will need to take breaks and recharge at some point. But remember to start writing again. Short breaks are awesome! Take a week off to focus on grading 150 papers. Claim writing time by learning to say no. One of the challenges of writing a dissertation is being surrounded by people who don‚Äôt understand; some of your colleagues, friends, and family likely have no idea what writing a long form project like a dissertation is like. It is hugely overwhelming and distracting, and you need to be able to say ‚ÄúGo away, I‚Äôm writing.‚Äù But say yes sometimes too. As I said above, taking breaks is essential. Next time someone asks you to go for a beer, close your computer and say yes. Carve out little bits of writing time. Dissertation writing is a marathon, not a sprint. Writing often happens in little bits spread out over time. Stop making excuses. There will always be a million reasons to not write. You have other work to do, you have papers to grade, you have jobs to apply for, you have meetings to go to, your back hurts, your computer is acting funny, the stars aren‚Äôt in the right position. Celebrate accomplishments as you go. Take time to appreciate all of the little accomplishments as you write. But don‚Äôt let good feelings stop you from working. Don‚Äôt get distracted by small feelings of accomplishment: finishing one page means that you are now ready to write the next one, after all. Know that you can do it. You‚Äôve got this, seriously. If I can do it, you can do it. It‚Äôll be great. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Every Problem has a solution, whether it is [LINKED_TEXT: Dissertation Writing] [URL: https://www.godissertationhelp.co.uk/dissertation-writing-services/?utm_source=Quora&utm_medium=Answers].

GDP growth UPA-1, which started from 2004 till 2009, saw rapid growth in our GDP numbers. India was constantly growing at a rate of more than 8% in these 5 years. At the same time, Modi‚Äôs NDA led India‚Äôs GDP to grow by 7.5% during the 2014-19 period. So, both the governments were quite close in this regard. But if you look closely, you‚Äôll see that Dr. Singh got a Vajpayee-led India in 2004, which was probably the best phase for the Indian economy. He had led India to the cusp of economic dominance in his 5-year tenure from 1999-04. Much of the growth in the UPA-1 regime happened because of what Vajpayee did in his 5 years. Whereas, Modi led NDA, started their regime right in the middle of the rupee crisis, followed by the NPA saga. So, the ride was rocky for Modi and his ministers, but they did well in that time to get a stable GDP growth rate. The Second Tenure Both these PMs got the rare chance to lead India again. Even if I compare the first 2 years of Dr. SIngh‚Äôs and Modi‚Äôs 2nd tenure, the former did better. From 2009-11, Manmohan led UPA-2 led with complete caution to bring India‚Äôs economic growth back on track post the global economic crisis of 2008. The GDP numbers in this period were still around 7.46%, which was great considering the impact of the economic crisis. His govt. kept the demand up, had decent foreign policies in place, and were looking for stability rather than taking umpteen risks to get better growth numbers. For Modi, the cracks started appearing in 2019 itself, when the demand in the automobile sector started to come down rapidly. People started spending less and less on luxury, as the economic scenario was looking grim, and India‚Äôs FDI investments were going down. His ambitious policies like Demonetization and GST didn‚Äôt bring the intended result, and the country was facing a liquidity crisis. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Modi held the 1st wave well, and any other leader would‚Äôve handled the situation in a similar fashion, but the mismanagement in the 2nd wave has dented his charisma massively. Foreign Policies Modi is a clear winner here. His foreign tours have put India on the map as an upcoming powerhouse that can go the distance, and give some heat to China with its massive workforce, which‚Äôs oozing with confidence, and just waiting for good opportunities. Terrorism Congress governments have always been peace-loving, and so, terrorism was still pretty active during Dr. Singh‚Äôs 10-year regime. But the NDA government are pretty proactive in their efforts to eliminate terrorism from its roots. Modi has taken several actionable steps during his regime as PM till now in this regard, and while some of his steps are debatable, many have given the intended results, especially in the North Kashmir and border regions. And after the Galwan incident in 2020, Modi‚Äôs stance was the right thing to do. Corruption Dr. Singh‚Äôs govt. were tainted with massive corruption and many senior leaders at that time were accused, put to trial, and jailed. With the present govt., I haven‚Äôt heard huge corruption charges, but I‚Äôm getting a feeling this might change in Modi‚Äôs 2nd tenure. So, at this point, Modi scores above Dr. Singh, but this can definitely change. See, Dr. SIngh was a reticent leader who was more of a scholar. He tried doing good things, especially on the economic front, but couldn‚Äôt lead the way due to his style of leading. Modi, on the other hand, has tried doing many things, but execution is their real problem. So, even if he works tirelessly and leads emphatically, the results need to come out on the paper. And after the Covid-19 saga, he needs to show results more than anything now. So, 2 different leaders with 2 very different skill-sets and styles of leading. You‚Äôre the jury now."},{"instruction":"What are some examples of unusual creativity at its best?","output":"I have found one best architectural creativity in cute little sparrow.

However, there are several common criticisms and areas of concern that are often cited by experts and educators: Inequality: One of the biggest challenges facing the education system in the US is the persistent achievement gap between students from different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Students from low-income families and communities of color often have fewer resources and opportunities, leading to disparities in academic achievement and graduation rates.Standardized Testing: The emphasis on standardized testing has been criticized for promoting a narrow focus on test-taking skills rather than fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities in students. Critics argue that this narrow focus on test scores can lead to a one-size-fits-all approach to education that fails to meet the needs of all students.Funding: Education funding in the US is often tied to local property taxes, which can create significant disparities in resources and opportunities between wealthy and poor districts. This funding model can exacerbate inequality and limit access to quality education for students in underfunded schools.Teacher Shortages: There is a nationwide shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in low-income communities and rural areas. This shortage can limit the quality of education provided to students and make it harder to recruit and retain talented educators.Technology Gaps: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the digital divide in education, as many students lack access to reliable internet connections and devices necessary for remote learning. This technology gap can further exacerbate inequality and limit access to quality education for some students. These are just a few of the many challenges facing the education system in the US. Addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach that includes policy changes, investments in education, and a focus on equity and access for all students."},{"instruction":"What are the most amazing photos you have ever taken?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: The most amazing photos I have ever taken were of a stunning mountain range in Nepal.] [URL: https://www.enghamze.com/2023/04/how-to-prevent-damage-business.html] I captured a sweeping view of the vast peaks as they disappeared into the clouds and glistened in the sun.

I have the habit of going for second show on friday or weekends in chennai theatres(probably GK cinems, INOX virugambakam, Palazo). So the film named \\"HERO\\" got released. Sivakarthikeyan, Arjun, Kalyani Priyadharsan acted in lead roles and directed by the Mithran(Irumbuthirai director). As usual I booked tickets in GK cinema for second show. So coming to the experience, the show was housefull since it was Siva Karthikeyan film. I genuinely thought the film would be good, since director Mithran shined in Irumbuthirai. The movie started and I was preparing to witness some real HERO moments. But to my disappointment, the screenplay was very weak and I am not able to digest it. At some point I started making fun of the scenes and shouted loudly in theatre. Everyone was seeing me as I did some murder. I was waiting for the film to take off, but it never did. Interval came. I just grabbed some popcorn to avoid sleeping in the second half of the film. Post interval, it was pathetic. I was not able to find whom they are trying to potray as HERO ? Is it Siva Karthikeyan ? Is it Arjun ? Is it the students? Before I realise who was that, suddenly I could see Tamil Batman version in the film. They tried to copy the Legend director Nolan's Batman begins in this film. Seriously? How come you can do that ? I was laughing like anything for the scenes where Siva Karthikeyan is given training by Arjun. Then students preparing the bike for him ? That was unacceptable to be honest. In order for us to accept it, they have to develop that kind of belief in the film. But it never happened in HERO. That was my worst experience in the theatre, waiting for the film to get over. I never felt in that way before. I was not able to forward the film also to get over with it.

But only if you know the stages, and exactly, how much is needed to be done, you would be at peace. So, here is a precise guide to minor project in Btech. Happy Reading:) 1.Forming the group Disclaimer: This indeed is the toughest part. Usually colleges allow groups of maximum 3/4 size and yes, some colleges doesn't allow individual projects. So, you have to find the perfect group and remember people with back out and friends won't be supportive like before. Final year is a mess! 2.Finding the project idea Currently using any API and leveraging it or any idea involving blockchain, ML would get easier acceptance. Get your idea ready before forth year starts. Your idea would get tweaked a lot later on and also you need to get your idea approved first , and yes almost 50% get rejected! 3.Finding mentor and Synopsis submission Once, idea is accepted, find a mentor for your project. What is means is that you need to find a teacher in your department and remember they have limitation of certain number of groups only! So, find any mentor and submit the synopsis which contain brief aspects and purpose of the project. This must be done around 10th Aug. 4.First Presentation Now, first presentation becomes compulsory in the colleges where synopsis aren't checked. So, what happens is the project gets approved or rejected at this phase. First presentation usually happens in the last week of August. Its a simple 10 min powerpoint presentation of only your idea which would be crosschecked by all the mentors. 5.Progress report submission and presentation By the end of September, you should have completed the half of the project and that's what is checked here. Its now all technical, and code implementation! 6.Final report submission By the end of October you need to submit the finish project, submit your project report and get marked on the basis of how tough/easy the project was. This becomes actually easier as you have been approved and checked during earlier stages.

In fact, self-confidence has shown to be correlated with a lot of positive things in life such as quality of relationships and friendships, higher pay, better job and job satisfaction, and of course, happiness. Self confidence is a skill and can (and should be) developed not just for the reasons above. Self-confidence is very healthy. It really is about YOUR relationship with YOU. Here are a few tips from an article I wrote: [LINKED_TEXT: The Ultimate Self-Confidence Guide] [URL: https://tomassvitorka.com/how-to-be-more-confident-self-confidence-guide/]. There are 63+ different tips, methods and ideas you can use to start building your self confidence. 1) YOU ARE ALREADY CONFIDENT IN MANY WAYS This alone may change a lot for you. You are already confident in many ways. There isn‚Äôt just one confidence. Everything that we do has its own level of confidence, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôre actually confident in most things you do (think about it), but there are just a few things you feel like you‚Äôre not confident in. And that fine, you can improve it. But keep things in perspective and don‚Äôt disregard all the other areas of your life and skills you‚Äôre already confident and comfortable doing. You probably have some skills that most people don‚Äôt. Something you‚Äôre really good at. Maybe you don‚Äôt even need to think about it when you‚Äôre doing it. That is confidence. So rather than painting with a broad brush and think you‚Äôre not a confident person, isolate it only on the areas you actually need to improve. 48) MIND YOUR LANGUAGE Words are powerful. Yet, people use them haphazardly. I often point out during my coaching sessions, the words my clients are using. Sometimes, there are many words that can describe a particular feeling, object, or action. The words you choose will make you feel a certain way about it. You can say: ‚ÄòIt will be terrifying‚Äô or ‚ÄòIt will be uncomfortable‚Äô. The words can be used interchangeably, but they have a very different feeling. The word you chose will determine how you‚Äôll feel about it. I set my goals with a phrase: I will easily ‚Ä¶. People often ask me why I do that? It‚Äôs because I read my goals very regularly, and there are many of them. Every time I read ‚ÄúI will easily‚Ä¶‚Äù it frames how I perceive the goal. If you think it‚Äôs a meaningless difference, then Imagine I‚Äôd say ‚Äù I will struggle to‚Ä¶‚Äù at the beginning of my goal. I wonder how I‚Äôd feel about my goals then? Do you see my point? 56) STICK TO THE FACTS Our mind is great at imagining things and creating stories. We do it without knowing. All we need is a few facts, and we fill in space between them. Has this ever happened to you: Your boss didn‚Äôt greet you the way he usually does. In fact, you dismissed your greeting and didn‚Äôt even look at you when he walked into the office. You thought: Oh god, what‚Äôs going on? Did I make a mistake in the report? Oh, I bet I messed something up! Sh*t, I knew I should have waited and run it by James first. I‚Äôm so fired! Ok, what happened there? All you know is that your boss did not see your greeting and did not say ‚Äòhi‚Äô. The rest you conjured up. Our mind does that all the time. But we need to watch out for that because inner thoughts like this can systematically destroy every ounce of self-confidence you have. So, ALWAYS, stick to the facts of what you know and watch out for any stories you mind might be coming up with. If that happens, recognise it and question them. If you don‚Äôt have any evidence for it, give yourself the benefit of the doubt. Alternatively, if you want to be creating stories create such that will help you build your self-confidence. 61) STOP RUSHING I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of people who struggle with self-confidence tend to rush, do things last minute, and are often (nearly) late. Hey, I get it. Sometimes we just wait until the point where the pressure gets intense enough so we can no longer procrastinate. A bit of pressure like this can actually feel exciting. But rushing has a silent psychological impact that many people don‚Äôt realise. We rush because of fear of being late. The only way we fear being late is because there is some negative consequence or punishment for it. That means that there is something or someone superior to us and hence we‚Äôre inferior. Usually that‚Äôs probably the case. But many people rush just out of habit or put themselves in the position where they have to rush because they are late. That way you‚Äôre always putting yourself in the inferior position where it‚Äôs not even necessary. How can you build self-confidence when you keep putting yourself in an inferior position? Think about it.

Sometimes you need to run many functions in parallel, and you will end up reading many tabs about \`CreateThread\` function. So, in my opinion, don‚Äôt start with C++ unless you have the tools for drawing, monitoring and debugging.

If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","output":"Let's be clear any picture is not the object. The correct answer to the question: \\"Are atoms observable?\\", is no. An 'atom' is an idea. It is not a actual entity. It is an idea applied to a set of mathematical equations that can be related through a very long chain of calculations (including those embodied in the devices used to make the image) to observed events (say an image that is said to represent xenon atoms spelling IBM). What is observed is the image. It is a constructed artifact. Atoms do not look like the round balls displayed in the image. They don't look like anything. They have no distinct form. They are known only through the mathematics that describe behaviour of idealised events at atomic scale. [Edit] 16 March 2020. The 105 upvotes made prior to this date should not be taken as endorsement of this edit. It is important to understand that all scientific theories use mathematics to describe idealised/theoretical forms (quantum fields, sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, proteins, cells, etc), as well as the idealised/theoretical behaviour of the theoretical forms. We say a theory is valid when the theoretical behaviour of the theoretical forms maps or predicts the observed behaviour of observed forms. Science deals in ‚Äòtheoretical forms and behaviour‚Äô. That is all. It tells us nothing about the ‚Äòessence‚Äô of ‚Äòobserved forms‚Äô nor about ‚Äòthe nature of the Consciousness that observes them‚Äô. This contention will be disputed by many scientists who are now in pursuit of ‚ÄòConsciousness‚Äô‚Ä¶ but that is a whole other discussion that does not alter the fact that it is impossible to directly observe the ‚Äòthings‚Äô defined as ‚Äòatoms‚Äô. The link between the theoretical forms and observed forms is often made by long chains of mathematics that apply to the operation of the apparatus used in the experiment and the display of the result (including on a computer screen). Much of the maths is taken for granted by those doing the experiment as it is often performed by the engineers and technicians who design and build the devices/computers that the experimenters use.

How can we select in a particular fund for a longer period of 15+ years?","output":"Every year the top 5 mutual funds change. It can be due to many reasons. You cannot compare a large cap to a midcap or to a small cap fund. Similarly, you cannot compare a thematic fund to a diversified fund. Why? During a extremely bull market, small cap fund will give you better returns than other funds. These funds will suffer in performance at the first sign of problems in the market. Mid cap funds - will fall in between in such performance criteria between large caps and small caps. Similarly thematic funds. Pharma funds were under performers for 5 years. They were top performers last year. Again thematic funds differ in performance with diversified funds because of concentration of risk. So go by CRISIL rating star 5 and 4 funds. If it loses either of this status, move away from the fund. Or I follow a technique - I will get out 1 fund every year - whichever is the poorest of all the performers. And substitute by a fund of my choice expecting it to be a good performer. If a fund cannot perform even when the market hits a new high, they should get the axe.

Why or why not?","output":"Karma or 'the law of consequence' is a very powerful concept in Hinduism, which asserts that what you are today is purely your making and a direct consequence of your past action or inaction. We should not dilute such a wonderful, thought provoking wisdom by extending it beyond this life to past lives which people are going to reject anyway and create more atheists in the society. In its simplest form this wise conception inspires people to go beyond their capability to straighten out their lives. Say if someone is doing a low paying menial job and is struggling to make both ends meet, it simply means that he or she did not demand education or their parents did not do their due diligence and all these inaction or bad karma have cumulative karmic effect on ones lives. The karma concept encourages downtrodden people to act consciously and demand resources from parents or from community or from government and strive hard to dig out of the hole they are in. This wise concept, has been misinterpreted to mislead the uneducated and underprivileged people to believe that it is their bad karma of their past lives that they are now suffering, which kills their inspiration to aspire for a better life. This seems more of an intentional deviation of a wise perception into a prejudiced exploitative instrument. This might have worked in the past, however, as of now many have rejected this idea and have become atheists which is a highly dogmatic and perilous way of managing a rich culture like ours. It is time we look at the practicality of how such a great Hindu concept could be made use of and cleanup the superstitious stains that got ingested in its long journey from the past purely from exploitative mindset.

When a child in the camp acted in anger ‚Äî hit someone or had a tantrum ‚Äî there was no punishment. Instead, the parents waited for the child to calm down and then, in a peaceful moment, did something that Shakespeare would understand all too well: They put on a drama. (As the Bard once wrote, \\"the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\\") \\"The idea is to give the child experiences that will lead the child to develop rational thinking,\\" Briggs told the CBC in 2011. In a nutshell, the parent would act out what happened when the child misbehaved, including the real-life consequences of that behavior. The parent always had a playful, fun tone. And typically the performance starts with a question, tempting the child to misbehave. For example, if the child is hitting others, the mom may start a drama by asking: \\"Why don't you hit me?\\" Then the child has to think: \\"What should I do?\\" If the child takes the bait and hits the mom, she doesn't scold or yell but instead acts out the consequences. \\"Ow, that hurts!\\" she might exclaim. The mom continues to emphasize the consequences by asking a follow-up question. For example: \\"Don't you like me?\\" or \\"Are you a baby?\\" She is getting across the idea that hitting hurts people's feelings, and \\"big girls\\" wouldn't hit. But, again, all questions are asked with a hint of playfulness. The parent repeats the drama from time to time until the child stops hitting the mom during the dramas and the misbehavior ends. Ishulutak says these dramas teach children not to be provoked easily. \\"They teach you to be strong emotionally,\\" she says, \\"to not take everything so seriously or to be scared of teasing.\\" Psychologist [LINKED_TEXT: Peggy Miller] [URL: http://www.psychology.illinois.edu/people/pjm], at the University of Illinois, agrees: \\"When you're little, you learn that people will provoke you, and these dramas teach you to think and maintain some equilibrium.\\" In other words, the dramas offer kids a chance to practice controlling their anger, Miller says, during times when they're not actually angry. This practice is likely critical for children learning to control their anger. Because here's the thing about anger: Once someone is already angry, it is not easy for that person to squelch it ‚Äî even for adults. \\"When you try to control or change your emotions in the moment, that's a really hard thing to do,\\" says [LINKED_TEXT: Lisa Feldman Barrett] [URL: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/], a psychologist at Northeastern University who studies how emotions work. But if you practice having a different response or a different emotion at times when you're not angry, you'll have a better chance of managing your anger in those hot-button moments, Feldman Barrett says. \\"That practice is essentially helping to rewire your brain to be able to make a different emotion [besides anger] much more easily,\\" she says. This emotional practice may be even more important for children, says psychologist Markham, because kids' brains are still developing the circuitry needed for self-control. \\"Children have all kinds of big emotions,\\" she says. \\"They don't have much prefrontal cortex yet. So what we do in responding to our child's emotions shapes their brain.\\" A lot has changed in the Arctic since the Canadian government forced Inuit families to settle in towns. But the community is trying to preserve traditional parenting practices. Markham recommends an approach close to that used by Inuit parents. When the kid misbehaves, she suggests, wait until everyone is calm. Then in a peaceful moment, go over what happened with the child. You can simply tell them the story about what occurred or use two stuffed animals to act it out. \\"Those approaches develop self-control,\\" Markham says. Just be sure you do two things when you replay the misbehavior, she says. First, keep the child involved by asking many questions. For example, if the child has a hitting problem, you might stop midway through the puppet show and ask,\\"Bobby, wants to hit right now. Should he?\\" Second, be sure to keep it fun. Many parents overlook play as a tool for discipline, Markham says. But fantasy play offers oodles of opportunities to teach children proper behavior. \\"Play is their work,\\" Markham says. \\"That's how they learn about the world and about their experiences.\\" Which seems to be something the Inuit have known for hundreds, perhaps even, thousands of years."},{"instruction":"w do I view saved videos from Facebook?","output":"To view saved videos on Facebook, follow these steps: Go to Facebook and log in to your account.Click on the \\"Home\\" button on the top left of the page to go to your news feed.In the left-hand column, click on the \\"Saved\\" option under the \\"Explore\\" section.On the \\"Saved\\" page, you will see all of the items you have saved on Facebook, including videos.

However, I would confirm where they THINK they are even if it is wrong. For example - one elderly aunt thought she owned all the ‚Äúlittle houses‚Äù meaning each apartment. And when she sat in the lobby, she thought she was at work and everyone behind the desk worked for her. So I encouraged the thought and brought her a yellow tablet and pens so she could write and feel like she was working. She was happy and busy telling people what to do. When I would go to leave her ‚Äúhouse‚Äù, she‚Äôd ask me if I was going out through retail and I‚Äôd tell her I was. I doesn‚Äôt hurt to humor them.

Independence Day's greatness is identical to Byzantium, or to Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers, or Raiders of the Lost Ark.. The greatness of Independence Day is in its being a human expression. The trio of Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum have nothing to do with national celebration, or national identity - they are three pillars of human celebration, and human identity.(Bill Pullman is maybe one of the most overlooked charismatic actors of his generation) Independence Day doesn't do fluff, or cheese, instead it does bravery and attitude; it doesn't do propaganda (technically it does but then so do all films), but does what it needs to so that a badass like Smith or a cool presence like Pullman can operate as they're able to. I couldn't care less about how Resurgence ruins the original film: the original film is simply too cool to be ruined by anything."},{"instruction":"Movies, Bowling, Axe Throwing & More | Cinergy Entertainme","output":"To understand why some Americans (not all, let's not generalize) greatly value their \\"right to bear arms\\" to a point that may be perceived as obsession, one must understand what possessing a gun actually means. First and foremost, a gun is a weapon. While almost anything can be used as a weapon, few things are designed solely as weapons; guns are one of them. Unlike a shovel or a knife, a gun was created with one purpose and one purpose only, to kill. Although there is only one purpose of a gun, there are four purposes of using a gun: for food, for sport, for force, for protection. In the modern era of plentiful, cheap, accessible food, I find it hard to believe that many Americans own a gun for the purpose of obtaining food. In the modern era of established law and established authority of agents of the law, I find it difficult to believe that many Americans own a gun for the purpose of force. Those that do would be the criminals of society and - in my opinion - do not represent the demographic that this question is concerned with. In the modern era of electricity, internet, consumerism, and connectivity, it appears that entertainment is readily available to those who seek it. Thus, while I do not argue that many Americans who do own guns do not enjoy or use their gun for sport, I do not believe that sport is the primary reason Americans passionately demand to own guns. In the enlightened era of private property and individual ownership, I do believe that many Americans who own guns own their guns for the purpose of protection. Of a society that values hard work, material accomplishment, and cultivated ability, nothing is more important than the wealth one has obtained through one's own labor, except perhaps those whom one loves and oneself. In this sense, the protection of one's property, family, and life is of the greatest importance and thus requires a tool of the greatest power, a weapon capable of killing, a gun. The degree to which Americans value their \\"right to bear arms\\" directly reflects the degree of which they value their possessions, family, and life. If that appears to you to be \\"obsessed,\\" than that - to me - says quite a lot about America and those who live within it."},{"instruction":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","output":"I think the main reason for this is Kannadigas are not overtly, in-your-face kind of jingoistic people. People of other states have very homogeneous cultural identity. I consider even Andhra people (erstwhile United Andhra) are also difficult to generalize.

People who mostly prefer to speak in Tamil only (some times overtly) , their film industry, their larger than life politicians and people with darker shade of the skin (just a crude generalizations), Iyyars and Iyyangars and names mostly ending with N and M. If you think of Keralites, the main thing that comes to mind is their thick Malayalam accent even when they speak English, shiny coconut oiled hair, some times curly hair, pale oil colored skin tone, their highly intellectual movies, really beautiful un-Indian sounding Christian names, cream color sari clad women, spices, Kalaripayattu, and Ayurveda. Now if you think of Kannadagas what comes to mind. Most of us are very diverse. There are different regions in Karnataka with very diverse culture, cuisine, practices. Coastal region of Karnataka speaks Tulu, Konkani and Havyaka Kannada. Then Coorge which is very distinct identity, culture and language. Even Kannada itself varies, there is Mandaya Kannada, Mysore Kannada, Uttar Karnataka Kannada (Marathi influenced), Hyderabad Karnataka region Kannada (Urdu influenced). The clothes we wear differ significantly from region to region. The names are very diverse. Also as others have pointed out there has been very little out-bound migration from Karnataka when compared to other states and also it has been relatively less volatile region.

Also,‚ÄúDevil in the Dark‚Äù has very rich phaser strikes‚Äîone of the best I have seen! Secondly, the special FX were farmed out to different FX companies that is why phaser continuity was not the same. Probably the worst were the phasers fired at Doomsday Machine! The budget constraint effected the quality of the phasers and color. The production team became a bit wiser and then started to use stock color and stock footage. I believe Gary 7 & the gang of a ‚ÄúPiece of the Action‚Äù were the first two get the Pow/Bang/Spark setting. That is it! nobody was in deep thought about color setting that early, but it worked out in the end.

After multiple times of his posting his parties on social media, I guess someone reported to the Security Forces leadership that Trevor was doing what he was doing. So one day, he had his room searched, and sure enough, he had a beer and cocaine stash in his closet. Obviously, Trevor had no defense, since someone not only brought video evidence to his leadership, but they now had physical evidence of the illegal substances as well.

More than half the world's attempts to reach Mars - 23 out of 40 missions - have failed, including missions by Japan in 1999 and China in 2011.An evolved version of India's domestically developed Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, with extended rockets, will take Mangalyaan into an elliptical arc around the Earth. The satellite's thrusters will then begin a series of six small fuel burns, moving it into higher orbit before it slingshots toward the Red Planet.Mangalyaan has a formidable itinerary: a 300-day, 780 million-kilometre (485 million-mile) journey to orbit Mars and survey its geology and atmosphere.At Rs 450 crore for 780 million km, it costs Rs 5.77 per km, less than the fare of cabs and autos in India.At its closest point it will be 365 kilometres (227 miles) from the planet's surface, and at its furthest - 80,000 kilometres (49,700 miles).Five solar-powered instruments aboard Mangalyaan will gather data to help determine how Martian weather systems work and what happened to the water that is believed to have once existed on Mars in large quantities Mangalyaan will also search Mars for methane, a key chemical in life processes on Earth that could also come from geological processes.None of the instruments will send back enough data to answer these questions definitively, but experts say the data are key to better understanding how planets develop geologically, what conditions might make life possible and where else in the universe it might exist.In 2008-09, the Indian Space and Research Organisation successfully launched a lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, which discovered evidence of water on the moon.

Only a few days old, Charlie the baby hippo was orphaned after his mother could no longer feed him. Luckily for Charlie, rescuers found him and took him to an animal orphanage in Africa, where they nursed him back to health. About a week later Makhosi the Rhino was brought to the orphanage after its mother was killed by poachers. She was very traumatised and wouldn‚Äôt settle, so they decided to put her in the pen with Charlie the Hippo. Hippo‚Äôs and Rhino‚Äôs are usually territorial and don‚Äôt normally get along. It didn‚Äôt take long for Makhosi to settle once she was in the pen with Charlie. For the first time since she arrived Makhosi was able to sleep. The Hippo and the Rhino became attached to each other which was strange because in the wild they would hate each other. Charlie followed Makhosi everywhere and even started to act like the Rhino. They did everything together, bath, eat, sleep and eventually with a Rhino for a best friend Charlie the Hippo began to believe he was a Rhino. Charlie began to hate going near the water because Makhosi would never follow him in. He would only eat when the other Rhinos ate and this was a problem, because if Charlie could never learn to be a Hippo he could never be released back into the wild. Luckily for Charlie the orphanage brought in another orphaned Hippo, a female called Moomin. It didn‚Äôt take long for Moomin to fall head over heels for Charlie and would even get upset if she saw him getting attention from some one else. The more the two Hippo‚Äôs spent together the more Charlie began acting like a Hippo. He started going back in the water and even started to eat with Moomin. Even though Charlie was a Hippo again, he didn‚Äôt forget about his friend Makhosi. They would still hang out and they still took naps under the tree together. In early 2021, Makhosi was transferred to a game reserve with another Rhino that she got close to, where they started their transition back into the wild. Charlie and Moomin where released back into the wild in February of this year, they had spent 6 years together at the orphanage."},{"instruction":"What would a presidential debate moderated by IBM Watson be like?","output":"The supercomputer would likely break down from the weight of all the lies, falsehoods and misleading comments.

I decided to look intently at the little image in the car's rear view mirror -- no high tech apparatus. I really really really really intently focused all my attention on that little image! It was entirely convincing. That \\"little\\" image became my whole experienced reality: I was driving where I had been, not where the automobile was going. Fortunately I \\"snapped out of it\\" in time to avoid becoming a one car crash in the ditch on the right side of the road. (It was a very good place to have conducted this experiment, because there was a police barracks, a teaching hospital, and both Christian and Jewish cemeteries nearby, just in case.) You may try to repeat my virtual reality experiment at your own risk; I strongly advise you against doing so. I assure you: It worked. (Of course it will not work if you don't \\"give in to it\\", just like a video game won't work if you just look at the pixels as what some computer programmer coded up with branching instructions depending on what inputs you enter.) Moral of this story: VIRTUAL REALITY CAN KILL YOU. Forewarned is forearmed. Part 2. The above story is probably from around 2000. Fast forward to 2022. 1AM and I decide to drive to the office because a Consolidated Edison power failure at home made it impossible to do anything useful. My house is more than a quarter mile from where a tree had fallen on a power line. Pitch black. As I approach the cross road to turn left to go to town, I see a blinding police light ahead. Obviously I was not going forward. No way to turn around anywhere! I had to backup a quarter mile on a narrow 2-lane road with bad things to damage the car on both sides: a ditch, a steel guard rail.... All I had was the car's rear-view video camera and the yellow line in the center of the road (thank God for both those two or else I would have been dead in the water!). So now I really did have to drive where my car had been, believing in a little image, this time a small video screen not a small mirror. Long story short, after probably 20 minutes or more of cursing and braking and going forward in reverse gear another 40 feet and having to stop again because I was going off the road again... I finally succeeded in getting back to where I could change course and proceed in the opposite direction seeing the road ahead through the windshield. This too was very believable. I could not coordinate what I was seeing: that authoritative yellow line in the middle of the road in the little tv image, with turning the steering wheel to keep aligned on it. I had to keep compensating for the car almost going off one side of the road to try to get it back in the middle and try once more at it. One time I was so \\"lost\\" and at my wits' end (even though I knew exactly where I was...), that I had to reset and surrender maybe 50 feet and drive forward to be able to try to get back on the line. While I was in no significant risk of injury or death (hit the brake again!), I was continuously experiencing my arms not being able to do with the steering wheel what I knew in my head should be happening from where saw I needed to go. Back before computers, there were glasses a person could wear that inverted their visual field. Everything looked upside down. A person wearing these glasses and not taking them off, after a couple days, with the glasses still on, would suddenly start seeing everything right side up again."},{"instruction":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","output":"In the United States, the foods most commonly eaten for breakfast vary greatly depending on the region and culture of the individual.

The symbol for Mars looks like a shield and a spear from the war god Mars/Ares. It is also the symbol for the male sex. The ancient Greeks thought that Earth was the center of the universe and that Mars was one of the five traveling stars that revolved around it. Egyptians called Mars the ‚Äúthe backward traveler‚Äù because Mars appeared to move backwards through the zodiac every 25.7 months. Mars‚Äô red color is due to iron oxide, also known as rust, and has the consistency of talcum powder. Literally, the metallic rocks on Mars are rusting. The atmosphere (mostly made up of carbon dioxide) on Mars is so thin that water cannot exist in liquid form‚Äîit can exist only as water vapor or ice. Liquid water is considered for many scientists to be the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù of Mars. No human could survive the low pressure of Mars. If you went to Mars without an appropriate space suit, the oxygen in your blood would literally turn into bubbles, causing immediate death. If you were driving 60 mph in a car, it would take 271 years and 221 days to get to Mars from Earth. Mars lacks an ozone layer; therefore, the surface of Mars is bathed in a lethal dose of radiation every time the sun rises. Mars contains the largest labyrinth of intersecting canyons in the solar system called the Noctis Labyrinthus (‚Äúlabyrinth of the night‚Äù). Mars has the largest and most violent dust storms in our entire solar system. These storms often have winds topping 125 mph, can last for weeks, and can cover the entire planet. They usually occur when Mars is closest to the sun. Only 1/3 of spacecrafts sent to Mars have been successful, leading some scientists to wonder if there is a Martian ‚ÄúBermuda triangle‚Äù or a ‚ÄúGreat Galactic Ghoul‚Äù that likes to eat spacecraft. source: [LINKED_TEXT: Fun Facts: Mars] [URL: https://www.factbuddies.com/2013/07/fun-facts-mars.html]"},{"instruction":"Can mentally ill people be cosplayers?","output":"Anyone can cosplay!

It's important to remember that leaving an abusive relationship can be difficult and dangerous, and victims may need help and support to do so safely.

Not that we have any righteousness of our own, but that we are now able to approach the throne of grace in the presence of God because we are covered by the pure, sinless righteousness of Jesus. So now, when God sees me, He sees me in the righteousness of His Son. All because of the acceptable, finished work of the Cross. And this, because of the grace of God towards us. There are many who have been taught that if they live a good life, don‚Äôt do bad things, go to church and say some repeated prayers and obey the traditions of the church, that they will be able to enter into heaven when they die. This is false. No matter how good we try to be, we can never be good enough in our own righteousness to be acceptable to God (Romans 3:23). If we could then Christ died for nothing. We can‚Äôt, and Paul is pressing this important point home. The only way we can come to God is by coming by way of the Cross of Christ and by His great grace (Romans 6:23)."},{"instruction":"w do I create a customized WordPress website?","output":"If you are facing issue in creating wordpress website contact me on [LINKED_TEXT: http://fivver.com] [URL: http://fivver.com/] by here my gigs link [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.fiverr.com/s/X3we4G] [URL: https://www.fiverr.com/s/X3we4G]Here i will help you to create a wordpress website and also i build your website in cheap price."},{"instruction":"Why do people vape?","output":"Because of addiction simple is that.

If you already know C, then that and Python should be a good start for general programming, with Java and C++ as good followups. For web a development career track, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP may be better followups than Java and C++. Now ‚Äúlearning‚Äù a language is VERY DIFFERENT than actually using a language all-day, every day, for 3 years. Just knowing the syntax and how to form basic logical structures and objects is generally enough to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù a language.

Honestly, that‚Äôs not something to do ‚Äújust in case‚Äù or to have that language ‚Äúin your back pocket‚Äù ready for a hypothetical future employer. The reason to have that level of knowledge is because you ARE using the language and you WILL be using it in the future. That said, EXPERIMENT!

Your iPhone XS, XS Max and XR can have two cellular plans, one on a nano-SIM card and the other on an eSIM. But what is an eSIM? Short for embedded SIM, an eSIM is an electronic SIM that allows you to activate a cellular plan from a carrier without having to use a physical SIM card. The information on an eSIM is rewritable, meaning you can decide to add, remove, change operator networks and data plans easily-connecting devices with eSIMs to a mobile account can be done in minutes. eSIM needs to be supported by the carriers' network, so for your new iPhone XS, XS Max or XR you will need to choose an eSIM-compatible network for the second SIM support. eSIM is the only globally-backed remote SIM specification for consumer devices. In addition, this universal approach will also grow IoT by allowing manufacturers to build a new range of products for global deployment based on this common embedded SIM architecture. 2. What Apple's iPhone eSIM support will mean for you? 1.You will be able to change carriers without having to get a new SIM. You can change carriers or your plan in your phone settings. This means less time speaking with carriers, and ordering and waiting for new SIMs. Software does everything.[LINKED_TEXT: http://2.No] [URL: http://2.no/] more having to deal with cutting SIM cards, or finding adapters.3.With eSIMs, you can have two plans from two different carriers. This will allows users to switch virtually between carriers and phone numbers, which means you can: - Use one number for business and another number for personal calls. - Add a local data plan when you travel outside of the country or region. - Have separate voice, text and data plans. 3. What is eSIM+? eSIM+is a marketplace for electronic SIM cards. As the first platform to leverage eSIM-enabled iPhones, users can get SIM profile over the air and connect to local network around the world by simply scanning a QR code we provide.

All you need to do is selecting the area where you want to use cellular data, enter your email address to get the QR code. In this way, subscribers are no longer bounded to a particular carrier by a SIM card. The ways users switch between different cellular data are as easy as they switch between different channels with Netflix. Our service currently covers over 60 countries and regions.

There are three questions: How? What? Why? I think I understand the How of consciousness, even though it is classified as ‚ÄòThe Hard Problem of Consciousness‚Äô. [LINKED_TEXT: Hard problem of consciousness - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness] I am very far from certain about this. A lot depends upon the definition of: what is consciousness? This is very difficult to understand. There are so many altered states of mind. A one year old child clearly experiences a different ‚Äòconsciousness‚Äô when awake than when asleep. Yet the child will not consciously recall anything from this time of life in later years because part of the requirements for adult ‚Äòconsciousness‚Äô have not yet been laid down in the brain. Sleep walkers have been known to drive, climb a crane, catch the subway, respond verbally to questions, log into computers, all while being ‚Äòasleep‚Äô / ‚Äòunconscious‚Äô. They have no subsequent recall of their activities. So what is consciousness? And if one can eventually define what it is, which may confirm or disprove my conception of how it works, then there remains the intriguing question: Why? I have stated that our education system is very good at pushing facts into our intellect and conscious memory, but does a lousy job of teaching us how to use our consciousness properly and what it is there for. Which is true. In fact I suspect the education system screws us up a human beings. But - why do we have consciousness? What purpose does it serve? How should we educate our intellect to be more useful? Is it an evolutionary fluke, with no purpose? Does it serve as a survival ability, or could we survive and function perfectly well without it? How similar is my consciousness to yours? Mine has changed a lot from age 18 months to ten years, to twenty-five years to now. And if I enter a second childhood it will change again.

A: First of all, Sweden is not in NATO yet. Secondly, in theory, a sovereign state does NOT need permission from another country Third, in practical terms, just because one has the right to do something, it doesn‚Äôt mean he should do it for practical reasons. I have every right to walk down the street with 100K cash in my hand, and the thief has absolutely no right to rob me. However, if I decide to exercise my right, I am guaranteed to get robbed and potentially injured or killed in the process. So there are 3 things I can do. A. Don‚Äôt walk down the street with that much cash in my hand. This is like those former Soviet republics who have no intention to join NATO have lived in peace with Russia since 1991! B. If I really want to walk the street with that much cash, I make sure the thief is out of town and cannot rob me. Poland, the Baltic states, and Finland all joined NATO at a time when Russia simply couldn‚Äôt stop it. When the 1st four joined, Russia was a country in name only. When the last one joined, Russia was completely bogged down in Ukraine and simply couldn‚Äôt worry about Finland C. I arrange for an armed escort when I walk down the street with that much cash. This is like what the US is doing for Taiwan. I am not implying Taiwan aspires to join NATO. Rather, this is about defying a big and powerful neighbor. The Taiwanese are armed to the teeth! The media only cover what China can do to hit Taiwan, and yet rarely mention Taiwan isn‚Äôt going to sit idle to take the beating! Taiwanese sky has the 2nd highest density of air defense in the world, only next to Israel. When China and Taiwan are lobbing missiles at each other, more targets in China would get hit! This is a porcupine strategy. A porcupine can never take on a lion, but it would take a very stupid lion trying to eat a porcupine! In addition, all the Japanese islands between Taiwan and Japan are being fortified with their sight trained on China. The Phillippines also expanded the US military bases from 5 to 9. Even Vietnam, after millions of Vietnamese slaughtered by the U.S., has opened its arm for the U.S. military to return! This is all preparing for a showdown with China. Basically, China is up against not just the U.S. but many of its neighbors. What did Ukraine have before the war of 2022 broke out? A few 100 Javelin anti-tank missiles stored in western Ukraine. So if Sweden does join NATO in the near future, it would be case B above. The last thing one can do is like what Ukraine has done, ie. didn‚Äôt follow any of the three strategies above and is pursuing its NATO aspiration simply because it has the right. LIFE ISN‚ÄôT FAIR. Having the right is one thing, doing smart things to stay out of trouble is something else. Sure, if NATO is a club that you can join in a heartbeat, jump in by all means so Ukraine is protected. However, Ukraine‚Äôs membership has been pending since 2008! Not only Ukraine is not protected as a result, it is actually painting a bullseye on its own back with NATO aspirations."},{"instruction":"Can I get a Schengen visa if I only applied alone for a travel tour?","output":"Please consult with a migration agent with expertise in EU and Schengen migration law"},{"instruction":"Why do waitresses ask if Coke is okay instead of Pepsi?

Call me emo or immature, but I'm a sucker for tragic(love) stories. And to be honest, I dislike everybody who's reviewing ‚ÄúDil Bechara‚Äù on a yardstick of technicalities right now. I mean ofc, they can choose to do it, it's their choice to review it and then pat themselves on the back for not being an emotional-fool and being a true movie buff(as SSR would've liked it), but personally, it doesn't seem to be the right thing to do at this point in time. You complain about the IMDb rating being 10/10? It'll come down with time, hold on. It has already fallen down to 9.5/10. It's okay if it wasn't SSR's career best. It‚Äôs okay if it was hurried with and cropped to a great deal, the editing was messy, I admit. It's okay if you liked the Hollywood's version better. It's alright. But you can still choose to keep your feelings to yourself rather than blurting them out on a public platform in an indecent fashion and thumping your chest after that. I actually watched the movie only yesterday. You could say I was prepping myself for that. And boy, was I disappointed! I loved the music. You can say I'm biased here cause I'm a huge admirer of AR Rahman sir. But really, I thought the songs beautifully gelled the whole movie together. The casting was on point. Kizzie, Manny, Kizzie's parents, Abhimanyu Veer, Jagdish Pandey. Everyone. The first-half had me laughing hard. People say SSR overacted for his part but I found it alright. Maybe cause ‚ÄúManny‚Äù was actually trying to impress ‚ÄúKizzie‚Äù through his weird antics. Sanjana is a promising debutant. Although I find her a little off in real life, but as Kizzie she just owned the screen as well as the character. Saif's cameo was also pretty intriguing and intimidating. He was like this weird psychotic singer who has a knack for dark humor and really cryptic jokes. Hell! The moments which had me crying hard: When Manny was drinking beer with Kizzie's father and Kizzie's father realized how much Manny loves his daughter.When Kizzie was frightened after her encounter with the psycho and scary Aftab and how Manny tried to comfort her post that.When Manny said to Kizzie, ‚ÄúLet's just pretend I'm not dying!‚Äù üò≠That theatre scene.And finally the much dreaded last 15 minutes of the film. Aagh! Overall, I loved ‚ÄúDil Bechara‚Äù for what it was. Although I would've loved it even more had it been 20 minutes longer.

I often use copy paper, but also gift wrapping paper, napkins, book pages, foil as well as more special kinds of paper like elephant hide (paper, not the real thing), efalin, mulberry, washi, or kami. It all depends on the purpose, the model, and your skills. For a basic folding, I suggest copy paper and kami. Copy paper is ubiquitous and cheap. I usually go for packages of standard 80 gsm paper in different colors, in the A4 format. This format is standard in most places outside the USA, and with its proportions of 1:sqrt(2) it has extreemely nice mathematical properties and lends itself well to many models. And it is easy to cut into squares and other formats. Kami actually just means ‚Äúpaper‚Äù in Japanese, but in Western languages has come to mean thin, square paper in color/white back manufactured specially for origami (another Japanese word meaning folding of paper, gami being essentially the same word as kami). Kami can be found in a number of paper shops as well as Internet shops around the world. As always with internet shops it is better to buy from local shops lest you will be caught in unexpected vat and import taxes. Situated in Denmark, I mostly buy from within the EU. These shops also have a huge number of other paper types in stock, usually square, and mostly very beautiful. Most dedicated origami paper is square, as some purists think square, white paper is ‚Äúpurer‚Äù. Historically in Japan and elsewhere, as well as in modern origami, however, a wider range of paper shapes are used. Typical shapes are A, rectangular strips, and regular polygons up to octagons. Good origami paper is usually thin, strong, and holds a fold well. For some purposes such as soft flowers, napkin paper is suitable, for others such as larger bowls, thick and stiff paper is better. For special purposes such as exhibitions you might want paper with high durability and which holds its colors true for a long time. Ilan Garibi and Gadi Vishne has a series of paper reviews in the Fold of Origami USA, th latest being [LINKED_TEXT: Paper Review #29: Korukii aka Corky] [URL: https://origamiusa.org/thefold/article/paper-review-29-korukii-aka-corky].

The suitability of investment options depends on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some commonly recommended ways to invest money: 1. Diversified Portfolio: Build a diversified investment portfolio that includes a mix of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash. Diversification helps spread risk and allows you to benefit from different market conditions. 2. Equity Investments: Consider investing in the stock market through individual stocks or equity mutual funds. Equities have the potential for higher returns over the long term but are subject to market volatility. 3. Fixed-Income Investments: Fixed-income instruments like bonds and fixed deposits offer steady income and capital preservation. They are relatively less risky than equities and provide stability to the overall portfolio. 4. Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. They are managed by professional fund managers and offer convenience and diversification to investors. 5. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs): SIPs are a disciplined way of investing in mutual funds by contributing a fixed amount regularly. It allows you to benefit from rupee-cost averaging and reduces the impact of market volatility. 6. Real Estate: Investing in real estate can provide a source of rental income and potential capital appreciation. However, real estate requires substantial initial capital and has higher transaction costs. 7. Retirement Accounts: Contribute to retirement accounts like Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), or pension plans to build a retirement corpus with tax benefits. 8. Education and Skill Development: Investing in education and skill development can enhance your earning potential and long-term financial prospects. 9. Emergency Fund: Set aside a portion of your savings as an emergency fund to cover unforeseen expenses and avoid tapping into long-term investments during emergencies. 10. Professional Advice: Seek guidance from a qualified financial advisor to develop a customized investment strategy tailored to your specific financial goals and risk tolerance. Remember, investment decisions should align with your individual financial goals and time horizon. Avoid making hasty decisions based on short-term market fluctuations and focus on a disciplined, long-term approach to achieve your financial objectives. Regularly review and rebalance your investment portfolio to ensure it remains in line with your changing financial needs and risk appetite."},{"instruction":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

We have sequenced the genome of the wooly mammoth [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #CxMWh], and we still have not resurrected a mammoth, even though there are related extant species, the Asian elephant in this case, which could be used as surrogate mothers of an elephant embryo to which mammoth genes were introduced by CRISPR gene editing .[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #UBfsH] This is being attempted at the moment but in my opinion, though feasible, it's a long shot. And this is an ideal case because a pretty similar animal with a similar genome is still alive. In the case of a dinosaur, the closest living relatives are birds, which are their descents, and after birds, crocodiles. But dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago. That is a long time for divergence. Even if we had some dinosaur DNA, which is highly unlikely to happen because DNA does not last for that long (the oldest DNA to be sequenced is <1 million years old), we would have to use birds or crocodile embryos to edit the dinosaur genes into, and the end product would still be more of a bird and a crocodile than a dinosaur. Of course, we can never say never: some soft tissue containing collagen and potentially blood cells has been recovered from a 75 million year old dinosaur . [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #oocvX] As more museum specimens are analyzed, maybe we can get some proteins sequenced, and try to get a chicken or crocodile embryo to express at least one or two dinosaur proteins.

When I worked at a resort outside of Atlantic City - I saw & heard terrible stories of what guests would do. We were famous for our Friday night seafood buffet. It was very pricey but offered a great variety of seafood such as lobster and meat such as prime rib. Some folks would arrive and make a night of it. They would sit there for hours instead of one hour. Others would race to the buffet when food runners would bring out fresh/full pans of lobster. They‚Äôd have no shame as they‚Äôd pile up as much as would fit on their plate. Some would be prepared with 2 plates in hand. The worst infraction was committed by the female senior citizens who would line their handbags with foil or have ziploc bags in them. They would fill them up with shrimp, lobster, fried scallops. They were so bold - some not even making an effort to be discreet."},{"instruction":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","output":"Yes. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. The worst that can happen, in my professional opinion, is that they simply won‚Äôt contact you. There could be any number of reasons why you were rejected with or without contact, including automated reasons that will dispose of your application without a human even looking at (this happened once to me because my salary requirement was too high and the automated application program trashed it without any further review‚Äîa friend in the company asked around about my specific case and was provided this answer from HR). My (second) story: I had applied for a position and made it all the way to the end of the process (in my line of work and for the type of position to which I was applying, this is the day-long in-person interview, including a 45-minute presentation). Ultimately, I didn‚Äôt get the job‚Äîbut nobody else did, either. The Search Committee didn‚Äôt think any of the final candidates could meet the requirements and left the job vacant. One year later (at this particular organization, these things ran in one-year cycles‚Äîno less), the exact same job was posted again. I wrote a second cover letter that included a brief mention of my status from the previous year (though this would have been known by the new Search Committee) that highlighted what I thought were my biggest strengths based on the first interview cycle, updated my CV, and applied again. This second time I didn‚Äôt even make it past the point of initial consideration and was never contacted at all. Like most applicants to positions, I never found out exactly why I wasn‚Äôt hired the first time nor why I wasn‚Äôt considered at all the second time despite advancing so far the first time around. The total amount of effort the second time around was considerably less‚ÄîI was already in their ‚Äújob management system‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt have to go through all of that again. All I had to do was write the new cover letter, update the CV, and reapply‚Äîa process that probably took no more than four hours. To me, that effort and time was worth it for this job, even though nothing came of it. The second time the job ended up getting filled. Had it not (for whatever reason) and there would have been a *third* cycle, I wouldn‚Äôt have applied for several reasons. One: Two rounds of rejection, though different in nature, is enough of a statement to say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want you for this job‚Äù, regardless of underlying circumstances. Two: Any place that can‚Äôt seem to make up its mind after two complete interview cycles probably has no idea what they really want or has demands so high that nobody could fill them. To me, this is a huge red flag to stay away from that organization entirely."},{"instruction":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: HomeAmmunition Place Online is the best place to buy guns and ammo online.

Just like Infra red exists over a ‚Äúband\\" of the Wavelength Spectrum, so does Dark Matter, Quantum Gravity, and many other extremely long Wavelengths. Everything in the Quantum Universe is made of waves. [LINKED_TEXT: Eugenio Peraza ¬∑ 9moIs space made of ‚Äúsomething‚Äù?Is space made of ‚Äúsomething‚Äù? Quantum Space, Quantum Gravity and Dark Matter are sets of extremely long wavelengths that reside in their respective bands, in the extreme low end of the wavelength Spectrum. Such waves have very little Energy, and are mainly Quantum Mass. As such, they are affected by Polar Orbital Spiral Space Time Waves carrying Force, and Gravitational Waves, that creates gravitation with Quantum Mass; And they make up for the most part what we perceive is ‚ÄúSpace\\", when such waves Quantum Entangle into WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). They exhibit Quantum Viscosity (thickness) that in turn affects Energy Reactions and the rate at which Quanta travels through such waves and WIMPs. The Quantum Viscosity of Quantum Space is based on Quantum Gravity Force Intensity for the most part. Although, Quantum Space can also be compacted using Brute Force, thus exhibiting Quantum Viscosity. Those methods are especially evident in the Space ship example of Special Relativity describing Time Dilation due to Quantum Viscosity. Space Time is short for: ‚ÄúThe compacting of Space over Time\\". It affects Quantum Mass and determines Quantum Viscosity in and around Quantum Mass. Space Time Waves are like a conveyor belt feeding Quantum Mass to the core from all directions, thus creating Gravity effects. Space Time is created by the Space Time Generator, that is the Polar Orbital Spiral Trajectory of the Quantum Universe.

Why are we worried about Interstellar when even a bigger masterpiece has been made. Wondering which movie ? Obviously Dilwale. Love story in a love story before a love story and after a love story including generic love story. A love story sequence and a flashback love story sequence. That is a love story within a love story within a love story. Isn't that INCEPTION ? Let's say Rohit Shetty decided to make Interstellar. He will cast Shah Rukh Khan and Dips in the movie ( Deepika). Shah Rukh Khan will be a widower and his daughter will be Alia Bhatt. Michael Caine's role is given to ‚Ä¶lets say‚Ä¶.D Dharmendra Paaji. Shah Rukh Khan is lead to a secret research facility by the dream sequence of his wife's death. Let's not mock ISRO. The facility is set up by RAW. As Shah Rukh Khan is not Salman Bhai jaan , they can trust him with driving , so they give him a spaceship to fly to a wormhole. SRK meets Dips. Love at first sight song. SRK leaves Alia Bhatt , daddy daughter song. Turns out Alia is happy that father left. She calls her boyfreind Tushar Kapoor and they sing Daddy Mummy Hai Nahi Ghar pe. SRK travels in space ship. Few space ship asteroid stunts. Idiotic like this. They enter wormhole. Stupid music. Crappy dialogues between srk and Dips. They land on Dr Manns planet. But Dr Mann turns out to be Dr Manohar. Acted by Bappi aDa. Love song between SRK and Dips. Bappi Da tries to run away with their space ship but his gold chains get stuck in latches and he dies of hernia. Movie has gotten crappy by now. Srk and Dips move into a black hole. Turns out , both of them are alive and safe. They are welcomed a Yoda cum Sanskari Bahu in a Hummer or Scorpio who shows them how to use black hole to manipulate space time. Srk sends data to Alia. Rohit Shetty got the next part shot by Anurag Kashyap. This is how it happens. AK introduces another character , Nawazz , who kills them all in black hole. Srk and Nawazz fight inside black hole. While on earth , Alia cannot interpret signals and all human kind dies on earth. Srk killed by Nawazz. Dips and Nawazz go in a galaxy far far away and Nawazz becomes General Snoke from Star Wars.

Aspiring authors and veteran wordsmiths alike ignore these ironclad laws at their own risk. These guidelines are hardwired into our DNA and represent a minefield that aspiring writers must avoid. There is no negotiating or navigating such treacherous waters. These rules involve imagery that overpowers the subconscious mind and storm our conscious thoughts and dreams. Images that evoke visceral and easily articulated reactions among readers at every stage of intellectual development. Here are a few of the most crucial. But there is one that stands above all others. I. Do not under any circumstances make reference to corn or more specifically people eating corn. The reader‚Äôs mind will be immediately drawn to the repulsive act of defectation and picture your characters enduring a punishing bowel movement full of undigested corn. There are no exceptions to this rule. The simulacra for the human experience you painstakingly drew up will be replaced by thunderous flatulences as a matter of course. It may seem necessary to include a passing reference to corn in your Rockwellian depiction of cookout or a bucolic picnic. Perhaps the nostalgic memories of buttered corn sings its sirens song and seems integral to your biographical story. Leave it out unless you want the reader to picture your actual stools in a bowl. Or maybe you are drawing a dystopian vision of a rural countryside overrun. It doesn‚Äôt matter. The most mature reader won‚Äôt care a wit about your capable, gloomy, beautiful and slyphen protagonist. Her sexuality will take a backseat. Her personality will be forgotten. They will just picture her running to the can. Not a good thing. You may think adding ‚Äúsweet‚Äù in front of corn lessens the blow (as if people would gather to eat Hog Corn under an awning on a summer day). There is a reason ‚ÄúChildren of the Corn‚Äù and the adjective ‚ÄúCornfed‚Äù still resonate. Drawing any attention to corn immediately turns your work into pure scatological slapstick. Even a single line will suffice. Like a metronome, the reader will watch time elapse and wonder how long until the corn starts calling the shots. The reader will assume that your subjects eat corn far too regularly and that this abominable habit imposes stifling limitations on their ability to function. The sexual humiliation one endures when foolishly eating corn on a first date is something everyone can relate to. But not in a good way. And while it will be tempting to juxtapose villains with corn, as the mind will forever link them with foulness and faeces, it removes all depth from their character as they will not be taken as a serious threat but instead a pants crapping loser. It is crude propaganda and the aspiring writer should be above such silliness. 2. Prurient scenes and characters must be accompanied by a horse. The horse is an archetype for virility that is hardwired into our DNA. The horse is a doughty and trusted character because they endure the yoke of human overlordship and flourish. A representation of a horse must accompany any scene with sexuality, particularly male sexuality, depicted. Artwork in the background is an easy out. I recommend a horse whimsically nuzzling the subjects as their eyes lock and a carnal flame engulfs. Whilst the Bull Yeti is technically as well-hung, the thrusting and gyrating dances of the tumescent Yeti are not always appropriate and frankly a bit comedic. Unless you want the mind to drift to a huddled mass of drug addled Yetis weeping and babbling incoherently under an old covered bridge in the throes of an ergot induced hallucination, it is best to steer clear of our well-endowed forest neighbor. Male readers are likely to resent the Yeti‚Äôs prehensile penis when they contemplate their much more modest male basket. The fact that global warming has driven more Yetis near to civilization and their leering and ogling of the distaff side has not been all that well received is another reason to stick with the horse when creating a leitmotif of sexual tension and dynamism. The fecund Yeti in full-estrus on the other hand is a great subject. Her fierce dentata are largely overlooked due to the intoxicating pheromones she releases from the luxuriant fur of her nether regions. 3. Pony‚Äôs are inappropriate in children‚Äôs books The lewd and lascivious pony should not be trusted around children at a petting zoo. A randy animal, they have all of the appetites of the mighty horse but none of their dignity or restraint. Including a vulgar pony in a scene with children will brand your subjects as reckless and possibly depraved. 4. The author omniscient should be replaced by a Magpie who tells ribald jokes. Why stilted narrative devices still exist is beyond me. The Magpie is a natural fit for this role. This bird is glib, handsome, and has a rapier wit. It has a love of double entendres and puns. If you haven‚Äôt figured out that life is all about puns and double entendres by now. Don‚Äôt be the guy who has a problem with word play. If you are, brace yourself for an existence marked with pain and shame. People will find you to be insufferable and will say so behind your back and to your face. 5. Pain and Shame Life is pain and shame. Any effort to deaden this reality completely pulls the rug out from under your work. 6. Avoid phallic imagery While it can be powerful, it is 2020 and the world has come to find phallic imagery too predictable. How many times must the protagonist suffer a crisis of faith when a looming proto-penis appears from the ether to loom menacingly above them. The minatory specter of a fully engorged phallus bobbing in the distance can be found in just about every work in the Western canon. Instead consider adding scenes where your characters enjoy quiet and reflection in the moist folds of nature, evoking labial images or perhaps have them ascend a hill that resembles a mons pubis to signify their greatest victories.

Priest are the definitive twin guitar attack external of Thin Lizzy and honed the twin guitar harmony duality into a powerful punch with Halford's vocals. For my money, \\"Unleashed in the East\\" set the stage on through to \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". With \\"British Steel\\" sandwiched in there you have THE definitive crossover metal record of all time. To that extent, you have nothing in the pop metal realm without them. You also feel their influence across the board from Anthrax to Skid Row to wherever else you want to go. With Maiden, Jeez...I don't even know where to start.Both Priest and Maiden came into popularity at the butt end of punk and introduced an alternative to that scene. Maiden were by far the most on the edge of punk and metal. \\"Iron Maiden\\", \\"Prowler\\", \\"Wrathchild\\"....amazing, amazing songs that bleed the line of punk and metal. Paul Di'Ano deserves a ton of credit for what he did for those first 2 records shaping the early sound. I'm more a fan of the Bruce years and think the run from \\"Number of the Beast\\" to \\"Powerslave\\" is the holy trio of Maiden records. I saw them on the \\"Powerslave\\" tour and have never been the same. The respect they show their fans and the connection they have to the audience is a model for any band to follow in any genre. That they are still at it today, 35+ years later and playing (arguably) better than they ever did is nothing short of amazing. Mind you, this is a story where airplay NEVER EVER factored into their success. 85 million people bought their records and they NEVER charted a single. Ever. Remarkable.

Just throw the deuces up and move on with your life ‚Äì right? But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì when it comes to relationship abuse, it‚Äôs never as easy as ‚Äújust leaving.‚Äù We‚Äôre here to tell you why. Leaving an abusive relationship is hard for many reasons. Here are 11 of the many reasons that someone in an unhealthy or toxic situation might stay with their partner. Image Credit: Jetty Images/Shutterstock. 1. Society normalizes unhealthy behavior so people may not understand that their relationship is abusive. When you think that unhealthy or abusive behaviors are normal, it‚Äôs hard to identify your relationship as abusive and therefore there‚Äôs no reason to seek help. 2. Emotional abuse destroys your self-esteem, making it feel impossible to start fresh. Oftentimes, people in emotionally abusive relationships may not understand that they are being abused because there‚Äôs no violence involved. Also, many will dismiss or downplay emotional abuse because they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as physical abuse. It‚Äôs hard for those in abusive relationships to leave their partners after they‚Äôve continuously been made to feel worthless and like there‚Äôs no better option for themselves. 3. The Cycle of Abuse: after every abusive incident comes a make-up honeymoon phase. Often when an abusive situation happens, it is followed by the abuser doing something nice or apologizing and promising that they will never do it again. This makes their partner minimize the original abusive behavior. 4. It‚Äôs dangerous to leave. Like, VERY dangerous. Many times, leaving an abusive relationship is not only emotionally difficult, but can also be life-threatening. In fact, the most dangerous time in an abusive relationship is post break-up. Women are 70 times more likely to be killed in the weeks after leaving their abusive partner than at any other time during the relationship. 5. It‚Äôs not just hard to breakup safely, it‚Äôs also hard to escape the cycle of control. People in abusive relationships often attempt to break up with their partner several times before the break up sticks. On average, a person in an abusive relationship will attempt to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good. People in abusive relationships often attempt to break up with their partner several times before the break up sticks. On average, a person in an abusive relationship will attempt to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.2 6. Society perpetuates a ride-or-die mindset. Those in unhealthy or abusive relationships might stay with their partner or get back together after a break up because they feel pressure to not give up, forgive and forget or ‚Äúride it out.‚Äù Pop culture glamorizes being a ‚Äúride-or-die‚Äù for your friends and partner, making people out to be in the wrong for leaving their partner. And while being loyal is a great thing, a good friend or partner would never endanger or hurt you. 7. They feel personally responsible for their partner or their behavior. After a conflict, an abuser will turn the situation around and make their partner feel guilty or as though they are somehow at fault. This type of behavior is known as [LINKED_TEXT: gaslighting] [URL: https://www.joinonelove.org/7_signs_of_gaslighting]. 8. They believe that if they stick it out, things might change. A lot of people in abusive relationships stay in them because they love their partner and think that things will change. They might also believe their partner‚Äôs behavior is due to tough times or feel as though they can change their partner if they are a better partner themselves. Never stay in a relationship in which you count on someone to change their behavior for the better. 9. There is social pressure to be in a perfect relationship. There is incredible pressure to be in a perfect relationship, and some cultures and social media only accentuate this pressure. 10. Fear of how others will react. People in abusive relationships often feel embarrassed to admit that their partner is abusive for fear of being judged, blamed, marginalized, pitied or looked down on. For example, in some LGBTQIA* relationships, someone may stay with their partner for fear of being outed. 11. They share a life together. Marriage, children, and shared finances are often huge reasons that people in abusive relationships stay in them. This dependency is heightened in relationships where one partner is differently abled. But there are also similar factors that affect young people‚Äôs decisions to stay in relationships, including shared friend groups and living situations.

THANK YOU FOR A2A !!!! Here are some normal slip-ups which you need to evade for guaranteeing a remarkable passing of the [LINKED_TEXT: GATE Exam] [URL: https://www.exambazaar.com/exam/gate] Incorrect Study Material MISTAKES This is totally self-evident, you will pick up what your books will instruct. Along these lines, alluding to a wrong book will be the greatest mix-up for any test, not the only one GATE. SUGGESTIONS Continuously go for standard books. Search for suggested books by earlier years' toppers. Tune in to your training specialists about examination material and books. No Revision MISTAKES The majority of the hopefuls do this oversight. They simply read the theme on more than one occasion and after that don't contact it for an extended stretch of time. SUGGESTIONS Keep in mind when you see an inquiry, you know about the terms, however, don't know about the appropriate response. Indeed, you do recollect. This occurs because of the absence of correction. Thus, set aside a few minutes for the opportune update in your investigation plan. Lack of Time Management MISTAKES Understudies regularly whine about the time length of the test. They think that its lacking. Nonetheless, top scorers don't by and large don't have this issue. SUGGESTIONS The thing that matters is Practice. The individuals who practice plenty of taunt tests turn out to be great in time the executives and score high. Focus just on the Technical Section MISTAKE AND SUGGESTION GATE Exam is tiring for most of the areas just around the specialized area, for example, the subject they have chosen. They disregard to get ready for the General Aptitude and Mathematics area which is totally wrong as they have a proportion of 30% of the all-out imprints. Focus just on the Previous Years Papers MISTAKE Rehearsing earlier years' papers is an essential piece of GATE Exam planning yet concentrating simply on them isn't the correct procedure. SUGGESTION Do rehearse earlier years' papers yet think about books and other examination materials for progress. Study Late Night before Exam Day MISTAKE Truly, this is a typical error that a substantial number of understudies do. We realize you need to put forth a valiant effort and would prefer not to pass up any subjects. SUGGESTION In any case, for that, you should begin your readiness early. Awakening the entire night or late night before the test will make you feel drowsy and fretful in the test. Your mind will feel tired. Along these lines, it is encouraged to have great rest and eat well sustenance.

Something to put on and look dapper. I also believe in the power a watch has to amplify whatever statement you want your outfit to make. I don‚Äôt come from money, so for a long time, even now, I struggled with the mere idea of a Rolex. To add to it, the first Rollies I ever saw people wearing were these hyper-shiny, bedazzled abominations; so it wasn‚Äôt until recently that I discovered that every Rolex isn‚Äôt a rich snob‚Äôs wet dream, in terms of aesthetics or price. This is a Rolex I would gladly wear with a suit. To me, it says that I have a respect and appreciation for well-made watches, that I have the taste to wear such a watch to complement my attire, which will be simple, understated and elegant, and that I have the sense to stay away from some garish, overpriced foolishness. 6/11/18: Having learned a few more things about watches, and what I like in them, I‚Äôd wear a Sub with a business suit, if I were working or taking a meeting or some such. I prefer understated, so it would be black or blue. In more formal or casual settings, I wouldn‚Äôt go with a Sub; I‚Äôve heard it said that you aren‚Äôt supposed to wear a watch for these, but fuck that, I always wear one. Submariner wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice. I‚Äôd feel more comfortable with something sleeker; at the same time, my taste limits my options in Rolex wearables pretty severely.

The first benchmark test scores from a production iPhone 11 Pro were just discovered online, and they absolutely obliterate every single Android flagship phone on the market. Of all the things we‚Äôve learned about Apple‚Äôs next-generation iPhones over the past few days, this might actually be the least surprising. Apple‚Äôs iPhones get new A-series chipsets each year that offer significant performance gains, and the same can be said of the A13 Bionic chip that powers 2019‚Äôs iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Since there are no Android smartphones on the market right now that are even as powerful as Apple‚Äôs year-old iPhone XS, it certainly stands to reason that the new iPhone 11 Pro would outscore top Android flagships as well. Assumptions are one thing, but seeing actual benchmark scores is another. Now that iPhone 11-series review units are in the hands of early reviews from newspapers and blogs, benchmark test scores are beginning to pop up. Geenbench remains the best test by which all-around smartphone performance is measured, and it just so happens that a [LINKED_TEXT: Geekbench 4 score hit Geekbench‚Äôs website] [URL: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14601046] on Thursday morning. How did the new A13 Bionic-powered iPhone 11 Pro do? See for yourself: Last year‚Äôs iPhone XR achieved single-core scores in the 4700-4800 range, and the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max topped 5,000. As for multi-core scores, all three models reached the mid-11000s. This year‚Äôs iPhone 11 Pro shows modest gains with its single-core score of 5472, but the multi-core score of 13769 is off the charts. To put all this in perspective as it compares to the most powerful Android flagship phones out there right now, [LINKED_TEXT: the best Samsung‚Äôs brand new Galaxy Note 10+ can manage] [URL: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14601294] in the same Geekbench test is a single-core score of 3404 and a multi-core score of 10777. In other words, it‚Äôs not even close. No Android smartphone in 2019 will even come close to matching the new iPhone 11 series, and that should be fairly obvious at this point. What‚Äôs more, next year‚Äôs new Android flagships that are powered by next-generation processors from Qualcomm and Samsung likely still won‚Äôt approach the kind of performance we‚Äôre seeing from the new iPhone 11 Pro and its A13 Bionic chipset."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","output":"Have I got a joke for you?

Is it really profitable?","output":"Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn't keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the merchant never sees or handles the product. Benefits Less Capital Is Required ‚Äì Probably the biggest advantage to dropshipping is that it's possible to launch an eCommerce store without having to invest thousands of dollars in inventory up front. Traditionally, retailers have had to tie up huge amounts of capital purchasing inventory. With the dropshipping model, you don't have to purchase a product unless you already made the sale and have been paid by the customer. Without major up-front inventory investments, it's possible to start a successful dropshipping business with very little money. Easy to Get Started ‚Äì Running an eCommerce business is much easier when you don't have to deal with physical products. With dropshipping, you don't have to worry about: Managing or paying for a warehousePacking and shipping your ordersTracking inventory for accounting reasonsHandling returns and inbound shipmentsContinually ordering products and managing stock level Low Overhead ‚Äì Because you don't have to deal with purchasing inventory or managing a warehouse, your overhead expenses are quite low. In fact, many successful dropshipping businesses are [LINKED_TEXT: r] [URL: https://www.shopify.in/home-based-business]un from a home office with a laptop for less than 100 per month. As you grow, these expenses will likely increase but will still be low compared to those of traditional brick-and-mortar businesses. Flexible Location ‚Äì A dropshipping business can be run from just about anywhere with an internet connection. As long as you can communicate with suppliers and customers easily, you can run and manage your business. Wide Selection of Products ‚Äì Because you don't have to pre-purchase the items you sell, you can offer an array of products to your potential customers. If suppliers stock an item, you can list if for sale on your website at no additional cost. Easy to Scale ‚Äì With a traditional business, if you receive three times as much business you'll usually need to do three times as much work. By leveraging dropshipping suppliers, most of the work to process additional orders will be borne by the suppliers, allowing you to expand with fewer growing pains and less incremental work. Sales growth will always bring additional work ‚Äì especially related to customer service ‚Äì but business that utilize dropshipping scale particularly well relative to traditional eCommerce businesses.

What, you don't think the store actually pays for this, do you? What a scam you could run, delivering pizzas and saying the customer didn't pay. Unpaid orders come out of the driver's pocket, not the store's. I drove for one of the big chains about 10 years ago. We had a corporate policy forbidding the \\"30 minute guarantee\\" type of thing. Instead we offered coupons (good ones, you'd basically get your next order for less than half price) but we would never refund an order because it was late - if you didn't pay, your pizza went back to the store. The store would take the hit as long as we still had the pizza, so it was no skin off our backs if you refused payment, same as if you didn't answer the door. Plus I'd probably have half a dozen more orders in the car, so standing there arguing with you about payment was just not on the table. It went like this: \\"I'm not paying\\" \\"OK see ya *SLAM* *vrooom*\\" And I'd call the store on my way to the next order to let them know the situation, just in case you were thinking of calling to get a replacement order or something. Policy was that the store was to throw returned pizzas out, but usually we ate them instead. I never heard of it happening, but if you took the pizza and then refused to pay, the driver wouldn't try to get it back. But eat fast, because the police are on their way to pay you a visit that'll likely end with you in the back of a cruiser."},{"instruction":"Can somebody help me with the best endocrinologist in Mumbai for pcos?","output":"I am diagnosed with pcos from past seven years, I used to consult a gynaecologist for my irregular periods and now after my periods are normal I switched to endrocologist to check my hormonal imbalance.

Great planes as the other 3 were, they were pretty much the end of the line for conventional twin engined bombers with a self defence capability of manned gun positions. The Mosquito was the most significant design of bomber to emerge from WW2, as its approach of sacrificing defensive armament for speed has been adopted by many bomber designers post war. It also was a pioneer of the lightweight composite construction that practically all military offensive planes use today. The difference is only in the materials. Highly specified composite wood layers vs. Carbon fibre etc. I'd also say it wins as it was the best bomber bar none of WW2 from the crew casualty point of view. It dropped the highest weight of bombs per crewman lost of any bomber of the war, Allied or Axis. It was a completely divergent bomber concept from the heavily armed 4 engined ‚Äòheavies‚Äô, and it went so far against the grain of traditional bomber design, that the RAF were initially reluctant to accept its radical approach and capabilities. Fundamentally it was very fast, very light, carried its load further than the heavies and was unarmed. Fast because it was powered by two Rolls Royce Merlins similar to those used in the Spitfire, in a very streamlined design. Light because it was made from immensely strong ‚Äòcomposite‚Äô wood structures, typically special plies over a balsa core. Unarmed because it didn't need to be because of its speed. It could fly faster that the opposition fighters at the time it was introduced and was one of the fastest planes in the world at the time with a top speed of 410 mph. It was still fast by 1945 achieving speeds of 430 mph with later dual stage supercharged Merlins. And because of its light weight and the weight saved by not carrying guns or the crewmen to fire them, it could carry up to a 4000lb bombload deep into Germany at up to 35,000 ft. By the time the German interceptors had got to that height, the Mosquito was normally long gone. If it was caught, it's superior dive speed and controllability meant it could normally escape. It's wooden construction also meant it gave a much smaller radar reflection than a metal plane the same size. The first stealth bomber? But my main point is that the Mosquito turned out to be the first of its kind as the genesis of the modern fast unarmed bomber. Planes like the B-17, B-24, B-25, B-26, Ju88 were really the last of their lines. Yes there were later planes like the B-29 with remotely controlled turrets, but Curtis Le May had many stripped of thier guns to save weight, increase speed and bombload. Sound familiar? From that point on, most US bombers just retained the tail gunner, even on the mighty B-52. And even then those tail guns were removed from the B-52 in 1991. I'd contest that planes like the Canberra, F-117, B-47, Hustler, Valkyrie, B-2, Vulcan and Victor were all its design philosophy successors."},{"instruction":"the current Russia Ukraine situation similar to the BritainFalklands/Argentina situation under Margaret Thatcher?","output":"I see no resemblance here, unless Thatcher is Zelenskyy in this picture.

What are the things to remember before buying a CCTV camera for the whole home?","output":"When choosing CCTV cameras for a two-floor bungalow or the entire home, there are several factors to consider. Here are some things to remember before making a purchase: 1. Coverage Area: Assess the areas you want to cover with CCTV cameras. Determine the number of indoor and outdoor locations that require surveillance. Consider entry points, windows, driveways, and any vulnerable areas that need monitoring. 2. Camera Types: Select the appropriate camera types based on your needs. Dome cameras are discreet and suitable for indoor use, while bullet cameras are better suited for outdoor surveillance due to their weather-resistant design. Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras offer flexibility in adjusting the viewing angle. 3. Resolution and Image Quality: Higher resolution cameras provide clearer and more detailed images. For reliable identification of people and objects, consider cameras with at least 1080p Full HD resolution. If you require even greater detail, consider cameras with 4K resolution. 4. Night Vision Capability: Ensure that the CCTV cameras have good low-light performance or built-in infrared (IR) LEDs for night vision. This is essential for capturing clear footage in low-light conditions or complete darkness. 5. Storage Options: Determine how you want to store the recorded footage. Some cameras have built-in memory or support local storage options like SD cards, while others use network video recorders (NVRs) or cloud storage. Evaluate the storage capacity and choose an option that suits your needs. 6. Connectivity and Remote Viewing: Check if the cameras support Wi-Fi or wired connections. Wi-Fi connectivity offers flexibility during installation, while wired connections provide a more stable and reliable connection. Additionally, consider cameras that allow remote viewing via mobile apps or web browsers, enabling you to monitor your home from anywhere. 7. Motion Detection and Alerts: Look for cameras with motion detection capabilities that can send notifications or trigger recording when motion is detected. This helps reduce the amount of recorded footage and alerts you to potential security events. 8. Integration with Home Security Systems: If you have an existing home security system or plan to install one, ensure that the CCTV cameras can integrate with it. This allows for a more comprehensive security solution with centralized control and monitoring. 9. Brand Reputation and Reviews: Research reputable brands known for producing high-quality CCTV cameras. Read customer reviews and ratings to gauge the performance and reliability of the cameras you are considering. 10. Budget Considerations: Set a budget for your CCTV camera system and consider the cost of cameras, additional equipment (such as NVRs or cables), installation, and ongoing maintenance."},{"instruction":"The Hulk is meant to be a living embodiment of rage, but he constantly stats that he wants to be left alone.

I grew up in the country, and one of the things my brother and I did for entertainment was drive gravel roads in his rusty old Ford pickup drinking beer and enjoying the scenery. Occasionally we would spot an abandoned house, school or church and if it appeared safe and not too close to the road, we would hike to it and explore. We had no desire to steal or damage the property, but it was more out of boredom and curiosity. This was in the late 70‚Äôs, so most of the places were turn of the century buildings, simply constructed and long since abandoned as the farming communities that had previously supported them disappeared and nature slowly overtook the structures. Normally we would find old furniture, walls covered with newspapers that were decades old, and the occasional rat, possum, or feral cat that had taken up residence. On this particular night my brother said he knew of a place that he had always wanted to explore but hadn't because of the history of the area and its remote location (local ghost stories were always a factor with these places). I was intrigued and we headed out, getting there just as the sun began to set. The building was a single story one room church next to a small family graveyard with a rusty overgrown iron fence and no sign of maintenance for many years. It sat nearly a quarter of a mile from the rutted dusty road, probably a result of the road path changing as modern equipment allowed for a new low water bridge to be built across the nearby wet weather creek. We parked near the creek, grabbed an eight pack of pony Miller‚Äôs (don't judge us, craft beer hadn't been invented) and started to fight our way through the unmown field towards the building. By this time the sun was just over the treetops and the wind had died as early evening stillness set in. As we approached the building we could see that the weeds and some decorative bushes had grown wildly oversized and covered the building nearly to the top of the haphazardly boarded up windows . Whatever paint had been on the building had long faded, leaving it forlorn but oddly picturesque as we waded through the little cemetery to get to the front of the building. The double doors were closed, but hanging loosely on rusty hinges with a broken clasp that allowed us to easily push our way inside. I led the way and stepped quietly into the cool dark interior, lit only by a few shafts of fading sunlight peeking through a few broken boards. I paused to allow my brother to slip in beside me and we both took a moment to let our eyes adjust and scan the floor for weak spots and signs of a basement, having nearly fell through due to a lack of caution on previous adventures. There was no sound other than insects buzzing near the rafters, and as we looked around we saw a handful of simple wooden pews still in prim rows facing the raised platform in the front. A couple of old water damaged paintings of Jesus and Angels, common in these old churches, hung askew on the front wall facing the congregation, and the rusted remains of a pot belly stove was on the right side with a hole in the roof where the missing stovepipe had once been. We stepped forward down the center when we both saw it simultaneously. I heard my brother‚Äôs soft whistle as he drew in his breath near my shoulder, then his low whisper. ‚ÄúLook at that, Matt‚Äù. To the left of the front row and laying at an angle in front of the pews between the rustic altar and the raised platform was an open casket. Our eyes were transfixed on it as we walked closer, hearing the creaking boards of each step echo against the silent walls. He led as I held back, and exclaimed loudly ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been jimmied open with a crowbar‚Äù. I got near enough to see it and sure enough, the modern casket had obvious dents and scrapes where a tool had been used on the front right corner to pry it open. The satin padded interior was perfect except for stains where a body had once lain. The lid was still on its hinges, and the casket looked clean enough to see the simple nickel and brass ornaments with nothing but dust on the sides. I always carried a camera with film and fresh batteries since we often photographed our finds so I quickly took three or four pictures at different angles. We glanced around the rest of the building, saw nothing else of interest and looked at one another and I said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here‚Äù. We skedaddled to the truck in what was now a dark field, not even bothering to close the door behind us or worry about tripping over low headstones. I have no idea what had happened to cause that casket to be there, it was too new to be from the overgrown cemetery next to the church, and I've wondered many times since what story was behind it. I didn't develop the pictures until some months later but they were clear as a 35mm camera with a good flash normally takes, showing every detail. After showing them to my brother and discussing it again, we both agreed that old abandoned churches should be left alone. I shoved the photos in a box and haven't looked at them since, but now forty years later it still spooks me to think about it."},{"instruction":"w long does it take to verify a Payoneer account?","output":"The time it takes to verify a Payoneer account can vary.

It‚Äôs understandable; in the early days graphics were so bad that ANY trick that made for better graphics was seized upon. The full 3D animation in Wolfenstein 25 years ago was revolutionary. And so game designers have fixed on graphics as the sine qua non of game design. The problem is that they‚Äôre already near the limit. If you‚Äôve got 99% accuracy, what‚Äôs the point of spending years of effort to reach 99.5%? We‚Äôve had the perfect example of the flaw in the thinking for 15 years now. Two movies came out the same summer: Shrek and Final Fantasy. The latter included the pinnacle of graphics technology. The creators of Final Fantasy boasted that their model of the heroine had 3,000 separate hairs. But contrast, Shrek didn‚Äôt have any hair. The graphics quality was abysmal compared to Final Fantasy. The designers concentrate on facial expression and on the story, not graphics. Compare the high-quality graphics of Final Fantasy with those of Shrek. Now look at the emotional content. Final Fantasy: dead. Shrek: bursting with life. Result: Shrek outsold Final Fantasy 10 to 1, spawned more movies, and a whole range of secondary products. Why? The answer is simple: ‚ÄúPeople, not things!‚Äù Shrek was about people: their feelings, their relationships, their changes. Final Fantasy was about things. When game designers start tackling the problems required to realize ‚ÄúPeople, not things!‚Äù, they‚Äôll learn that these problems are immensely more difficult than anything they‚Äôve ever encountered in conventional game design. Which is one reason why so little progress has been made on the problem."},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

I never saw it coming. At first he‚Äôd be gone for a day or a night. He‚Äôd return telling no tales. Eventually, his disappearances started lasting longer, but never more than a couple days. I assumed he had a wild streak and enjoyed adventure. Then he disappeared. Days passed. I put up signs, looked through the cages at the Humane Society, was amazed by how many cats looked almost-but-not-quite like him. He returned in a rainstorm at 3 a.m. - a sodden, pitiful bundle scratching at my door. He‚Äôd been gone seven days. Trapped in a garage, I thought, or treed by a coyote. I hugged him and told him he was safe. He purred. I got him chipped after that, and put a collar on him. He kept up his wandering ways. It was a couple weeks later that I got a call from a woman two streets over, asking did I know my cat haunted her porch. ‚ÄúHe started coming around a year ago and I put out Fancy Feast for him. Since then, he comes every morning and evening for a meal, and lounges on the porch or naps under the shrubs. My daughter loves him.‚Äù I googled her house. By car it was over a mile. By cat-foot it could be reached by prowling across three backyards, leaping two fences, and creeping through a stand of trees. He lost interest in coming home. I would drive to my neighbor‚Äôs house every evening to bring him in for the night. He‚Äôd snuggle beside me, enjoying indoor luxuries and human companionship. But every morning before sunrise he would wake me by yowling at my back door to demand his freedom. I‚Äôd watch him dash out to dine al fresco on my rival‚Äôs porch. One evening when I went to pick him up, he trotted away from me. I pursued, but he dodged through her shrubs where I couldn‚Äôt follow. When I withdrew and sat in my car, he emerged and struck a regal pose on her front steps. I walked toward him again - and again he shrank back. From beneath a thicket of juniper, he gazed out at me warily. I had become a meddling interloper who pulled him away from the place he was happiest. My warm and sheltering home, where he had always slept on my chest all night and licked my face and been safe from bad weather and eaten kibble without complaint, was now merely a feline detention center. He preferred his bed of leaves under the stars. Even in downpours and snowfall and hundred-degree heat, he no longer came home by choice. The neighbor started driving him back to me herself - but he had to be lured into her arms and wrestled into the car. I started offering him Fancy Feast, which he ate happily, but still he went back to her. I asked the neighbor to stop feeding him, but I think she didn‚Äôt have the heart to turn him away. This past summer, I didn‚Äôt see him for three months. My neighbor kept me updated. ‚ÄúHe sleeps under my rhododendrons all day.‚Äù I drove by once to put his flea medicine on him, and found him reclining like a lord atop a stack of mulch bags - but he backed away when I approached. I gave the flea medicine to my neighbor. There was a scrappy black-and-white cat who liked to mix it up with him, my neighbor said. One day in late summer, she called to tell me my cat had gotten an eye injury. I was at work so she took him to my vet. After that, I kept him inside for a week - putting ointment on the eye and medicine in his food. He did not yowl at the door any more. He seemed grateful to be under a roof. The eye got worse; the vet recommended enucleation. After the operation I kept him inside in an e-collar for two more weeks. I reminded him that the world outside was full of danger. I gave him Fancy Feast, sweet words, a warm lap, attention. I showed him the vet bill. He lay on my bed and purred. He had lost an eye, but had learned to love me again. The day I took the collar off, he went to my back door, turned his one luminous golden eye on me - and started yowling. What could I do? I let him out. He shot across the grass and over the fence. I texted my neighbor that he was on his way."},{"instruction":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, ‚ÄúNope, not worth it‚Äù and just left?","output":"Not myself but one of my partners on the Chicago Police department told me of the summer night he was working alone and patrolling a lonely side street around 2 am.

Charles Bukowski...http://the-big-ger-picture.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-donald-trump-effect-why-self.html] [URL: http://the-big-ger-picture.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-donald-trump-effect-why-self.html]The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence. Charles Bukowski Our internal states like happiness are evolutionarily programmed to lead us in decision-making. They are gages that measure external input and compare it to pre-programmed values in order to check if things are going right. Happiness (life satisfaction) measures the overall course, like a sat nav that tells us we are on the right way. Self-confidence is a bit harder to understand. It should measure our social standing as a sociometric gauge. In a way, it reflects our popularity, which from an evolutionary point of view depends more on competence and status for men (provisioning profile) and more on social integration (pro-social profile) for women. What we often find in reality is, however, that less competent people are more self-assured and have more self-confidence than more competent (see Bukovski quote above). This effect is called the Dunning-Kruger effect. WTF is going on here? A measuring instrument that does the opposite of what it is supposed to do? It‚Äôs unreliable for both the individual and as a social cue for others. Of course, evolution would allow for some ‚Äúfreeloading‚Äù and ‚Äúfake it until you make it‚Äù stuff here, but the percentage of such fakers could never be high and yet the Dunning-Kruger effect seems to be the rule rather than the exception. One is certainly reminded of a recent American president here. An incompetent president rules with high self-confidence while at the same time it is common among highly competent American college professors to suffer from imposter syndrome. Where does this confusion come from? Evolution didn‚Äôt make a mistake here. I have argued that our minds are derived from three different evolutionary tribes: foragers, farmers and pastoralists. The majority of academics belong to the forager type. Considering that autism runs more frequently in families of academics, it is not very surprising that many academics are socially awkward themselves and therefore feel socially more inept and less confident. But why should they also feel more insecure when it comes to their competence? Exactly because they are forager types, who are highly egalitarian. In forager societies individuals who are feeling better than the rest are typically ridiculed, which is a very serious matter in forager societies as this is the last stage before ostracism which comes down to saying goodbye to your reproductive potential. So, sudden success may hit a forager type unexpectedly and it may take a long time for self-esteem to catch up with the real competence. The second most popular TED Talk of all times is by Amy Cuddy, in which she tells us that we can feel more self-confident and powerful just by power-posing and repeating the mantra ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù. Her ideas have been disproven, by the way, and yet people love watching her video. This fake it till you make it philosophy may be very useful for forager types with low self-confidence. It hardly would have made Trump a more competent president though, even if he had served for another term. Can we have too much self-confidence? Well, yes of course. Self-confidence should be a reliable measure of competence. If I ride a motorbike and I have too much confidence the risk of having an accident increases. American kids are the ones who have the highest self-confidence levels in the world, while consistently scoring low on international rankings for educational attainment. The situation is reversed in many Asian countries. Could it be that American parents have been instilling too much self-confidence into their kids? Teens who are too self-confident are often at risk of performing poorly or even dropping out of school (the Donald Trump effect). We don‚Äôt want our kids to grow up with super big egos, but with healthy self-esteem. For many forager-type kids that is very hard anyway. As I have argued many of them are found among neurodiverse children (ASD, ADHD, gifted, geeks, etc.) for whom it is nearly impossible to grow up with healthy self-confidence. Many of them get bullied, and even if they don‚Äôt get bullied they often grow up as outsiders, all of which take a huge toll on their self-confidence. Interestingly, Trump kept referring to how much people like him more often than to how competent he was. An indication that his evolutionary profile is ironically rather pro-social than provisioning. This is somewhat hard to believe for someone who treated both his staff and his family in a quite antisocial way. We don‚Äôt want to subscribe to a general ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù mantra, but achieve realistic self-confidence levels. Everyone would benefit from that."},{"instruction":"Why is the electrical conductivity of ZnO hard to control?","output":"Zinc Oxide has a tendency to shed oxygen at fairly low temperatures and this changes the conductivity through oxygen depletion doping. It is possible to positively dope zinc oxide by changing the ratio of zinc to oxygen unintentionally through this mechanism. In addition it is not possible to negatively dope zinc oxide with excess oxygen because the zinc doesn‚Äôt have a +3 valence state. This means that negative doping has to come from a different species which changes the crystal lattice parameters. This can cause strain doping where the displacement of an atom from the crystal creates a ‚Äúhole‚Äù. Both of these mechanisms are hard to control and this makes zinc oxide a challenging semiconductor material but it is extremely cheap so it is worthwhile to investigate and it does have some commercial uses."},{"instruction":"f life grew out of organic sludge, why haven't we seen another example of that kind of creation?","output":"Really?

Urologists are specialized medical professionals who diagnose and treat conditions related to the urinary tract and male reproductive system. While some urological issues may not require immediate attention, certain situations warrant urgent medical care. This post aims to shed light on some of the emergency situations that necessitate seeing a urologist promptly. 1. Acute Urinary Retention: Acute urinary retention is a sudden and painful inability to urinate, and it requires immediate medical attention. It can be caused by various factors, such as an enlarged prostate, kidney stones, or urinary tract infections. If you experience the inability to urinate along with severe discomfort or pain, seek immediate care from a urologist or visit the nearest emergency department. 2. Hematuria (Blood in Urine): The presence of blood in the urine, known as hematuria, can be a sign of several urological conditions, including kidney stones, urinary tract infections, or even bladder cancer. If you notice blood in your urine, especially if it is accompanied by pain, see a urologist promptly for evaluation and appropriate management. 3. Testicular Torsion: Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that occurs when a testicle twists on its spermatic cord, cutting off its blood supply. This condition causes severe pain and swelling in the scrotum. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to testicular damage or loss. If you experience sudden and intense testicular pain, seek immediate medical attention from a urologist or go to the emergency room. 4. Kidney Stone Complications: If you have a history of kidney stones and experience symptoms like severe flank pain, fever, chills, or difficulty urinating, it could indicate kidney stone complications. Complications such as kidney infection or blockage may require urgent intervention. Contact a urologist to address the issue promptly. 5. Priapism: Priapism is a persistent and painful erection that lasts for several hours and is not related to sexual arousal. This condition requires urgent medical attention to prevent potential damage to the penile tissue. If you experience priapism, seek immediate care from a urologist or visit the emergency department. Scientific Studies References: Urology Journal (2019) - Title: \\"Management of Acute Urinary Retention: A Global Perspective\\"Journal of Urology (2020) - Title: \\"Evaluation of Hematuria in Adults\\"European Urology Focus (2019) - Title: \\"European Association of Urology Guidelines on Priapism\\"European Urology (2021) - Title: \\"Diagnosis and Acute Management of Initial and Recurrent Kidney Stones\\"Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020) - Title: \\"Testicular Torsion: A Literature Review\\" Urological emergencies require prompt medical attention to avoid potential complications and ensure the best possible outcomes. If you encounter any of the mentioned emergency situations or experience severe pain, bleeding, or sudden changes in urinary or reproductive function, do not hesitate to contact a urologist or seek immediate medical care. Early intervention is crucial in managing urological emergencies effectively and preserving urological health.

But as someone who has spent quite a bit of time on this issue through my involvement with my neighborhood association, here are my thoughts. I think there are multiple reasons and they vary by property and by the property owner. Some owners are making plenty of money from the residential units upstairs and so renting the ground-floor commercial space just isn‚Äôt a big priority for them. Apparently the additional monthly income they could get isn't sufficient to motivate them to action. I have trouble understanding this attitude, but maybe some of them are so wealthy that an extra few thousand dollars per month isn‚Äôt significant to them. Others are greedy and are holding out hoping for a big national chain to rent their space for top dollar. They‚Äôre telling themselves that they‚Äôll make more money over the long run once that juicy high-paying Starbucks (or whatever) comes along. This is not a very smart choice, particular since chain stores are more difficult to gain approval for in SF and many neighborhoods fight against them. And as space sits empty month after month, the rent which is forfeited through vacancy undoubtedly exceeds whatever extra money the chain store might bring in. Many older, smaller buildings with retail space may have been held in the same ownership or the same family for a long time, and the owners may be elderly and not focused on getting space rented, or ownership may have passed to distant family members who are similarly not paying much attention. That‚Äôs a problem that might be reduced through better enforcement of existing SF laws requiring registration of vacant commercial space and the paying of fees for vacant space. That law exists but isn‚Äôt enforced and needs more teeth. I think that more pressure ‚Äî through fines/fees, stepped-up building code enforcement on vacant storefronts, etc. ‚Äî is needed to make it more difficult for building owners to simply allow retail space to languish and sit empty. We need to make it at least mildly painful for owners to allow space to sit empty, and that will incentivize them to lower their asking prices and fill the spaces."},{"instruction":"What do you think of PyTorch compared to TensorFlow?","output":"I use theano for everyday work, so you can consider my opinion unbiased here ;) (also that I have only used these frameworks for writing just a small set of algorithms disqualifies me from commenting on production performance). Tensorflow looks and feels very much like theano the last time I tried it. I think it will be huge in future given the traction its already getting. Its also Python wrapped like theano and hence is very easy to integrate in the same service or as new service, if your web backend is in python. It seems to have a harder learning curve for a beginner (also its APIs kept changing till sometime back which makes it slightly harder). I think google has plans to integrate it on Android, which will make it available for direct phone deployment. Torch is easier to get started with. I earlier used to complain about the lack of tutorials in it, but now there is a good official one and there is a good course in form of PDFs (from Oxford if I am not wrong). It has a webservice library to host ML models as a separate microservice.

The Kobayashi Maru isn't testing the Cadet's competence. It's testing their character. The instructors want to see how their students react when presented with a situation where failure is inevitable. And there is literally nothing you could do that would result in you failing a test like that. You could... Refuse to take it.Forget to set your alarm and sleep through it.Self destruct the ship five seconds in. ...And all of these would be considered passing, because it would still tell the people administering the exam exactly what they were trying to learn. The cadets that get hung up on the test do so because they are too obsessed with proving their technical competence to consider that competence alone doesn't make a good Captain. Which, once again, is a valid result. Data almost certainly was subjected to a variety of these tests before being allowed up graduate even if he never had reason to take the Kobayashi Maru itself. And I'm sure the results of those tests would have caused a great deal of debate on how one teaches effective leadership to a being with overwhelming intelligence and no emotional awareness to speak of. If I had to guess based on how Data was presented in season one they would probably be most concerned with making sure he wasn't so scrupulous in his adherence to regulations that he couldn't handle a scenario where they happened to be in conflict. ‚Ä¶But based on that we saw in ‚ÄúPeak Performance,\\" he'd probably end up being one of the obsessive cadets who took the thing multiple times trying to improve his score."},{"instruction":"What solutions should never be used to clean a flat TV screen?","output":"The short answer is that any cleaner safe for soft plastics is fine for TV screens.

Any cleaner that gets below the bezel will work it‚Äôs way into the bonded address interface boards at the bottom of the screen and attack the ribbons and boards. Many people discover several weeks after they clean the screen they start to get lines in the picture, or smearing, or image persistence, etc. Once the ribbons or address boards are damaged, the TV is junk.

He knew his strengths, he knew his opponent‚Äôs weaknesses. STAVKA expected him to retreat to a very logical defensive position along the Dnieper. Manstein knew that STAVKA possessed this knowledge, so he determined to turn that knowledge against them. He counter-attacked, instead of withdrawing to the defensive. And his courage was correct. The Longer Answer: With the collapse at Stalingrad, Stalin believed he could achieve an even greater encirclement that would move west through Kharkov, reach the Dneiper & then strike south to the Black Sea near the Crimea - Manstein‚Äôs army group would be cut off, east of the Dneiper, & Kleist‚Äôs army group, farther south, would also be cut off. It would be a master stroke covering six hundred miles, & isolating two complete army groups - & leaving Army Group Centre ‚Äúhanging in mid-air.‚Äù On February 6, 1943, Manstein flew to the Wolf‚Äôs Lair & argued with Hitler for hours, until Hitler agreed to a major withdrawal & re-configuration of the German forces that were under this massive Soviet threat. Manstein was convinced that Stalin thought the Germans must need to retreat to save themselves - so Manstein determined to do exactly what Stalin did not expect - to counterattack. On February 17, 1943, Hitler flew to Manstein‚Äôs HQ & again argued for defensive action - & again Manstein won. Paul Hausser‚Äôs SS Panzer Corps in the north near Kharkov drove south, & what remained of the regular panzer divisions in the south attacked north. The SS Panzer Corps contained the elite of the Waffen SS - Das Reich, Totenkopf, & Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler. By February 28, 1943, the Germans had regained their positions along the Donets River which they had abandoned in January, 1943. The German advance continued northwards, led by the SS Panzer Corps. By March 15, 1943, Kharkov had been recaptured. And, had the German strength been sufficient, the Panzers might have been able to continue rolling northwards to that other fateful name - Kursk - which was about 120 miles north east of Kharkov. The Panzer Corps reached Belgorod, about 90 miles from Kursk, collapsed the Russian bridgeheads there, & halted their advance - the spring mud had arrived. Had the panzers reached Kursk in March, the result might have been very different than in July ‚Ä¶ Conclusion: The immense threat which had been faced by the Germans in February had now turned into the immense threat which the Soviets faced in March. In 4 weeks, STAVKA had suffered: their (ironically named) Sixth Army smashed; Popov‚Äôs Armoured Group, annihilated; Third Tank Army, numbers on a sheet of paper; Sixty-Ninth Army, scattered & incapable of action: 27 infantry divisions & brigades lost, 25 armoured brigades lost. Soviet losses: 88,649 ‚Ä¶ German losses: 11,500 according to Wikipedia. At Kharkov, Manstein had beaten the Soviets, because he had beaten Hitler first. At Kursk, Manstein might have beaten the Soviets again, but this time Hitler was determined not to be beaten, so Manstein lost, & Stalin ‚Ä¶ won. Recommended Reading: Carell, Paul.

These industries often require a constant stream of new leads to grow their businesses and stay ahead of the competition. Now, finding a niche can be a bit of a challenge, but it's definitely doable. Here are a few steps to help you out: 1. Research and analyze: Start by researching different industries and markets to identify potential niches. Look for sectors that have a gap or an underserved audience that you can target. 2. Identify your passion and expertise: Think about your own interests and skills. What areas are you passionate about? What are you knowledgeable in? Finding a niche that aligns with your expertise will make it easier for you to connect with your target audience. 3. Evaluate the competition: Check out what your competition is doing in the potential niches you've identified. Are there already established players? Can you offer something unique or better? Assessing the competition will help you determine if a niche is worth pursuing. 4. Test and refine: Once you've chosen a niche, start testing your marketing strategies and lead generation techniques. Monitor the results, collect feedback, and be open to making adjustments and refinements along the way. Remember, finding the right niche takes time and experimentation. Don't be afraid to pivot if something isn't working out. Stay focused, be persistent, and keep refining your approach.

I had a habit of coming to work at least an hour early. I liked to be alone for a bit and catch up on the never ending pile of mortgage and loan demands. It was an early morning in late August, I believe. It had rained heavily most of the night and it was still raining a bit when I arrived at work. Also, the branch I was stationed at was at the corner of a busy intersection on the East end of Ottawa. Also, please note that this was in the early nineties and cell phones were not the norm. ( I do not remember if anyone had one back then. I didn‚Äôt have one.) Also, repairs were being done on the roof of the building. The branch was a small building.

As I am listening, they are all getting closer and I realize that they are all coming towards me. Then I got nervous. What was going on? Finally, a police officer runs to me and tells me to follow him. By this time, the ambulance, police and firefighters were on the scene. The ambulance guys asked me if I was OK. I was fine I told them, Apparently, I could have gotten electrocuted because electricity and water do not mix well. ( I know‚Ä¶ What was I thinking! ) When they explained that, my knees started initially to feel jello and I also became slightly dizzy. It never dawned on me to also consider that.

Yet the tragedy of our time is that these Democrats are being betrayed by their own party, by imposters who pretend to be Democrats but are not.

If she had succeeded in all of her scheming we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about the Roman Empire today. We‚Äôd be saying the Egyptian Empire. Cleopatra planned to use Marc Antony to bring about a shift in the Roman order. Antony was prepared to suggest that the Roman Republic change seats in favor of Alexandria as it‚Äôs new center - an idea which did have it‚Äôs advantages, it should be noted. Egypt was something like the bread and precious metals basket of the Roman Republic, so it would not have been a terrible move.

These mistakes develop from either wrong information or preparatory mistakes the candidate makes while getting ready to write the exam. Choosing a section to answer based on opinions. A very common mistake while preparing for the GATE exam is choosing a section to answer first based on the opinions of other candidates or people. Every candidate has different strengths and weaknesses. Planning according to their strengths may cause differences in tackling the GATE exam paper. Choosing a question set in the paper in which the candidate is confident is key. Play according to your strengths. Lack of Deep Learning Strategies. A preparation strategy lacking focus and practice will only result in not meeting the GATE score expectations. Only when you solve 20 to 30 questions of the same concept will you have the ability to understand a specific concept. Exploring different ideas from different parts of the syllabus and regular practice can help you increase your knowledge of the subject. Missing out on good Mentorship. One of the most important aspects of cracking the GATE exam is learning from an experienced faculty. Many students opt not to undergo GATE coaching because they think it is not effective or simply because they think it‚Äôs expensive. If you look at the competition for the limited seats, it would be wise for the candidate to enroll in a good GATE coaching class. Casual Training Methods. Taking studies seriously for three days and then relaxing for a week is not an applicable plan. A candidate should give importance to the GATE exam while training for it. The GATE exam is a very technically dense paper. There needs to be a concrete study plan. There should also be a proper time management system to support your study. Improper Revision. If the candidate has no set revision plan before the exam, the end results may not be up to his/her expectations. The brain retains what is done consistently with repetition. A candidate should revise his studies daily to remember important terms and formulas. He can make short notes and read them at the end of the day before going to sleep. These are a few mistakes that a candidate should avoid while preparing for the GATE exam. If you have any queries or confusion drop a comment below. We will get back to you at the earliest.

However, by then, productive land was concentrated in the hands of a few. It made sense to let those few powerful landowners served as their own local government and then control them. When the invaders took over, it was a very easy model to follow. All the invader had to do was knock off the landowner and replace him with your own man. Those bonded to the landed did as they did before but the person they served changed. For those, the faces changed but the game remained the same. So, when the ‚Äúempire collapse,‚Äù the vast majority of the population did not know or care since they had long since been distant from any real decision making or independent law. They served the lord of the area, he was the law and they served him. Manorialism is a very easy model of local control. The barbarians readily picked it up. They were the warrior, legal, taxation authority, etc. The only issue was how much taxes the landowner paid to the guy at the very top and when he had to fight for that person."},{"instruction":"w do I talk like a native English speaker?","output":"The first step is: learn to talk in English in the way native speakers talk. We used to think native speakers used grammar rules (syntax) and plugged words into them to compute sentences as they speak. And that‚Äôs exactly how most people are still learning English as a second language. But that never really made much sense, because we shouldn‚Äôt be able to speak as quickly and with as few errors as we do. Grammar also can‚Äôt explain why we sound so natural when we speak (it‚Äôs ‚Äògood morning‚Äô, not ‚Äòpleasant first half of the day‚Äô). When we speak a language, we‚Äôre actually speaking in chunks. Phrases and expressions ‚Äì big pieces of language. Native speakers store chunks in memory, and then just pull them out as-is when they speak. There are no rules or individual words ‚Äì so no computation is necessary most of the time. And this is why native English sounds so fluent and natural. It‚Äôs why we can speak so fast, and why we speak so naturally.

This pain affects your daily life. However, there are several ways to manage & prevent it, such as: Physical Therapy: Physical therapy is one of the effective & first-line treatments for lower back pain. A physical therapist can provide a personalized therapeutic exercise program that strengthens your lower back muscles, condition the spinal tissues & joints & improves your flexibility. This can help reduce pain & prevent future episodes.Medication: Over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help decrease inflammation & pain. If these do not work, your physician may prescribe stronger medications. Note individuals with lower back pain should cautiously use prescription medications since they may cause adverse effects & dependence.Heat & Cold Therapy: Applying heat to the affected area can help relax the muscles & improve blood flow, which can reduce pain, promote healing & relieve stiffness. While cold therapy (ice therapy) can help reduce inflammation & numb the area, providing relief & also decrease tissue damage.Lifestyle Changes: Maintaining a healthy weight, staying active (particularly activities that strengthen the core), & practicing good posture when sitting & standing can all help prevent lower back pain, & keep your back strong & flexible. Also, using proper techniques when lifting weighty objects, such as bowing at the ankles & keeping the spine upright. Avoid twisting motions when lifting heavy objects.Ergonomics: Ensure that your work environment provides back support. This includes having a chair with adequate back support, keeping your feet flat on the floor, & ensuring the computer monitor is at eye level.Alternative Therapies: Alternative therapies, such as back brace, acupuncture, massage, & yoga, can provide some individuals with relief from lower back pain. These can help reduce stress, enhance your flexibility, & strengthen your back muscles.Injections: In some cases (rarely), doctors might inject anesthetics or corticosteroids straight into the spinal canal. These prescribed injections can aid in the reduction of inflammation & pain.Surgery: In severe cases, a patient may require surgery. Usually, Surgery is consider only when all other treatments have failed, & the pain is causing quite a bit of trouble or disability. Managing lower back pain requires a combination of correct diagnosis, pain management techniques, & preventative measures. It's important to note that what works for one individual may not work for another, so it's essential to consult with Dr. Aashish Arbat, [LINKED_TEXT: Orthopedic Doctor in Pune] [URL: https://www.draashisharbat.com/], to determine the best treatment plan for you.

He ruled Wallachia (Tara Romaneasca) three times. The first and third times for only a couple of months. His longest reign, the second one, lasted only 6 years - 1456-1462. During this short period he managed a lot of things. The capital was changed to Bucharest, Romania's capital today, managed to decrease laziness and corruption (by a lot of unorthodox moves), increased the kingdom's stability against nobles, established a fairly good army and fought for his merchants' rights against those from Transylvania who were used to have monopolies in various areas. He is best known for fighting against the Turks. He refused to pay the tribute to the sultan and spent the money on building the army, fortresses, monasteries. When the sultan, Mehmed II, the one who conquered Constantinople, gathered an army to punish him, Vlad wasn't scared, despite the fact that the army he was facing was the 2nd largest army the sultan gathered after conquering Constantinople (present day Istanbul) in 1453. He knew he couldn't survive a classical battle and thus started a guerilla war. He was quite successful and would have been even more successful hadn't been for some of his captains lack of courage. Needless to say they paid for this. After the famous night attack upon the sultan's camp Mehmed escaped alive and withdrew from the kingdom, leaving the army and Vlad's brother to continue hostilities. Vlad asked for help from the Hungarian king who had received subsidies from the Pope to fight against the Turks. But Mathia spent the money for wars in German provinces and found excuses to catch and imprison Vlad for 12 years. Thus, the fight against the Turks ended. After his release Vlad fought for the Hungarian king in Serbia and reclaimed his throne before being killed, apparently by one of his noblemen while watching the aftermath of a fight against the Turks from a hill. He was winning the battle and left the scene to have a better view. For not giving up his identity, legacy, for not bending his head to anyone, despite the odds, Vlad is my national hero."},{"instruction":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school?

This in turn, allows him to predict the opponent‚Äôs next attack and counter it. On top of that he uses special Nunchuck style dual blades that make him seem like a combination between Elvis Presley and Bruce Lee. As for Blood demon art, that award goes to Enmu.

Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable?","output":"Do sunset towns still exist in America where only whites are allowed after dark? Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable? Yes. And yes. But had I seen this question before I read ‚Äú[LINKED_TEXT: Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism‚Äù ] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0743294483/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_zuQWBbA7PN753]two years ago, I would have thought, ‚ÄúOf course not! My mom once lived in one, as a child, in the deep south. But I‚Äôm in Wisconsin, in 2018!‚Äù After reading the book, though, I am ashamed of my assumptions. Especially, having grown up in Milwakukee ‚Äî statistically the most segregated city in the United States ‚Äî and having known and worked with black people all my life, without ever having realized how ubiquitous, and everlasting, ‚Äúsundown towns‚Äù really are. As much as we in the Midwest want to feel some moral superiority over the South (we were on the right side of the Civil War, after all!), most of us white people are clueless about the nuances of hidden racism, which can feel more threatening than the ‚Äúovert‚Äù kind. That much, I knew about. What I didn't know was that many, if not most, Midwestern towns and suburbs had unwritten rules against African-Americans owning or renting property through at least the 1970s. As the book explains, such a system wasn't necessary in the south; oddly, because slavery made whites more willing to at least hire blacks as servants, and live in close proximity with them. The issue was very specifically about the color of one‚Äôs skin, too, and not economic class ‚Äî as evidenced by the fact that even upper-class blacks (physicians, celebrities and the like) also could not buy or rent for any amount of money. Such unwritten laws in towns and suburbs of Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois had the effect of causing extreme race segregation in Milwaukee, Detroit and Chicago. They took a variety of forms, from actual ordinances, to discriminatory practices of Realtors, to pranks and intimidation of blacks who had moved into a neighborhood giving the message, ‚Äúyou aren't wanted here.‚Äù No, ‚Äúinner city blacks‚Äù did not move to the inner city because that's where the jobs were, but because such rules were harder to enforce in dense urban areas. At the same time, even low-quality housing in urban areas is usually more expensive than housing elsewhere. It‚Äôs just one of a hundred ways in which it is costly to be black. Today, communities that keep out, or drive out, blacks will now be called out. Equal housing laws are enforced. Does this mean the problem is behind us? Not hardly. In addition to all the challenges in housing, employment, education and the law that still affect low-income blacks disproportionately, I now understand how to label an anecdotal example regarding upper-income blacks: A friend and her husband immigrated from Ethiopia as teenagers. Both earned Master's degrees here. He is in technology, she is a medical professional, and they live with their twin boys in an upper-class suburb. The boys dark black skin, but were born here. They are culturally American, not African, nor even ‚ÄúAfrican-American.‚Äù (The photo above isn't them, but it might as well be.) The boys are 4.0 students, on the honor roll, in theater, in science club and in football. They happen to have been the only black kids in their elementary, middle and high school. They have never identified as ‚Äúblack,‚Äù not in speech, clothes, music or entertainment, and have never been in any sort of trouble. Yet freshman year, they were followed home repeatedly by patrol cars as they walked home from school. This finally stopped when a police officer actually stopped them and asked them where they lived. He chuckled when they pointed to an 800,000 on a cul-de-sac, and asked if he could meet their parents. My friend said the look of embarrassment on his face was obvious when she opened the door and his eyes met with hers. He told her he was sorry. He hadn't believed they really lived there.

Unfortunately it is NOT like the Movie CONTACT. Picking up Earth TV and Radio from Alpha Centauri (or visa versa with Arecibo would be very, very difficult. First, Arecibo collapsed a few years ago. However, there are other radio telescopes, including one in China slightly larger. The slaved Array radio telescopes such as the square Kilometer array in Australia and the Allen Array in California will be more capable than one large Arecibo dish and better than any one single dish, unless it was many miles across. However, the Allen Array likely will not be done till 2030, and the Very Large Array in Australia is due for completion in 2024 if they meet schedules. Here is what Arecibo can do with a real time message: Source ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Freq Range‚Ä¶ EIRP (effective power watts)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Detection Range AM Radio‚Ä¶.530- 1605 KHz‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 100KW to 500 KW ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 0.005 AU FM Radio‚Ä¶‚Ä¶88 - 108 MHz‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Earth Max of 5 Mega Watts‚Ä¶ 5.4 AU (Jupiter) UHF TV (Picture) 470- 806 MHz ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 5 MW‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 2.5 AU UHF TV Carrier ‚Ä¶. 470- 806 MHz‚Ä¶‚Ä¶5MW ‚Ä¶(threshold detect) 0.3 light years Military Radar‚Ä¶.

That 3 light years is real time. If post processing in done over a period of time (days) locked onto one star system, then that range can be doubled. Still, this only gets to the nearest five to ten stars, and radio telescopes do not have the time to focus on one star, because that‚Äôs not ‚Äúreal‚Äù radio astronomy, and SETI is NOT allotted priority. (The movie CONTACT got that part right). The good news is that in 2024, the SKA (Square Kilometer Array) in Australia and South Africa should be able to detect 5 MW TV carriers from 5 to perhaps 10 light years. Air Traffic control and military radars from 15 light years. That‚Äôs not till 2024. (If it is on schedule, and these things are usually delayed). SETI‚Äôs approach: They focus on S band around 2.2 to 2.4 GHz. They also think, or hope, or count on an ET transmitter being much more powerful than 5 MW. Although for use around one planet, or even in one solar system, there really is no need for more than 5 or 10 MW. However, assume ET builds transmitters that generate more power than our entire civilization. I don‚Äôt buy into that,, as it is not required for solar system interplanetary communications. However, if we up the power: (Arecibo detection ranges) Source ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Freq Range‚Ä¶ EIRP (effective power watts)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Detection Range S-Band ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 2.380 GHz ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 22 tera watts ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 720 light years S-Band ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..2.380 GHz ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 1 Giga watt (still more than we can do) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 8 Light years Power at 22 Terra watts is about the same as our entire civilization‚Äôs total electrical generating capacity. We could not build a transmitter that continuously operated at that power, even if we could generate that 22 terra watts continuously in one place‚Ä¶ However, even Arecibo could transmit a very narrow (a degree ) beam equivalent to an all directional transmitter of about 3 Terra watts. This was done in 1974. I strongly disagree with the target selection. The narrow beam was sent to the M13 Hercules Cluster, 25,000 light years away (which an Arecibo equivalent could theoretically detect from 25,000 light years away, 25,000 years from now, when the very faint signal reaches the M 13 cluster anyway. Carl Sagan and Frank Drake picked M 13 because the cluster of stars are close together; (about 2 light years apart). The transmission beam is so narrow, it won‚Äôt pass any star systems in the direction of M 13 for over 500 years. The detection range of a 3 TW signal for Arecibo is about 225 light years. It makes NO sense, that a group of closer stars were not selected. Carl Sagan, I am sure was aware of these detection issues. Why they did not decide on closer starts, like Eta Cassiopeiae A, Zeta Recticuli 2, Epsilon Erandi, etc, is very discouraging. Future scenario: ( Its 2033) The SKA or Allen Array detects an air traffic control radar like signal from Eplison Erandi 10.5 light years away. Even if the signal was authentic, it would take likely years of review to ‚Äúprove‚Äù it via the Scientific Method. Additionally, the burden of proof for such a thing would be higher than just the preponderance of evidence. ANY natural phenomenon that could even ‚Äúremotely be responsible‚Äù would be given a ‚Äúhigher consideration‚Äù. My advice: (Don‚Äôt Hold your breath). NOTE: Edited, the SKA (Square Kilometer Array) is a Very Large Array, but not to be confused with the VLA in New Mexico, which is smaller and less sensitive than the planned SKA (when it is complete)."},{"instruction":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","output":"Wherebeve got Adam to eat the forbidden fruit."},{"instruction":"a black Little Mermaid, an original Danish fairy tale, cultural appropriation?","output":"Is white Jesus, a supposedly real person form the near East, cu!rural appropriation?"},{"instruction":"What are some plastic surgery masterpieces?","output":"For reasons of trauma and or genetics, including aging, the science/art of aesthetic surgery can be a Godsend for those it could help.

What there hasn‚Äôt been is a compelling economic reason why more expensive, and more complicated thorium fuel cycles should be used. One of the most reckless claims is that thorium has nothing to do with nuclear weapons. On the contrary, the original motivation for employing thorium in nuclear reactors was for nuclear bombs. It has been known from the early days of nuclear fission that naturally occurring thorium may be converted into uranium-233, a strong nuclear explosive not present in nature, in the same manner that naturally occurring uranium can be turned into plutonium. In 1955, the United States exploded a nuclear weapon comprised of uranium-233 and plutonium-239. The Soviet Union detonated its first H-bomb (a thermonuclear weapon that uses both nuclear fusion and nuclear fission) in the same year, with a fissile core of natural uranium-235 and uranium-233. India tested a nuclear bomb with uranium-233 in 1998 as part of a series of nuclear test explosions that year. In 1994, the US government declassified a 1966 document stating that uranium-233 had been proved to be extremely satisfactory as a weapons material. Another frequently repeated absurd claim is that molten-salt reactors are an established technology. Throughout its four years of experimental operation, the Oak Ridge molten salt reactor underwent over 250 shutdowns, the majority of which were entirely unplanned. The molten-salt thorium fuelled experience at Oak Ridge 52 years ago - the only such experience accessible to date - consumed around one-quarter of the total budget of the whole Oak Ridge nuclear complex. It's difficult to see how anyone could interpret this trial as proving that such a device would be successful in a commercial setting. Thorium reactors, qualitatively, have the same safety issues as present nuclear reactors. The requirements for nuclear waste management and the risk for nuclear weapon proliferation are fundamentally the same - even though the details are far from identical. There is no qualitative difference in consequences in an accident as only off-site implications come from the inadvertent release of high-level radioactive material into the environment which is fundamentally the same for nuclear fuels. The one and only reason to pursue thorium as a nuclear fuel is in countries with poor domestic sources of uranium that wish to be self-sufficient in the area of nuclear fuels.

Having a best friend of the opposite gender is way better than having a boyfriend in many cases. He doesn't judge me, neither do I. We judge others together.He is the unbiological son of my parents, and I'm their unbiological second daughter(He has an older sibling).I can look like a homeless tramp with old pajamas on and undone hair shamelessly in front of him and still feel as much comfortable.I tell him to show up at my place out of the blue, and there he appears, without a question.He puts me first; even his girlfriend comes next, so the other friends he has are completely out of the scene.I'm his go to person even at 2 am, as much as he is to me.I'm the owner of most of the replies for screenshots sent by his girlfriend to him.(Sorry girl! She happens to be my best friend from childhood too, so I'm not afraid to mention it).I tend to think twice before telling him what to do and what not, when being confronted for advice/tips, because he does it accordingly without even demanding an explanation/justification.Most importantly, he's the best listener. Despite all the tips from him to move on and stay strong, I still lament at untimely hours and he becomes the epitome of patience.There's no unnecessary emotional drama, as it is with the girl squad.He's never left my side even at the extremest of mood swings; rather he understands that without me even having to tell and continues to be there even when I push him away.He's the first person to feel terribly happy when something good happens to me, and the first person to break down more than me when I'm low. It's been almost 13 years since I met this absolutely wonderful person, and this poor guy's fate is such that he's got to be stuck with me till the end of eternity. The biggest critic; yet my pillar of support and the greatest motivator, and at times, my driver. Words are insufficient to explain how much he means to me and still would. All that I‚Äôm able to say is that, he‚Äôs a blessing from above. P.S. This was his Whatsapp status on his birthday this year. 15/07/2018.

I think any decent public school (decently funded and managed) can get a child ready for college if that child is decently motivated and has decent parental guidance. A private school kid may have a potentially more streamlined educational path, and their parents may feel more ‚Äúin control‚Äù knowing their kid is surrounded by other likeminded parents‚Äô kids. A public school kid (like myself) will have had a broader childhood experience interacting with more types of people and perspectives, and may have to be more personally responsible for doing well, given that some of their friends may not be held to equal standards. In the end, neither type of school guarantees a student will do well or poorly, that will come down to personal (not their classmates‚Äô) effort and both teacher and familial guidance. Colleges know that well rounded, interesting, motivated, thoughtful, ‚Äúcollege ready‚Äù students come from all walks of life, and develop through a wide range of positive and negative experiences.

What zoom should I go to for nebulas?","output":"The word you want is ‚Äúmagnification‚Äù; zoom means variable magnification. 300X is pushing the limits of atmospheric steadiness; on most nights 300x will simply look all swimmy. With a large enough telescope and good seeing, 300x is sometimes useful for close double stars, fine planetary and lunar details, and very small deep-space targets. With telescopes smaller than about 10‚Ä≥ aperture, that much magnification mostly makes things look grainy and dim. For nebula observing, you should have a variety of eyepieces, as nebulae come in all sizes. Large diffuse nebulae are generally easier to see at lower power, tiny planetaries need higher power. And, unless you or you go-to scope are particularly good at zeroing in on things, it‚Äôs always easier to locate at low power and then choose a suitable eyepiece to study the object with. What actual powers work best also depends on the size of your telescope; 125x is high power for a 70mm scope, but only moderate for a 12‚Ä≥. Because of that, I find it more natural to think in terms of eyepiece focal length rather than the magnification when I‚Äôm observing."},{"instruction":"the Supermarine Spitfire still airworthy today?","output":"There are some around - but those that actually fought in WW2 are pretty rare.

Here are some important tidbits that may clear things up While Parthia had better cavalry they were outmatched militarily. The Romans were the undisputed masters of traditional man vs man warfare. In the open field, Rome was still practically unbeatable. The only way to beat the Romans was to try something tricky or ambush themRoman failures against Parthia boil down to poor generalship. Crassus handled his campaign like an idiot and Antony left his supply train at risk. A capable general was more than able to defeat a cavalry-centric army. Rome dealt with cavalry it‚Äôs entire existence. The Gauls, Germans, Carthaginians, Numidians, and Macadonians all fielded exceptional cavalry forces. Rome was no stranger to fighting cavalry. Here is the thing- cavalry isn‚Äôt all that great. It is often misunderstood to be something like a Medieval Knight. There were significant drawbacks Stirrups were not yet a thing so a heavy cavalry charge straight into an enemy formation meant that the rider was going to fall off the horse. Very few cavalry forces could fight head-on- they had to go around the sides, attack skirmishers, or something to that effectCavalry was expensive. A man can be trained to hold a shield and spear in a few days while it takes years to train a proper cavalry force. Not to mention the cost of feeding and maintaining horses cost additional resources.Once you let the cavalry go, it's gone. If your cavalry force is engaged against an enemy formation you cannot recall them to go somewhere else. You could play your cavalry card once and only once. Infantry on the other hand can be recalled and moved all aroundCavalry isn‚Äôt all that fast. They can outrun infantry if organized but we are talking tens of thousands of riders here. Infantry often and easily caught up to cavalry and had the advantage in melee brawls. So while the Parthians look really good they really weren‚Äôt. This isn‚Äôt to say Parthia didn‚Äôt field an impressive army or that they were less advanced than Rome. I merely wish to illustrate that Parthia wasn‚Äôt really better than Rome when it came to fighting. Battle of Mount Gindarus After Antony‚Äôs failed invasion the Parthians invaded Roman territory. Antony needed to repel them quickly or face a hit to his reputation and a territorial loss. Thus in 38 BC the Parthians and Romans clashed at the battle of Mount Gindarus. The Romans were set up on a small hill giving them the high ground. They allowed the Parthians to cross a nearby river and close in on their position. The Parthian army was mostly cavalry, boasting a strong horse archer core with heavy cavalry and infantry to boot Publius Bassus the Roman general, was patient. He knew he had the high ground and wanted to keep it. The Parthians, believing the Romans to be weak cowards, suddenly charged without orders. The Romans saw this and Publius ordered his infantry to engage the horse archers who were moving uphill. The Infantry closed in quickly and the horse archers paid dearly for this. They were but to pieces and forced to retreat. The horse archers retreated into their own army causing confusion and panic. The Romans then used slingers to rain missile fire on the heavy cavalry. The cavalry began to try and close in on the Roman position and the Infantry attacked. The Parthian general was identified and killed and his heavy cavalry retreated. With the cavalry gone the remainder of the army fled for their lives but most were cut down trying to retreat. Rome suffered few casualties and the Parthians paid dearly for this defeat. You can kinda see here what I am talking about. The Romans were careful to engage on the right terrain and be proactive with the battle. They usually were not ones to sit around and take missle fire without end. If you were on good terrain and made efforts to close in and engage the Parthian cavalry you could reasonably expect to defeat them."},{"instruction":"there an affordable webbased small business accounting software?","output":"Look at Kashflow.

The ball would accelerate towards the Earth due to the gravitational force between the ball and the Earth. Assuming the ball is thrown with a speed that is less than the escape velocity of the Earth (which is approximately 11.2 km/s at the surface), the ball would eventually fall towards the Earth and either land on the surface or burn up in the Earth's atmosphere due to friction with the air. The exact path that the ball would take would depend on factors such as the speed and angle at which it was thrown, as well as the gravitational field of the Earth. It's important to note that throwing objects towards the Earth from space can be dangerous, as any object with sufficient mass and velocity could potentially cause damage or harm if it collided with the Earth or with objects in orbit around it. For this reason, it's generally not recommended to throw objects towards the Earth or any other celestial body in space."},{"instruction":"the greatest design classic the Fender Stratocaster?","output":"Unless you can find a way to measure greatness, this is impossible to answer.

Archive the original image because the JPEG image will never be as good as the source image. Use PNG for sending and displaying composite graphic images or illustrations over the internet. JPEG is a file format developed by photographic experts for the digital storage and display of photographic images. It is a lossy compression format that takes advantage of the limitations of human perception to throw away image data bits that you normally wouldn't miss. When converting an image, the amount of compression can be chosen by the user with greater compression producing smaller files but at a cost of lower resolution, grainier image quality. The JPEG format does NOT support transparency; there are no transparent areas in a photograph. PNG is a file format developed for the transport of graphics over networks, hence the name Portable Network Graphics (PNG). It is a raster-graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG supports transparency, grayscale, and all combinations of RGB images. It does NOT support CMYK based images used in professional printing environments."},{"instruction":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","output":"Dentro de las principales ventajas son las siguientes: Deducci√≥n fiscal: Un porcentaje del pago de las rentas y los gastos del auto son deducibles de impuestos.

My most unforgettable trip was in South Africa. My company sent me there to attend a conference. I was only there for a week. I mostly stayed in Sandton - their financial district. But one of my VPs had a sister who lived there and she invited me to her house while I was there. She had her bodyguard pick me up at the hotel I was staying at. Her place was about ~30 mins drive from the hotel. We drove past dirt roads when we left Sandton. Then we came to some kind of a checkpoint with armed guards and tall metal gates. The driver had to show his ID to be let in. Needless to say, her house (mansion, actually) was very impressive. She told me her brother (my boss) would call her and joke about how hard her life must be when she would give her bodyguard and/or maids a day off and she would have to go shopping all by herself. I told her I was a bit taken aback by having picked up/escorted by a bodyguard. I asked her if it‚Äôs really necessary to have bodyguards in Johannesburg. She told me if I had asked her this a couple decades ago, her answer would have been ‚Äúyes‚Äù. But now it‚Äôs just become part of their normal lifestyle and have gotten used to it. It really is a different kind of lifestyle that was interesting to see from an outsiders point of view. But she wasn‚Äôt arrogant, or off putting or a snob. She was very gracious, classy yet down to earth, and a very stunning lady. The conference also hosted some field trips, and one of them was to a local wildlife sanctuary. We were put in a school bus and as soon as they opened the gates, we saw a couple of giraffes approach our bus and they licked the bus windows as we slowly drove by. Ever seen a giraffe‚Äôs tongue up close? üòÜ I have!!! Plus their super long eyelashes are definitely something to be envied! We also visited a couple of centers that hosts after-school sporting activities for the local youths who are under privileged. They explained how they leverage kid‚Äôs interest in football and teach them about social education. One thing that stood out and I found most endearing in that whole trip - was the way the people find reasons to celebrate, sing, and dance regardless of how hard or challenging their life is.

[LINKED_TEXT: List of United Kingdom general elections - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_general_elections] I am going to be a bit simplistic in my assessment of this, but I think it‚Äôs broadly correct. Clement Atlee led the Labour party to victory in 1945 on a wave of euphoria following the defeat of Germany and after 5 years of war time austerity (I mean real austerity, not the current snowflake variety). It was a time of momentous change and the Labour Party offered a new vision for the UK where the common man looked upon the socialist agenda as a reward for the sacrifices made during the war. The narrow victory for the Conservatives following in 1951, then 1955, were a minor backlash against these policies, although notably, the Conservatives did not reverse them. The 1959 increased majority was boosted by the perception that the Labour Party had not supported action over Suez. Bear in mind that in the period 1951 up until 1964, the Conservative party leaders were essentially pre-war politicians, who were schooled in the politics of the 19th century. They squandered the opportunity to lead the UK into the post war era, preferring to be the party of continuity. The electorate punished the Conservative party for this policy in the elections of 1964 and 1966. Harold Wilson was the youngest prime minister in over a century, quite fitting in a decade of the ‚Äúswinging sixties‚Äù, where youth culture was coming to the fore. Around the time of the 1970 election onward, I can rely more on my own memory of events. By 1970, it had become apparent that, despite its leader‚Äôs youthful promise, Labour was not delivering prosperity and success. The economy was failing and the country as a whole was seeing the reality of what a semi-socialist state looked like. Large chunks of the economy were nationalized, including the railways, all the utilities, coal, steel, airlines, buses, post office and ship building. The Wilson government had intervened in the British car industry, creating the forerunner of British Leyland. None of these were a commercial success, most being created to save jobs and political face, rather than any real attempt to preserve services or improve life for the customers. I am not a fan of unfettered private sector which successive governments to this day have failed to effectively manage. However, the wholesale operation of nationalized industries in the 1960s proved to be an unmitigated disaster. The resulting strain on the economy led to Wilson‚Äôs downfall. Then came Heath. In pictures he looked the part, but when he came to office, reality was that he just didn‚Äôt live up to expectations. I think he rivals May for the title of the Conservative‚Äôs worst leader. He performed quite well when on the hustings, in front of a live audience. I remember being in the audience and seeing him speak. However, he lacked the common touch and most importantly, he was useless in front of a TV camera. Anyone who thinks Corbyn‚Äôs Andrew Neil interview was a PR train wreck should look up Heath‚Äôs party political broadcasts on Youtube. The rest of the 1970s were a slog fest between Labour and the Conservatives, where none really gained the upper hand and most tellingly, the problems with the UK economy were not addressed. The UK experienced its lowest point in the post war era, with the three day week, power cuts and civil unrest. My father was a civil servant at the time and attended ‚Äútripartite‚Äù talks in Downing Street between unions, employers and government. He was usually an upbeat character, but was often severely depressed following those sessions. I won‚Äôt dwell on Thatcher, except to summarize, she was charismatic, had the common touch, addressed the problems that bedeviled the economy and won three general elections with healthy majorities. She undoubtedly restored a measure of Britain‚Äôs prestige in the eyes of the world. Unfortunately, she went too far with some of her policies, particularly the poll tax, and was punished for it. The other side of the Thatcher coin was Michael Foot. To this day I shudder when I recall his rambling speeches and read his far left manfesto, which so mirrored the party conference resolutions. How, when Thatcher was galloping ahead in the polls, could any in the Labour party think that such radically opposing proposals could be vote winners? Sheer madness. Foot also lacked the common touch. The ideological left stuck with him, but most other supporters just felt sorry for him. Major was another bland character. However, the UK had done well economically under Thatcher and Major had corrected a number of the problems Thatcher had caused by overreaching herself in later years. The other factor in that election was not so much what Thatcher had done, but what Labour hadn‚Äôt, in that they were not offering anything much different from the previous socialist agenda, which had proved to be unsuccessful and had been rejected by the electorate. Another thing which will resonate with the 2019 voters was Labour‚Äôs claims that the NHS was failing under the Conservatives. Then as now, the voters didn‚Äôt buy it. Then came Blair. I think his victory was the most interesting of the lot. He was charismatic, unlike Major. He promised prosperity, yet with a ‚Äúcaring‚Äù side. He didn‚Äôt try to scare the voters by saying the Conservatives would destroy the NHS, but instead vowed to build it. He promised to control or lower taxes. He outlined several policies that were seen as tougher on crime. Much of this were rehashed Conservative policies. Major tried to point this out, but did it in such a way as to try to scare the voters. As with other attempts to do this, it failed. Plus Blair made people feel good about Britain again. He didn‚Äôt do this by strong overseas policies (the Gulf War had a negative effect). It was more his youthful embrace of culture. Major on the other hand, was in a difficult situation. He was an uncharismatic leader, his handling of the economy had been shaky and he had no new policies with which to galvanize his base. Gordon Brown? He was a competent chancellor, but a useless prime minister. No charisma, no common touch and no vision for the future. The voters elected Cameron with a somewhat slender majority in 2010. I think they were looking for ‚ÄúBlair 2.0‚Äù, without the Brown baggage. What they got was ‚ÄúHeath 2.0‚Äù and the resulting coalition with Nick Clegg gave us the promise of a Brexit referendum and the Fixed Term Parliament Act. ‚ÄòNuff said! In 2015, Cameron was up against Ed Miliband. I remember wondering, who is this guy? when I saw his picture. I thought they had elected his brother David, who had a track record in government and was a charismatic and presentable guy. Ed, on the other hand, had no charisma, no common touch and espoused policies that vacillated with little clear conviction, which again has similarities to Corbyn‚Äôs 2019 campaign. Then we come to Corbyn. I won‚Äôt mention Boris, because the question is why Labour lost not why he won. Corbyn was up against May in 2016 and frankly, the Labour party should have seen the ENORMOUS writing on the wall then, but didn‚Äôt. As we can see above, in order to win convincingly, you need: Charisma, including being presentable in the media Clear policies that offer a vision forward. Have the common touch Manage the economy in a way that doesn‚Äôt screw it up The electorate like a Britain that is seen as ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù in the world (I don‚Äôt just mean militarily) Be credible in the policies that you put forward (by this I refer to implausible claims about the NHS, clearly unfunded proposals, etc). Corbyn and his recent predecessors don‚Äôt score well with the above. Plus‚Ä¶What was shown clearly in 1951, 1970, 1979, 1997, 2019 (and even a bit in 2017), is that a clearly socialist policy including nationalization, unilateral disarmament and other socialist ideals, has been rejected by the electorate on many occasions. There is nothing today to indicate that this will ever change.

The questions in UPSC tend to focus on the macro views on broad concepts which involves a multi=dimensional approach towards answer.The questions asked in GS these days would not be restricted to only one topic but would involve a mixture of two or three topics.Despite so many coaching institutes in existence, rarely any questions come directly from any material. This outlines the need for answer writing practice as application in the examination hall is of paramount importance.There are certain controversial topics which UPSC avoids such as religion (for instance AYODHYA verdict). You can also ignore all political statements that the ruling party or opposition makes.In order to understand the demand of UPSC, you need to focus on the underlying concept rather than the news. For instance, there was news about Sachin Pilot defection to BJP. So the news is useless but the important aspect is anti-defection related provisions in constitution, their effectiveness and the way forward. Similarly, people dying in corona (facts and figures) not important.You need to focus on things that are in news in a broad way. For instance, owing to vaccine development, Serum Institute in India is in news. We all would have read about it. But UPSC in prelims will not ask on question regarding COVID vaccine development and Serum Institute. Instead, it will give you couple of statements about Serum Institute and ask you identify which of the following is true. So please do not focus on the news too much but the underlying issue or organisation of interest.Another key aspect that I have understood from past paper analysis is that the test series given by any institute is very different that the paper made by UPSC. So take your test series with a pinch of salt. The actual paper would be very different. Hope these help.

I strongly suggest you read the Two Treatises on Government, especially the Second Treatise, by John Locke, and also The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. They are the foundations thinkers of the Enlightenment on whose principles the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution are based, well as as the fundamental values of American justice and civil rights. You will learn that rights are the ability to do something without needing to ask permission, and that your rights end where they impinge in the rights of anyone else, and vice versa. Rights can never involve demanding the time, labor, or services of another person. To do so is to engage in slavery. The purpose of government, explained by Locke, is to protect human rights, and to do so government must be structured to be minimal and to not interfere in the rights of individuals. The purpose of the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution, for example, is not to confer rights, but to expressly forbid government from interfering in the natural rights of American citizens. The Constitution further sets out certain enumerated duties of government, but expressly forbids government from engaging in activities not specifically enumerated. The Social Contract discusses how individual rights work in a community where we interact closely with others. These are essential reading if you want to understand Human rights and government.

Evolution, Anthropology, SCIENCE, Elite-Universities, Uni Professors ... and their Recognition, Knowledge, and Wisdom? The following text I wrote a few days ago to answer one other question could be useful to you. There is no and there can be no spirituality among the so-called humans, while they live in an animal state/ in the animalness. Earthly wisdom and knowledge, wisdom and knowledge of the fleshly (= spiritless) beings, wrongly called human beings, because they live in the bodies, wrongly called human-bodies? Such bodies (falsely called human-bodies) are in fact and truth, primate-bodies/ monkey-bodies, which belong to the primate-family and are almost 100% genetically identical to the bodies of their brothers/ chimpanzees and Co. Therefore, they should not be called man-like-apes, but alleged men should be called monkey-like-men. Primates/ apes do not belong to humans, but the so-called humans (little more precisely: people) belong to the big primate family. It is mainly about good food, good sleeping place and good females (or males) ... In order to position themselves better in this regard and in this world, everything is done: buffaloed/ studied, worked hard, opened companies, entered into the most dishonorable business and political alliances, waged wars of conquest, etc. Besides the good food, sleeping place, and females/ males, in addition, there are some \\"toys\\", so that the primates/ monkey-like-people have an excuse. On the other hand, humans are the rarest species living in such monkey-bodies. Cf. \\"the narrow gate\\" and \\"little flock\\" Mt.7:13-14; Lk. 13:24 and 12:32. (The same was revealed in all the other true God's Scriptures.) Most of those who live in such monkey-bodies are animals (many tame, some wild beasts), demons, satans/ devils, not many angels, and only some humans. Only humans can awake and be saved. Because of them, our Lord created the heavens and the earth. And the primates/ apes are supposed to can be wise and knowledgeable? Only those whom God lets shake off and overcome that state can attain some recognition and some wisdom. Your most famous philosophers, for example, should belong to the wise ones (according to your criteria). Some of them recommend hedonism, others asceticism, and some - something in between. It can be noon, it can be midnight ... None of that has anything to do with recognition, knowledge, and wisdom. Nevertheless, it does not hurt in the younger years to deal also with the earthly philosophies. But all of them, without exception, at the end of their (in vain lived) lives - if they are honest - can admit: \\"I know that I know nothing\\". That is the true value and truth content of all earthly philosophies regarding recognition, knowledge, and wisdom. But honesty is a character trait that adorns very few inhabitants of the earth. Most (of course, not only philosophers) want to present themselves as knowledgeable and wise. What does \\"lived in vain\\" mean? Every life is lived in vain in which you do not develop spiritually. (Almost) everyone strives to reproduce (to have children), to earn money and acquire desired material things, to live as long as possible contentedly and happily, and so on. Everything mentioned is only counterproductive and represents a burden that binds one to the earth, transience, and death. It is like a donkey carrying gold on its back, the more of it - the heavier/ harder. The longer one lives under these circumstances, the more guilt one loads on oneself. Spiritual development is the only thing you take with you (when you leave this world), which has become a part of your being and can be developed further. Everything else was in vain or even harmful. Not one existential question can be answered by the philosophers and the like, by all earthly thinking people/ primates. Such recognitions/ knowledge and wisdom can come only from One who knows everything and who is Wise - as a gift for the observance of His Supreme Commandments. To the lowest primate kind belong all your religion-leaders, without exception, in all earthly religions. That's why they can't gain a single recognition of what is really written in God's Scriptures. They only preach stupidities and their dogmas, their \\"truths\\", which exceed the ignorance of the philosophers by light-years. In their godlessness, they only want to exploit you - to gain more influence, honor, and money. Many also abuse you in the other, even more reprehensible ways. In such a state are the so-called men, i.e. apes, who believe that they know something or that they know a lot - thanks to some eprouvettes, microscopes, telescopes, and a few more instruments and devices - that God made them discover. Lastly, God has made you discover (to wake some humans up) that matter is not matter/ that matter does not consist of matter. You can see something about this on YouTube. So great is the blindness, the illusion of the inhabitants of the earth. There has hardly been an epoch in the history in which the so-called men have known so little. ____ All mentioned beings, who live in the primate bodies, should serve and help all other beings, because this possibility and ability are given to most of them. The few (true) humans should also do that as long as they are in \\"sleep/ animalness\\". But when they are awakened and return to their true nature (= human), they left all this to God and have the duties only to God and the few (true) humans. They are not allowed to take care of anything else, because it is not allowed to them anymore, because they have received the recognition that there is only One, who takes care of all, who feeds all, keeps alive (as long as He wants) and provides all manifold (as He wants)."},{"instruction":"What type of government is in Starship Troopers?","output":"It‚Äôs a representative democracy with a slightly unusual franchise restriction."},{"instruction":"Are Hong Kong activists still protesting in 2021?","output":"No. Under the New National Security Laws, the police can arrest you on whatever trump up charges, put you in jail without bail and wait for your case to be heard which could be months, sometimes up to two years.

As a [LINKED_TEXT: business analyst] [URL: https://www.arsccomlearning.in/business-analysts-certification-course/?sid=1], I can tell you that the role is both exciting and challenging. The main responsibility of a business analyst is to bridge the gap between IT and business by understanding the needs and requirements of the business and then communicating that to the IT team. A business analyst must have a deep understanding of both the business and the technology, so they can accurately articulate the requirements of the business and ensure that the IT solutions meet those requirements. In my experience, one of the biggest challenges faced by business analysts is to gather requirements from various stakeholders who may have different perspectives and priorities. It is important for a business analyst to have excellent communication and interpersonal skills to effectively gather and consolidate these requirements. Additionally, they must also have a strong analytical mindset to be able to identify patterns, trends, and connections that may not be immediately apparent to others. This helps in finding the root cause of a problem and coming up with effective solutions. I remember a time when I was working on a project for a financial institution. The stakeholders had conflicting requirements, and it was my responsibility to find a way to balance the needs of all parties involved. I took the time to understand the needs and goals of each stakeholder, and then used my analytical skills to find a solution that met everyone's requirements. It was a challenging project, but I was able to successfully deliver a solution that everyone was happy with.

It does sound like a Chinese CCP propaganda piece to show the seeds of dissension. But so be it. Aussies keep it real. The cultures are pretty integrated historically. There are a lot of kiwis living in Australia. So let me note some observations: Kiwi men are fond of cheating. They aren't lone sheep about it. More like pack animals affirming each other.Kiwi women are pretty rough as well. They have weaponized sex and alcohol. My first GF, a Kiwi, when I was 10yo at school in Australia was quite the tease. Seeing her accidentally 50 years later, she had teeth missing.Kiwis are particularly sexually active. You could be at open house waiting for the inspection and there will be two kiwis having sex in the car in front.A kiwi who lived in London told me a long time ago that ‚Äòkiwis struggle with criticism'.I've never seen so many religious cults than in NZ. Destiny Church is the most famous one. I think it enjoys more profile because of the money it attracts. I could be led to believe this is a ‚Äòrural thing', and that the cities are different. Well, Christchurch and Wellington aren't. Plenty of whore houses and porn stores. Maybe Auckland represents higher standards. So let me contend with the kiwi views of Australians. I think kiwis don't have any gripes except for: Judgement about them. Kind to you as long as you are kind to them. Like reflecting mirrors. Shallow?Constant jokes about them. A plumber I knew complained about the constant jokes against kiwis on the goldfields of WA. He got sick of it, and lost his job. It is a small country.

(Pictures in comments)","output":"Not really, I‚Äôm afraid. Microwaves are, firstly, high powered devices, putting out around 700W‚Äîthat‚Äôs a horsepower. A horse is plenty strong enough to break a plate. Now, microwaves are electromagnetic waves, essentially a form of light energy. They have a ‚Äúcolour‚Äù that happens to be absorbed readily by liquid water, which is why they are effective: our food mostly has some water in it, but our crockery doesn‚Äôt (or shouldn‚Äôt), so you don‚Äôt waste so much power heating containers! However, these electromagnetic waves can also create extremely powerful electrical fields in metals, and this leads to the well-known fireworks you get when you put a fork in one. A correctly-functioning microwave should just heat water and not much else. It‚Äôs worth mentioning here, though, that the device producing the microwaves‚Äîusually a magnetron‚Äîruns at about 1500 volts. There are all kinds of reasons why a microwave might catch fire, but the simplest one is this: it‚Äôs full of high voltage electricity! Insulation breaks down or wears over time, the power eventually arcs through the insulating material, and voil√†: microwave fire. (I‚Äôve seen this happen, and it‚Äôs pretty spectacular.) As for plate breaking: without knowing specifics I couldn‚Äôt attest to this, but I had some pretty cheap plates that got awfully hot when I would microwave them, and over the years they developed cracks. Water getting into a crack would tend to boil in a microwave. I can readily understand how a microwave could break a plate, as well.

Learn Common Phrases of the Local Language A simple ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù in the local language goes a long way. I also like to learn the word for beer, but that‚Äôs just me. #4. Don‚Äôt Forget an Extra Camera Battery (or Two) Have you ever gotten to that epic sunset photo spot and realized your camera battery is dead and you don‚Äôt have a back up? I try to bring at least three camera batteries on all of our trips so that we don‚Äôt miss out on that perfect shot. #5. Always Bring a Sarong Sarongs can be used as a wrap when you are cold, a towel, a curtain, or a piece of clothing that can be worn dozens of different ways. Solid colors are great, but if you want something that stands out, I love this sarong. #6. Always Buy Travel Insurance A medical emergency can wipe out your savings ‚Äî or even worse. We use and trust World Nomads for travel insurance. #7. Make Photocopies of Important Documents In my early twenties, I was very good about keeping a copy of my passport in a separate bag from my actual passport. Then I got lazy. Recently, a friend of mine lost her passport at the airport. She was told that if she had brought a copy of it and extra passport photos they would have let her travel. Since she didn‚Äôt, she was forced to forfeit a 2,000 flight and a week in Europe. I now carry a copy with me. #8. Pre-plan Your Outfits I‚Äôm a lazy, last-minute packer, so I‚Äôve spent too many trips with all black or all grey outfits because I didn‚Äôt plan my outfits before packing. I look back at photos and wish I had put more effort into packing. #9. Put Electronics, Medications, Toothbrush, and an Extra Pair of Underwear in Your Carry-on A few important items should always go in your carry-on. A swimsuit is also a good idea if you are going on a beach vacation. You can buy most of these things if your bag gets lost, but having them in your carry-on will save you money and time if your luggage gets lost in transit. #10. Enquire about the price BEFORE You Take Public Transportation It‚Äôs a good idea to ask about the price before you hop on a bus, guagua, or other form of public transportation. We learned our lesson in the Dominican Republic. #11. Bring Lotion in Your Carry-on I fill both sides of a contact lens case with hydrating lotion (I use this all-natural hydrating lotion) because they rarely have it in the lavatories and airplane cabins are exceptionally dry. #12. Stay Hydrated on Planes I know it‚Äôs fun to get drunk at 30,000 feet, but it‚Äôs also much easier to get dehydrated. Staying hydrated ‚Äî especially on long-haul flights ‚Äî makes it easier to get over jet lag too. #13. Put Your Room Number & Hotel Address in Your Phone Am I the only one who can‚Äôt remember my hotel room number?? There has to be others out there like me. #14. Ask The Locals We always ask the locals to point us to the best restaurants, awesome spots to watch the sunset, the best coffee shops, etc. I do like to tell people what type of food I‚Äôm craving though. I‚Äôve been led to some interesting restaurants that wouldn‚Äôt have been my first choice. #15. Beware of Free Public WIFI I always try to avoid logging into bank accounts or entering any passwords while I‚Äôm using free public WIFI at a place like an airport. I‚Äôm not as strict about it once I‚Äôve gotten to my hotel, especially if they have a password for their wifi. #16. Alert Your Bank and Credit Card Company of Your Travel Plans This is a great habit to get into if you don‚Äôt want your credit card company or bank to put a hold on your card while you are overseas. #17. Book Early for Cheap Flights Flights are always the first thing I book when planning a trip ‚Äî sometimes I do this nearly a year in advance! For the most part, the earlier you book, the better price you will get. Airfare rarely goes down in price unless there is a sale (or an airline pricing error). #18. Leave Room for Spontaneity Don‚Äôt plan your entire itinerary ahead of time. It‚Äôs tempting, I know, but those unplanned moments while traveling can be the best memories. #19. Let Someone at Home Know Your Plans This is extremely important when traveling solo, but it‚Äôs still a good idea no matter how many people are in your travel group. 20. Separate Your Personal Items When Scott and I travel together, we mix our personal items into each checked bag (assuming we have more than one). That way if one of our bags gets lost, we both still have some clothing and personal items. #21. Separate Your Sources of Money Don‚Äôt keep all of your cash and cards in one spot. I usually hide some cash and a back up credit/bank card in a separate bag ‚Äî not the same bag as my wallet."},{"instruction":"Waters or Gilmour, who fares better as a solo artist?","output":"If you like Pink Floyd primarily for the sound effects, for the lyrics, and for the way individual songs were part of a greater theme, you will prefer Roger Waters.

However the world can not build multi terawatt scale dams because too much ecosystem damage would result. These are about 90% efficient. Wind energy is about 50% efficient and is a multi terawatt scale option. [LINKED_TEXT: Center for Sustainable Systems] [URL: http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/wind-energy-factsheet] Solar energy is about 20% efficient and should cause the least enviro disturbance since the sun's energy is merely being transferred from the site to society. However, 50 TW of solar (needed to power futureworld, make itself and batteries) will require about 1/4th of 1% of the Earth's total land and ocean area. If placed on land, the darker color of the panels might cause extra heating despite some of the energy being transferred away. This is because they are not efficient enough to counter their heating as compared to what the surface would heat to. For example, a solar farm might be only 10% reflective while the desert might be 50% reflective. Subtract the 20% efficiency of the panel and you still have an extra 20% of heating. This is why we should somehow place terawatt scale solar on the open ocean. The ocean also absorbs as much light as the panels. This would actually have a cooling effect on the ocean, especially if solar gets more efficient in the future. This would help to counteract the extra heat forcing caused by burning fossil fuels. Therefore, even though solar is the least efficient, it can become the one source with the greatest potential and with the least amount of enviro degradation. I do not believe terawatt scale wind could cause enviro damage either, except for killing creatures that fly. Nuclear can be viewed as renewable if fissioned in what's called the closed cycle. Molten salts make it safe and this design allows for the complete ‚Äúburn up‚Äù of the heavy metal. In this way we do not create the very long lived wastes which is created when heavy metal absorbs rather than being split by a neutron. The fission products (those that are split) decay back down to safe (normal) background levels in a matter of days to about 350 years. Although highly rad, this is containable on the human rather than geological timescales. It is about 40% efficient. Since the closed cycle requires about 1/200th the fuel as today's nuclear, the rate at which heavy metal (thorium and uranium) gets deposited into the ocean is greater than the multi terawatt amounts we would use. Together, all these energy sources will power humanity with vastly more energy than the total fossil fuel store. Therefore, we must use our fossil fuels wisely by using it for building this better and clean energy infrastructure!"},{"instruction":"f you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?","output":"It would make more sense to tax the rich who‚Äôve enjoyed 40 years of tax cuts while the nation‚Äôs infrastructure rotted and our society declined.

[LINKED_TEXT: Clackamas Town Center shooting - WikipediaMass shooting near Portland, Oregon On December 11, 2012, a shooting occurred at the Clackamas Town Center in the relatively urban section of Clackamas County , just outside the city of Portland, Oregon , United States. The gunman, 22-year-old Jacob Tyler Roberts, ran into the shopping center wearing black clothing and a white expressionless facial mask and sporadically opened fire using a Stag Arms AR-15 rifle stolen from a friend. He fired a total of 17 shots, killing two people and seriously wounding a third. Many shots were ricochets. Having attempted to reload his weapon and dropping three magazines, Roberts entered an employee-only back stairwell that runs behind all stores in the mall and committed suicide after descending one level. He had no connection to any of his victims, and it was believed to be a random act of violence. [3] Details [ edit ] Prior to the shooting [ edit ] Sometime prior to the shooting, Roberts is stated to have stolen a Stag Arms STAG-15 AR-15-style rifle from an acquaintance. Immediately before the shooting, he visited a friend who lived two miles away from the Clackamas Town Center, smoked marijuana with him, and claimed that he was moving to Hawaii . [1] He drove to the mall sometime later and parked at the south side between Macy's and Chipotle Mexican Grill . He ran into the mall through Macy's department store at 3:28 p.m., [1] wearing a white expressionless facial mask and dressed in a black sweater and black pants. He was armed with the AR-15. He was also carrying five loaded magazines, one of which he accidentally dropped in the parking lot while entering the mall. [1] Roberts legally bought four additional 30-round ammunition magazines and the ammunition to fill them at three local stores, including a Walmart , The Gunbroker, and Wholesale Sports Outdoor Outfitters. When he stole the unsecured AR-15 from a friend, it was loaded with a 30-round ammunition magazine. Between 8,000 and 10,000 people were inside the mall at the time. People who first saw him run into the mall believed the tactical clothing and hockey mask were a paintball outfit and that the rifle was a toy. [4] Shooting [ edit ] Standing in a large atrium, Roberts first opened fire at the mall's food court that was across from him at his left. The first person shot was 54-year-old shopper Cindy Ann Yuille, a hospice nurse and mother of two who was shot in the back; she died despite efforts of bystanders to treat her wound. [1] Fifteen-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, who was walking through the mall with her friend to reach the Town Center MAX station, was the second person to be shot; she received a bullet to the chest, but she survived and made it out of the mall, where she was treated for her gunshot wound. [4] The final victim was 45-year-old youth sports coach Steven Forsyth, the father of future NFL player Alex Forsyth , who was sitting by a rented kiosk and talking to his father on his cell phone when he was shot in the head and killed.

Being cold-blooded they wouldn‚Äôt be able to maintain body temperature and being huge, they would be too heavy. That said: there is one theory that covers this biological problem. The theory is known as ‚Äúgenesis‚Äù. According to genesis the Earth had a huge layer of water in the upper atmosphere. This would cause three important factors for dinosaurs: The weight of the water would increase the air pressure and cause buoyancy. Things would seem lighter. Animals would be able to be larger (animals aka dinosaurs).The water layer would produce a world-wide greenhouse effect. This would stabilize temperatures allowing for such things as huge cold-blooded animals to roam the Earth.Particularly for the pterodactyl: The thick air would make it easier to fly. Allowing for larger or less muscular flyers. Dinosaurs can not exist today. This is evident since their descendants have survived but we do not see anything that can be called a dinosaur (huge lizard).

In fact, I recall it as my happiest year out of the past 5. I was in good shape, had just gotten out of a major depression and was overcoming abuse. I was finally coming out of a negative spiral and I was discovering new things - mostly important K-Pop and Korean culture. It may sound so silly to you, but it did wonders to me. I started writing fanfiction and fell in love with writing all over again. Placed finalist in a national writing contest. Met my one and only Tabi [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #XLqcB] that year too (believe me, this guy has given me so much strenght). I found myself that year. 2012 (15 years old) Only to lose myself this year. It‚Äôs the black year. The year I want to forget. I went back to my depressive cycle after my grandfather‚Äôs passing. Became overweight. Spent so much time in the hospital. Emotionally and physically, I was a mess. I was devastated. Felt worthless. Depressed. Erratic. Suicidal. I felt like no one could or would ever love me. That I didn‚Äôt deserve to be loved. 2013 (16 years old) See that smile? That‚Äôs a genuine smile. It took me so long. Months. To feel like I should laugh with other people. Feel like I should enjoy life with them. My brother‚Äôs birth turned my life around. I knew he needed me. He needed me so, so much. If I had to push out for someone, I had to do it for him. Cristiano did for me what no one else had: Give me that innocent joy back. Timeless, adorable Cristiano for you. My finalists trip to Italy was refreshing. It made me realise so many things. I had also lost 20kg. I let people take pictures of me, because I was proud of my body. I loved how I looked like. I was confident enough to pose in the middle of a group of people. I liked getting attention because I finally felt like I deserve it. My life took a turn for the best this year. Definitely. 2014 (17 years old) This year was all smiles. Until October. I started going from ER to ER. From hospital to hospital. This extended to early 2015. Out of 9 months of schooling, I missed 4. 4 months spent in hospitals and at home, resting. 2015 (18 years old) ^^^^^^^This is me. After I got my health problems solved, I somehow managed to enter college (and the degree that I was dreaming of) the month after I turned 18. All of a sudden, I was living on my own, with people I didn‚Äôt know. 2 hours (by car) and 4 hours (by train) away from my parents. All was new and exciting. I started so many new, great friendships.

Would you still have to have a priest?","output":"In most Western cultures, marriage is a civil contract between two consenting adults. No clergy is required, nor is a house of worship the required location. Also, no livestock changes ownership. The state defines who is legally entitled to perform the marriage, and it may be as simple as go to city hall, get a license, see the properly authorized official with the license, identification & provide or pay for two witnesses. No church, no religious ceremony, and (again) no livestock changing ownership. Also, no virginity test for the bride, and, so long as age restrictions (set by the government) are met, no parental authorization needed. I have attended a wedding at a sci-if convention where the officiant was a day player who appeared in 12 Star Trek episodes. The bride and groom were dressed as Klingons, the ceremony was conducted in Klingon (with a translation to English on a TV), the officiant was dressed as a Starfleet Admiral, the best man was a Ferengi and the maid of honour was a Trill.

When you have finished your main course, the waiter will come back to take your order for the cheese course, then dessert and finally coffee in that sequence.If you want a medium steak, you must ask for it ¬´ Bien cuit ¬ª otherwise it will arrive dripping in blood. Be warned!Don't order the steak carpaccio unless you've got good teeth. These are thin slices of raw beef which are as tough as shoe-leather.If you see cuisses de grenouilles (frogs' legs) on the menu, don't order them. The French don't eat them in spite of what you've been told, so they will have been in the bottom of the freezer for three years and will have probably thawed out and re-frozen several times and will have completely lost their flavour and texture.A French waiter asks what you would like to drink, but doesn't ask you if you'd like another drink when the main course arrives. So as soon as the starters arrive, make sure that you order more drinks before they disappear into the kitchen for an hour.In France, you are expected to keep your cutlery for the second course.French waiters don't understand that putting your knife and fork together on the plate in the half-past-six position means that you want it cleared. The French don't know that, so they will ask ¬´ Termin√© ? ¬ª irrespective of the position of your knife and fork although it would be obvious to anyone else.Don't forget to leave a good tip even if the menu says ¬´ Service compris ¬ª. ‚Ç¨2 per person on your table would be the absolute minimum."},{"instruction":"Which angel is more popular, the Angel Michael, or the Angel Gabriel?","output":"no reason to even think about that!"},{"instruction":"Why can‚Äôt I tell a narcissist how I really feel about how they treated me?","output":"For someone to listen to you and understand, they would have to care (have some level of empathy).

Only when Steppenwolf comes to the Earth and then Darkseid is revealed, do you see that he then had the Omega Effect. When Cyborg was connected to the AI of the Kryptonian Scout Ship and he's having flashes of the future, you see how Darkseid kills Aquaman and you see him use his Omega Beams on the Atlanteans. The same Omega Beams that were disintegrating anyone they touched.

Are farmers happy?","output":"Farmers often live in rural areas and can be isolated; for many, although they may have wealth tied up in stock or crops or land, it isn‚Äôt necessarily a lucrative business. Often farmers have large mortgages and low incomes. The weather has always been a major variable outside the farmer‚Äôs control, but now climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent & more intense. Many famers have to deal with such inclement weather that it detrimentally affects their psyche and their conditions of work and their livestock or crop production. If production suffers as a result, then the farmer is unable to make enough sales to adequately provide for himself and his family. This increases overall financial stress, and leaves the farmer with less money to reinvest in the business - with less money to reinvest, systems become more strained, shortcuts get taken and the potential crop for the following year may remain lower than average. Not only is being a famer considered to be among the lowest paying jobs in the United States, but it requires long hours and significant hard work. Outside of other family members, being a farmer often results in minimal social interaction, which may contribute to stress and depression. Perhaps most notably, farmers are often exposed to pesticides, which have been linked to suicide. For these reasons, suicide rates among farmers are approximately 1.32 times that of your average occupation."},{"instruction":"w big does a sample size need to be in a survey where the population is 200 million people?","output":"You have some very good answers to this question when you first asked it on Tuesday. But you now are asking me. Let‚Äôs try and keep it simple, yet practical. There are two main types of question about sample size. (1) Suppose you want to find how many (=n) people you would need to sample from the large population to find the proportion who would vote for universal health care. Lets say the last survey found 60% said ‚Äòyes‚Äô, and you want to be 95% certain that your SAMPLE result is within 5% (plus or minus) of what the larger population would vote IF you could ask them. You can find n using [math] n = [1.96/e]^2 P(1-P)[/math] where e is the tolerated error (+/- 5%, or 0.05), P= previous proportion (80% or 0.80), and (1-P) is of course 20% or 0.20 We wanted to be 95% certain, so we use the appropriate correction factor of 1.96 from the t-table; (some people use 2.0) So we have n = {1.96/0.05]^2 x (0.80)(0.20) = (1536.6)(0.16) = 246 rounded to whole numbers of people. If you RANDOMLY sample 246 from your population (any large size), you will be able to state with 95% certainly that your estimation is not more than 5% from the TARGET population result. However, what if your proportion is now found to be 75%? In that case you can go back and adjust what your new tolerated error (e) would be. For instance‚Ä¶.. e = SqRoot [(1.96^2)(P)(1-P) / n ] e = SqRoot [(1.96^2)(0.25)(0.75) / 246 ] = 0.054, or 5.4% (Not far from the original 5%) So we can now conclude that with 246 sample, 75 percent would vote for universal health care, and that this result was accurate to within +/- 5.4%, 19 times out of 20. What does that mean? You now are 95% confident that the POPULATION proportion who would vote this way was within 69.6% and 80.4%! (2) The other need to calculate sample size is for the power analysis. This has been shown by some of the other answers, and if you need an excellent nomogram designed by Douglas Altman, let me know, and I‚Äôll send it to you. Power analysis answers the question‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHow many do I need to include in my study group in order to FIND the effect I am looking for If it exists, and with a known probability?‚Äù"},{"instruction":"What are some plastic surgery masterpieces?","output":"Lot of people suffer from self image issues but in order to change one's appearance a simple haircut can go a long way but here are some people who went under the knife and literally changed the way how they look and the result can sometimes leave a lot to be desired, here have a look. Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. Reconstructive surgery includes craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery aims at improving the appearance of it.

Microwave ovens are safe and convenient appliances that use microwaves, a form of electromagnetic radiation, to cook food. Microwaving food can actually be a healthier cooking method than other methods, such as frying or deep-frying, as it requires little to no added fats or oils. Additionally, microwaving can help to retain the nutrients in foods, as it cooks them quickly and with minimal exposure to heat. However, it's important to follow proper microwave cooking techniques to ensure that food is cooked thoroughly and evenly. This includes stirring food frequently, covering it with a lid or plastic wrap to prevent splattering, and letting it rest for a few minutes after cooking to allow the heat to distribute evenly. It's also important to note that microwaving food in plastic containers can release harmful chemicals into the food, so it's best to use microwave-safe glass or ceramic containers instead.

If Turkey is more interested in fooling around in such serious matters, it cannot be a reliable NATO partner.","output":"The decision of whether or not to expel Turkey from NATO is a complex one that would involve a number of factors and considerations. Turkey has been a member of NATO since 1952, and is considered an important member due to its strategic location, military capabilities, and contributions to NATO operations. In such a case, NATO members would likely discuss the issue and consider possible actions, including diplomatic efforts to address Turkey's concerns and possibly suspending or expelling Turkey from the alliance. It is worth noting that such a decision would not be taken lightly, as the expulsion of a member country would have significant implications for the alliance's security and stability. It's also worth noting that any decision regarding the membership of another country in NATO is ultimately the decision of all the member countries and not just one."},{"instruction":"What is an example of motion in a plane where the magnitude of the displacement need not be equal to the path length?","output":"motion along a circular arc or any other curved line"},{"instruction":"w do I make group calls in WhatsApp?","output":"Sorry but the feature is not yet enabled."},{"instruction":"Why don‚Äôt carbon monoxide detectors alert to natural gas leaks, when gas leaks can cause carbon monoxide poisoning?","output":"Natural gas leaks DO NOT cause Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.

Here‚Äôs the advice I‚Äôd give to a 17-year-old: Find your identity in Christ I am Christian and by far the number 1 advice I‚Äôd like to give you is to find your identity and worth in Christ. That mean, your sins and mistakes don‚Äôt define you but the price Christ paid for me on the cross does. This will help you to know that no matter what you are worth it because God saved and loves you and took you from worthless to worthy. It will also help you to strive to be better every day because that‚Äôs who God says you are. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others This is something that I have heard a lot of successful people and some of my role models say a lot. When you are working on something or yourself, grow but stay in your lane. Succeed and fail and learn and do better with the lessons you have learned from those failures but do not compare your journey or your progress with others. Imagine that you are running, instead of looking how others are doing, focus on your lane and getting to where you want to get because if you keep looking at others, you‚Äôll fall and maybe never get up again so please stay in your lane and focus on your unique journey. Take it slow Like most people, I‚Äôm sure you have goals and dreams‚Ä¶ One advice that I have received from people like Vanessa Lau and Suzy Whirtford is, take is slow and remind yourself that you‚Äôre in it for the long game, that you will be working on your goals for a long time and you should build a strong foundation and when you make a mistake, don‚Äôt wallow in failure, get up and do it again because you are in it for the long game so takes it slow and do it one step at a time. That‚Äôs something I would like to tell you too today love. You don‚Äôt need to know everything or have everything figured out One thing that will put a lot of stress and pressure on you is trying to go through life with everything figured out. I have done this in the past and I can‚Äôt tell you how much of a burden it was. Right now, I just take it one day and a time and I work and make do with what I have and know, I choose to trust God for the future and what I can‚Äôt control. If there‚Äôs something that I don‚Äôt know I learn it and use it but one thing I won‚Äôt do is try to have everything figured out. I am inviting you to do the same, take that load off your shoulders and take it one step at a time. Trust God and live. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up when you make a mistake but learn from them and do better Another thing I have learn and would to share with you is, don‚Äôt beat yourself up when you make a mistake. When you do make a mistake, try to look at what you have learned and write it down. Next time when similar situation arrives, remember the lesson and do better. But one thing you should not do is beat yourself up without getting up and fighting again. Everyone makes mistakes, it‚Äôs how we grow. We learn more from hard times and mistakes than from good things and rewards. So, learn from it and do better. You got this! The only way to achieve anything is if you act This is something I have learned as I have been working on my goals, if you are doing the same or if you keep thinking about doing it but haven‚Äôt yet, here‚Äôs what I have to tell you‚Ä¶ nothing is going to change if you don‚Äôt act. For the changes you want to happen to actually happen, you have to act and work, even if you start with small steps or do it little by little every day, do it, it‚Äôs better than nothing and when you feel like you can do more, by all means, do more. Here‚Äôs a tweet I shared on my Twitter account on this same issue‚Ä¶ Be patient As I have been working on my own goals and going through life in general, I have learned to be patient and it one of the advices I have noticed successful people give a lot. Getting impatient and taking short cuts will backfire eventually, instead go slow, take one step at a time and be patient. Enjoy the present moment while you are waiting and hoping for a better future. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being alone sometimes or having a small social circle Another thing I learned is that, in contrast to what other will tell you, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being alone sometimes or having a small number of friends. I actually think it is better for you to learn to be alone sometimes and not depend or be with people all the time. Don‚Äôt misunderstand me, I am not suggesting you close yourself from all social contact, but learn to be happy just being alone and enjoying the silence and alone time. Do have relationships and social contact with others because we‚Äôre human and are social beings but I am only saying, having a small number of good friends is not wrong or abnormal as today‚Äôs society brands it to be. Life is boring and mundane, learn to enjoy it by finding the little beautiful moments in it. I recently learned this from a YouTuber called‚Ä¶ and I thought about it and it made sense and I use it in my life and I‚Äôll share it with you now. As you will be going through life, you might see other teens or young people way more successful than you and maybe even the adults in your life, you‚Äôll see them go on expensive trips and as they show on social media, live exciting lives. When this happens, don‚Äôt compare your life with theirs and think that your life is worthless, instead know that life is in fact repetitive, boring and mundane. I am not trying to say that in a negative way or anything but I am trying to tell you that while those people have access to that type of lifestyle, most of the people in the world don‚Äôt and they just live their own simple life and do what they have to do every day and what they can do and want to do and THAT IS OKAY, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. What you should do is practice gratitude and learn to love and enjoy your little simple life, cherish it. Do the things that excite you in your own little simple life and forget about other people‚Äôs lives, just focus on your unique life. I am telling you, God put you into this world for a reason and whether you have it all or not, you were created for a reason and to make a meaningful impact in this life. So, trust that and just live your life to the best you can being present and intentional in all you do and everything that happens to you. Enjoy your unique simple life, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm doing right now and I love it so much. That‚Äôs the advice I would give to a 16-year-old, I hope it helps you somehow as it have helped me.

Pure voltage alone, far from any charges ‚Ä¶that‚Äôs known as an electrostatic field or e-field. So, with EM waves, or even with AC changing e-fields, the value of charges can be zero, yet we can still have a large potential difference. Or how about a far less weird reason: two cables which have the same charge-difference can have VASTLY different potential-difference, since potential difference is not charge difference. It depends on the capacitance of the two cables. Also, two capacitors can each have the same charge-difference on their plates, yet have potential difference that‚Äôs off by 100 times, or maybe by 10,000 times, or sometimes a billion times higher than that (compare a 0.1pf capacitor to a 1000farad supercapacitor, each with the same plate-charge. Their voltage differs by 10^16X, a thousand-billion volts ‚Ä¶times ten thousand! But the charge-difference on each capacitor is exactly the same.) See, volts are not coulombs.

However, with the rookie Rosen starting, Johnson finally broke 40 points in game 4. Fingers crossed that is the start of something for him AND Arizona. Brieda, SF, had one monster game with 49 points and the other 3 games equaling the same output. With Garoppolo out, SF is not going to get much better and Brieda is likely going to go in the same direction. I, personally, have Ingram on my team and am definitely starting him this week 5.

When you want to really achieve something, you have to work hard. And working hard involves some discipline and sacrifice. If someone does not want to wake up, that is also fine. People have different goals, and not everyone wants to do everything in life. But when you are ambitious, and want to really succeed in life, you automatically tend to wake up on time and get to work with full energy. Each day is a new day, and each day is important.

Circumstances are not favorable to undertake such a task in this generation. But if you wish to do so, you can opt forests which are in and around Thiruvannamalai. It is located at the foot of Arunachal Hill. It is a place where many siddhars, sadhus live. There are many stories of miracles performed by Siddars at this place. Pic : Thiruvannamalai temple If you want to undertake this journey to attain moksha, I think it's not necessary because Lord Krishna says : Per Srimad Bhagavatham - kaler dosha-nidhe rajann asti hy eko maha gunah kirtanad eva krishnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet ‚ÄúAlthough Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply by chanting the names of Krishna, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.‚Äù It is not in reciting Sri Krishna‚Äôs name over and over without really feeling it that one would attain Moksha, but he meant ‚Äì When an individual truly realises his own self, when there is no place for Ego and no narrow limited, thoughts, it is only then a human truly becomes one with Krishna. One who is one with Sri Krishna is one with the source and hence Enlightened. In kaliyuga, chanting the name of God with true devotion can liberate us from sins and helps us to attain moksha.

It all came together for Yoda when he was watching over Padme as she was giving birth to Luke and Leia. Yoda always sensed there was something troubling Anakin, that no other Jedi including Obi Wan could sense. It all made sense to him in the end. Palpatine manipulated young Skywalker‚Äôs feelings and forced him down the path of the Dark Side in order to save the one he truly loves. Also not just Yoda knew this, but Windu has reason to believe this as well too. As Anakin stepped in to try and stop Windu from killing Palpatine, Windus thoughts and distrust of Anakins confusion and arrogance all game together. Windu figured out that Palpatine manipulated the boy and twisted his mind into thinking the Jedi were evil, and that Sidious can ‚Äúsave the ones he loves‚Äù. And Mace could sense that in that moment, Anakin was being consumed by Darth Vader. And Windu didn‚Äôt want for that to happen to him, because he did not want to kill the boy. Due to Mace Windus shatter point technique, he needs to remain 100% focused on Palpatine to kill him and if he were to stop and talk to Anakin, Palpatine would have killed him. At this point he senses this as they repel lightning from each other and Mace Windu desperately cries out: For that‚Äôs all Mace Windu can say. Because if he were to say more he would lose his shatterpoint focus on Palpatine. Lots of people think Mace Windu hates Anakin and that couldn‚Äôt be further from the case here. He cared about the boy. Why would Windu cry out to Anakin ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt listen to him‚Äù if not to try and save him from the path he was going down.

I smoked for 20+ years and smelled like an ashtray, had no motivation, was tired all of the time and I couldn‚Äôt breath. I tried quitting so many times and I tried everything. The patch, cold turkey, Wellbutrin, the gum, the fake cigs etc. I didn‚Äôt try Chantax but I watched a friend of mine lose her mind on that stuff so I was too afraid to try it. One day I saw someone with an ecig and I asked a million questions about it. Is it bad for you, (like cigs weren‚Äôt) does it really work, what milligram of nicotine should I start with, where do I get one, etc. I tried it and it didn‚Äôt work but this was back in 2009‚Äì2010. I tried it a few more times but it still didn‚Äôt work. I was using those ecigs that looked like reg cigs that came with the prefilled cartridges and those things back then, sucked. Then a friend introduced me to an ecig that had a tank on it. One of those little pen Vapes where you put your own e-liquid in them. I tried that and immediately went out and bought one. I set my quit date and was ready to go. It was New Years Day like every other year where I tried to quit and that usually only lasted anywhere from 4 to 24 hours. Well, on New Years Eve, I went to the store and bought my last pack of smokes and about 30 min later, I was being rushed to the hospital for an emergency surgery. When they told me they were going to admit me, I panicked. I hadn‚Äôt even smoked a cig out of that pack. And since I couldn‚Äôt smoke in the hospital, I tried to ‚Äúgo out to my car for something‚Äù and they reminded me that this was an emergency. So I sent my friend to my house to grab my ecig starter kit and (I don‚Äôt condone this, it‚Äôs just what happened) I vaped in the hospital.

Here are some mistakes to avoid: Lack of clarity: Failing to clearly communicate the main message or insights in your visualization can confuse your audience. Make sure your visualization has a clear purpose and is designed in a way that effectively conveys the intended information.Overcomplicating the design: Complex and cluttered visualizations can overwhelm viewers and make it difficult to extract meaningful insights. Keep your design simple, decluttered, and focused on the most important elements of the data.Choosing inappropriate chart types: Selecting a chart or graph that doesn't align with your data or message can misrepresent the information. Make sure to choose the appropriate chart type that best represents the relationships and patterns in your data.Inaccurate or misleading representations: Misleading or distorted visual representations can lead to incorrect interpretations. Ensure that your axes, scales, and data points accurately reflect the underlying data and don't mislead your audience.Ignoring the audience's needs: Failing to consider the needs, preferences, and knowledge level of your audience can result in visualizations that are ineffective or confusing to interpret. Tailor your visualizations to match the audience's background and the insights they seek.Ineffective use of color: Misusing color can hinder understanding and create confusion. Use color purposefully to highlight key information, create visual distinctions, or represent specific categories. Avoid using excessive or clashing colors that distract from the data.Lack of context and annotations: Data visualizations should provide sufficient context and explanatory elements to guide interpretation. Include titles, captions, legends, and axis labels to provide context, definitions, and explanations.Poor data labeling: Inadequate labeling or missing data labels can make it difficult for viewers to understand the information being presented. Ensure that data points, categories, and values are clearly labeled to prevent ambiguity.Ignoring accessibility: Failing to consider accessibility features can exclude individuals with visual impairments or other disabilities from accessing and understanding your visualizations. Provide alternative text descriptions for images, use appropriate contrast, and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.Lack of testing and feedback: Skipping the testing and feedback phase can lead to missed opportunities for improvement. Test your visualizations with sample users, gather feedback, and iterate on your design to enhance its effectiveness. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can create data visualizations that are clear, accurate, and impactful, enabling your audience to easily understand and gain insights from the presented data."},{"instruction":"My family wants to put my cat down.

Do they just deny the facts?","output":"I can‚Äôt speak for ‚Äúgun fanatics‚Äù. We are just a humble gun violence research organization (neither pro-gun not anti-gun, just pro-math and anti B.S.). My set of responses would be from an analytic and experience standpoint, and would be these: Show me the studies: The summary is insufficient to acknowledge.Summarize the two common critical research components of each: If you do not know what those two components are, then you cannot properly review the works.Are there two or more defects in either or both of those two components: If so, then the study is to be rejected. Chapter ten of our book [LINKED_TEXT: Guns and Control] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510760075/] is a review of how to evaluate research on gun policy. We open the chapter with this quote from an academic who has been both a review judge and published many papers: ‚ÄúPeer review, on which lay people place great weight, varies from being an important control, where the editors and the referees are competent and responsible, to being a complete farce.‚Äù The point is that within research fields, there is a lot of junk. Just a couple of years ago, one wag got six completely bogus papers published in peer review journals. Our 25 years reviewing gun policy papers leads us to believe there is a tremendous amount of junk ‚Äúscience‚Äù in this field. So much so we have a page at the [LINKED_TEXT: Gun Facts] [URL: http://www.gunfacts.info/] website where we list studies that got media attention but which were defective. My favorite was a paper that claimed one form of gun control reduced homicides. The paper itself used synthetic modeling to create crime statistic out of thin air. In these United States, we have a fairly robust crime data collection system, so there is no need to invent numbers. But it gets worse. All models, including synthetic models, are based on one or more assumptions. The biggest assumption in this paper‚Äôs model was the conclusion of another paper. However, that paper had been withdrawn, which typically occurs when the author is confronted with errors that invalidate their conclusions (despite the paper previously having passed peer review). So a flawed study fed another flawed study. Much of the junk research on guns comes from the medical community. They publish not in criminology journals (where their inappropriate methods and horrific data sources would be critiqued) but in medical journals where their peers, who lack backgrounds in criminology and statistics, rubber stamp the conclusions. The Michael Bloomberg School of Public Health at John Hopkins is the most frequent offender, and as we all know, Bloomberg is the bank for gun control advocacy groups. In short, the proof (or lack of proof) is not in accepting some headline about 130 studies. The proof is in reading as many of those studies as you can, from a statistical criminology perspective, and then seeing how many pass this critical test."},{"instruction":"w do we plan to build a Moon base while we can't successfully recreate a moon base on Earth (e.g. Biosphere 2)?","output":"Apples and oranges.

Yes, this is actually a silly question. Why would anyone go to the doctor when they are not sick? What do copays and deductibles have to do with going to the doctor when healthy? I‚Äôm sure there are some lost souls for whom a doctor might be a comfort. However, a doctor has lots of demands on his or her time seeing people who do require care. Our lost soul might require care, mental care possibly that he/she could be referred to. Define Excessively. Someone who needs care will be seen. They might need multiple follow ups.

Space.com says that :- One possible solution, which theorists borrowed from nuclear physicists in the 1970s, is to get rid of the problematic, point-like graviton particles. Strings, and only strings, can collide and rebound cleanly without implying physically impossible infinities. \\"A one-dimensional object ‚Äî that's the thing that really tames the infinities that come up in the calculations,\\" said Marika Taylor, a theoretical physicist at the University of Southampton in England. String theory turns the page on the standard description of the universe by replacing all matter and force particles with just one element: Tiny vibrating strings that twist and turn in complicated ways that, from our perspective, look like particles. But string theory has lately come under greater scrutiny. Most of its predictions are untestable with current technology, and many researchers have wondered if they're going down a never-ending rabbit hole.

However, it's important to note that diabetes is a complex condition, and it is always recommended to consult with a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner or healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some of the commonly used Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes: 1. Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia): Bitter melon is known for its blood sugar-lowering properties. It contains compounds that help improve insulin secretion and utilization, thus aiding in diabetes management. Bitter melon can be consumed as a vegetable, juice, or in supplement form. 2. Gurmar (Gymnema sylvestre): Gurmar, also known as the \\"sugar destroyer,\\" is an herb that has been used in Ayurveda to support healthy blood sugar levels. It helps reduce sugar cravings and may support insulin production. Gurmar is commonly consumed as a tea or in supplement form. 3. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum): Cinnamon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and regulate blood sugar levels. Including cinnamon in your diet or taking it as a supplement can be beneficial for diabetes management. 4. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek seeds are rich in soluble fiber and have been found to help lower blood sugar levels. They can be consumed as a spice in cooking or soaked in water overnight and consumed on an empty stomach. 5. Indian Gooseberry (Emblica officinalis): Indian gooseberry, also known as Amla, is a rich source of vitamin C and antioxidants. It may help improve glucose metabolism, support pancreatic function, and enhance insulin sensitivity. It's important to remember that Ayurvedic medicine is holistic and focuses on an individual's overall well-being. Lifestyle modifications, diet, and exercise also play a crucial role in managing diabetes. Therefore, it is advisable to seek guidance from a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner who can provide a personalized treatment plan based on your specific needs, medical history, and dosha imbalance.

To take one easy example from Berkshire‚Äôs 2018 10K (annual report): Derivative contracts may require significant cash settlement payments and result in significant losses in the future. Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts. The contracts remaining at year end 2018 will expire from 2019 through 2025. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major US and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in settlement payments that significantly exceed the year end 2018 intrinsic value of the contracts (1.7 billion), recorded fair value (2.45 billion) or the premiums we received at inception (4.0 billion.)

Most of the time, I would just listen and sometimes would give some random unsolicited advice which was ignored. The calls always ended leaving me drained, and exhausted. I killed too much of my valuable time entertaining him. That would leave me with less time for myself and MY people. Eventually, they got married, and he became a contact limited to Facebook. I now see that I acted as only a ‚Äòsoundboard‚Äô. In the last one or two years, I have redefined friendship. What do I expect? What can I offer? Now, it is not a one-side effort, but two-way traffic where I listen AND I am being heard. This has left me with only a handful of people, with whom I can talk without any fear of judgment. Yesterday, I had a call with my friend, and the after-effects were therapeutic. I think that it‚Äôs the same for her because she makes a conscious effort to call me amidst her busy schedule. For me, the definition of friendship has evolved. And I get bits and pieces of it from those handfuls of people. For you, it can be something else. What is important is to be aware that anything that brings joy needs to be accepted, and the opposite has to be discarded. Life is too short to spend time with anything/anyone that drains you.

I would not hesitate to fire such a person, which is exactly what I did when several of my husband‚Äôs employees refused to work alone with women. I had to step in to manage the construction company my husband Tony took over when his dad retired, as he had recently started his own business. One of the problems I had to deal with was a bunch of laborers who thought the work was beneath them. They all knew what the job entailed when they accepted it, but when they showed up to work and saw that the trained construction workers were getting paid a whole lot more and were in charge of them, they all wanted to be carpenters, painters, etc. The foremen had to fight with them to get them to stay in their lane, and they were always pestering me for promotions or raises, even after less than a month on the job. I kept them while I advertised for new laborers, and two women hesitantly replied. I made it clear that there was no possibility that they‚Äôd be promoted or receive training, though a raise was possible after three months. They were ecstatic to get 13/hour plus transportation to and from the sites, as the minimum wage here was 7. I hired them both and put each in charge of a crew of laborers, and they were getting shit done, even as they had to deal with non-stop insubordination. They spread the word, and within a month I had crews of laborers that were 80 percent female. I did not discriminate based on gender, and I hired a few new people who were men, but I had ample cause to dismiss the first batch. After that I simply hired the first suitable applicants who were willing to accept the terms, and they just happened to be mostly female. There was no longer any grumbling about how they‚Äôd rather be putting up Sheetrock, and it‚Äôs a sad reflection on our society that they were much better than the men at cleaning up. I remember watching one guy sweep the floor, and it was obvious that he measured his success by how much of the floor the broom touched; it made no difference to him if he actually picked up the thick layer of drywall dust. Things ran smoothly among the laborers. The labor forewomen were excellent at delegating, and unlike the men they weren‚Äôt afraid to lead by example. One woman in particular was careful to always do the nastiest and least desirable jobs herself (like when homeless people break in and poop in the toilets that aren‚Äôt hooked up yet), and we had several clients who were impressed when they saw how many women we employed. Sometimes running a business feels like you‚Äôve turned the old saying on its head, and that closing the door on one problem opens a window for another one. In this case we started to have issues with the male construction workers. They were all quite happy with the women at first, because of how hard they worked, but then their male privilege started to seep in, and they began to treat the laborers as personal maids. When we had to get on to them for abusing the women by making them perform tasks outside of the scope of their responsibilities, some of the guys became resentful. They realized that they had no legitimate complaints against any of the women, so a group of the men who had been with the company for years decided to take a stand by refusing to be alone with them. None of them cited Graham, and it was before Pence, but their argument was the same: It would be improper for them to work alone with a woman when they were married. They made ridiculous demands, like wanting another male to be present if a laborer had to work in a room they were in, or the laborer had to wait until they were gone. We also offered company trucks to some of these men, and though there were vans for the laborers, I did require that anyone driving one of our vehicles pick up another employee if that made more logistical sense. Suddenly I had three men announce that they would no longer be picking up the women we asked them to, and that they would not do runs for materials with female laborers either. There were eight guys total who refused to work alone with women, and three of those drove company trucks. There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that they thought they could get away with it and force me to get rid of the women because they had worked for the company longer than I had been alive. They were skilled workers and supervisors, and they thought they were more valuable to us than the laborers. I called them into a meeting one day and they all made excuses for not showing up, so the next day I kept their paychecks at the office and told them they‚Äôd get them after they met with me. They showed up and acted like the meeting was an opportunity to reiterate their grievances and state demands, and at that point I became excited at the prospect of firing them. I mentally reviewed all the complaints the women had filed against them, and their refusal to carry out the job they were hired to do, and I decided I was on solid ground. When I told them that they had one last chance to agree to work with whoever I assigned I was counting on them to refuse, and they did. The oldest guy who had worked there when my father-in-law started the company said that they were just exercising their religious rights and right to free expression, and that they‚Äôd all quit if I fired one of them ‚Äì and they‚Äôd sue. The problem with that was that the constitution doesn‚Äôt give anyone the right to get paid for a job that they are refusing to do, and that they‚Äôd given me plenty of cause to fire them, even if I didn‚Äôt actually need it. They were incredulous when I responded by telling them that they were out effective immediately, and that they were welcome to sue though I felt they should be aware that I had documented every complaint against them and every time they refused to work. They knew well enough that they had crossed the line in the way they had spoken to their female coworkers, so that put an abrupt end to any talk of lawsuits. I was still sitting at my desk deciding who to promote to take their places, and which temporary workers I should offer permanent employment, when my father-in-law called. The guys had called him the moment they left, asking him to rein me in and whining that I was ruining the company with my feminist agenda. I told him what had happened and he cracked up laughing. Apparently the two men who had been leading the morality crusade were currently spending their paychecks in a New Orleans strip club, just as they had done every Friday for the past three decades."},{"instruction":"Will Akhilesh Yadav be able to form his government this time in the Uttar Pradesh 2022 elections?","output":"This is yet to convert the enthusiasm of the into interested voters.

Somewhere deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico is an upwelling of magma in the mantle. This is what caused the area to sink and spread out forming the Gulf of Mexico. This upwelling brings up with it a large number of things including a lot of Methane! The Methane as it approaches the surface undergoes dehydrogenation synthesis because it encounters at fairly shallow depth a lot of catalytic compounds. In the presence of heat, pressure and these catalytic minerals the methane decomposes somewhat from CH4 to CH3 and CH2. These almost instantly polymerize into what you know as Alkanes or simply stated crude oil. Why so much. Because a lot of methane is coming up there. So much methane that it has coated the bottom of the abyssal deep there about 300 feet thick with methane hydrate. (methane ices) The amount of methane coming up there vastly exceeds any geologic fossil content of the rock by probably 100 times. Furthermore that abyssal deep is so deep there is very little fossil deposit there. So anyone claiming it is dinosaurs or algae that caused this is just wrong. It isn‚Äôt even possible. Now that you have found out why please understand that the area is fairly boiling with methane and crude oil. The seeps of oil are something close to 100,000 barrels of oil a day and may be much more. The seeps of methane are probably more every day than the entire world industry uses every day. There is no shortage and isn‚Äôt going to be one. All we do by not using this oil is that we forgo the energy we could have gotten. It doesn‚Äôt stop the CO2 in the atmosphere at all. This is not the only location that is so. These occur all around the globe. What is more it is just foolish not to use them. We are not going to run out of oil! It is in mass production all the time. Mankind just uses the oil, he doesn‚Äôt make it. For your billion year old earth people, this is a stunning proof that it isn‚Äôt that old. The process is dynamic and on going and the C-14 content indicates a geologic age of about 40,000 years. That is not possible in a billion year old earth. There would be NO C-14 in this stuff if it was that old. Take it or leave it that‚Äôs the facts. It is in fact the seeping up of methane and oil process that built our atmosphere and seas and it fed the life on earth. Even today about 30% of all the fish and sea mammals depend for their spawning and life processes on the out fall of this leaking of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. It is no threat to life, it is life!"},{"instruction":"w can we find stocks for swing trading and positional trading?","output":"Swing and positional trading can be profitable strategies for investors looking to maximize returns without constantly monitoring the market. To find stocks for swing trading, traders often rely on technical analysis to identify trends and support and resistance levels.

Here are some key points to consider: High Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, and their values can experience significant fluctuations in short periods. This volatility can present both opportunities and risks. If you're considering investing in cryptocurrencies, you should be prepared for the potential risks and price swings associated with this asset class.

However, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable. Diversification: Cryptocurrencies can provide an opportunity to diversify your investment portfolio by adding an asset class that behaves differently from traditional stocks and bonds. Diversification can help spread risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio performance. Technological Innovation: Investing in cryptocurrencies can provide exposure to blockchain technology and its potential for disrupting various industries. If you believe in the long-term transformative power of blockchain, investing in cryptocurrencies may align with your investment thesis. Regulatory and Security Risks: Cryptocurrencies operate in a relatively unregulated space, and regulatory changes can impact the market and investor sentiment. Additionally, security risks, including the potential for hacking or theft, should be carefully considered. Understanding and Research: Investing in cryptocurrencies requires a solid understanding of the technology, market trends, and the specific cryptocurrencies you're interested in. Thorough research and staying informed about the latest developments are crucial to making informed investment decisions. Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are generally considered high-risk due to the market's volatility and uncertainties. It's important to assess your risk tolerance and only invest funds that you can afford to lose. It's recommended to approach cryptocurrency investments with caution and consider seeking advice from financial professionals or experienced investors. They can provide insights tailored to your specific circumstances and help you evaluate whether investing in cryptocurrencies aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance."},{"instruction":"Why did the IMF loan money to Greece in the first place?","output":"The reason the IMF got involved with Greece is that is what it was set up to do.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"Both have their advantages and disadvantages. To begin with, in private schools class sizes are usually smaller than in public schools. This can be advantageous for students because they will be more engaged during classes and student-teacher interaction will be more efficient. Moreover, private schools are better equipped with different supplies, such as books, science equipment, and technology, while public schools usually have limited equipment and textbooks might be outdated. Better supplies give students an opportunity to better learn different subjects, thus, increasing the quality of the education that they get. However, most private schools are paid, while public schools are not. Therefore, not every student will be able to afford to attend private schools. Public schools are advantageous in the sense, that they offer a wider range of courses in different fields, like sports, arts, etc. while private schools offer more specialized courses. A wider range of courses will allow students to develop in various directions. Also, private schools usually put more pressure on students academic-wise than public schools do. This pressure can cause high levels of stress for students, which is not good for their health. Additionally, private schools have entrance exams, while public schools do not. Therefore, public schools give all students a chance to study and learn things.

Even when I'm writing this answer, I am discussing some personal issues with him, and he is initiating the process within me, and I am optimistic that after sometime I shall be able to initiate this myself.Moreover, when I just get initiated, I get to know how self-confidence helps me. So, how can self-confidence help anyone?Frankly speaking, if you are asking this question to yourself, then also you ought to answer with confidence from within. You can now surely think where self-confidence helps us. Didn't get it?Okay, no problem. So, self confidence helps an individual in all aspects of his life, whether he's dating a girl or babysitting a child, Whether he's playing football or whether he's cheering up for any team, Whether he likes himself or whether he love himself. Everywhere you see yourself, it's because you had self-confidence. Then why don't you feel that you have self-confidence?Because you have never seen it that way. Try and even learn to see yourself in the situation thinking that self-confidence is helping you in that situation, and I promise that you shall soon feel self-confidence. Sometimes, confidence needs to break the walls of your soul to come out, let them come out dude! This is possible only when you will be self-introspecting yourself. This requires a initiation, just like in my case, Mr. Anga helps me to initiate it. It might take many days, even many months to let you know that you too have self confidence. When you figure it out, you shall truly know that it helps you everywhere."},{"instruction":"What would happen if Klingons encountered Xenomorphs from the Alien movies?","output":"Klingons do not exist in the Alien universe, so this would not happen."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","output":"Here are some tips to help you along the way: Start early: Begin working on your thesis as soon as possible.

If you feel your getting abused, and sensing something isn't right whether the abuse is still on going or not, fear, embarrassment or feeling isolated may prevent you. You may want to tell someone, but you know what they will tell you to do. They'll tell you to leave, if you haven't already. If you have left they may just say ‚Äú good\\" and that's it. But some maybe willing to listen. Explaining any abuse takes a lot of courage from the abused. Trying to explain it to a friend or family member can be difficult for them to understand and for you to explain it in a comprehensive manor because everything will be so mixed up. If a friend or family member can understand you and is willing to spend time, I don't just mean an hour or so, I'm talking weeks and months because this abuse has no quick fix, then you need to try to start from the beginning and go from there. It will be upsetting, you'll go through so many emotions. You may even be in denial that it was all the narcs fault, you'll blame yourself, you may even loose temper or get annoyed with the very person who's trying to help you. It's effects are destroying you from the inside out, changing the very person you are, making you act irrationally, being constantly tired and irritable. This is what abuse does. If your friend or family member knows this behaviour isn't who you really are, they will understand and try to comfort you and listen and advise as best they can. You need moral and emotional support, friends and family members, may not be enough. You may also need professional help. When explaining your abuse, there will be so much to say and as much as you try to remain calm, you won't. You'll say so much so quickly because you need to vent it, then return back to some things you said to go over them again. You will have to relive it again by talking, but the more you talk the less this abuse will be allowed to control you. True friends and family members won't need you to explain the abuse your going through or have been through, they will already see it in you. Talking with other people who have been through a similar situation also helps and you may find it's easier to do it that way. People need people in times of truma, someone to listen, understand and advise. Explaining this abuse and it's effects takes time, a lot of time and energy, both from the abused and the person who's willing to help."},{"instruction":"Which rock band has had the most messed up/dysfunctional history?","output":"Interesting question, but frankly, those that are probably the most dysfunctional are the least well known, simply because they didn‚Äôt last long enough to be recognized.

Find local companies. Possible strategies for finding prospects: Get a Book of Lists for your town. Grab your local Chamber‚Äôs business directory, or visit the Chamber and grab one of every brochure in the rack. Or just drive through a local business park or your nearest downtown shopping district, and make a list of local business company names. If you‚Äôre just starting out in copywriting, or in Web-content writing, I recommend focusing on companies in your town. You‚Äôre more likely to be able to make a connection with a company you can come down and meet with in person. If you have a special knowledge area ‚Äî legal, retail, nonprofit, accounting, whatever ‚Äî further narrow your search to companies in that industry. You may not have Web content samples, but maybe you have articles, brochures or other work in their industry, which would help pave the way to convincing them you‚Äôre the writer for the assignment. How can you zero in on better-paying clients? Try to get a sense from their site of the value of what they sell. What do you think this company makes in a year? A medium-sized law firm, for instance, likely has a very healthy cash flow. A successful, growing retailer with multiple locations ‚Äî same. You can also do Google searches to see if the company has gotten any press, and if so, if they mentioned company revenue. In my experience, business-to-business companies are more desirable targets than consumer-focused companies‚Ä¶it may be me, but they seem to more often have substantial marketing budgets. If a company sells 500,000 engines to automotive companies, they‚Äôre probably a better target than one that sells 5 toys at craft fairs. Prioritize companies that are good candidates for ongoing work ‚Äî they constantly introduce new products, or want to keep a blog updated weekly. Steady clients that will have work each month are always more desirable ‚Äî and end up generating more revenue ‚Äî than those seeking to simply add a few new Web pages to their site and call it done. 2. Look online. Now take your list and find all the company Web sites in your target geography and industries. Take a browse through them. Shortly, it will become clear to you that some of their sites are awesome and detailed, while some have real problems. The losers have important pieces missing ‚Äî no strong ‚ÄúAbout us‚Äù page, no team bios, no details on what their products or services do and how they benefit customers. Reading the site, you can‚Äôt figure out what they do, how long they‚Äôve been in business, who their clients are, who the people are running the company. These are your prospects. 3. Prepare a pitch. Take notes about the state of the Web sites. ABC company has no verbiage whatever on their home page, just a list of links! XYZ company has no media page with press contacts. RFQ company has a blog set up, but it hasn‚Äôt been updated in three months. And so on. Create a pitch tailored for each one that goes something like this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to introduce myself ‚Äî I‚Äôm a local freelance writer. I was looking at your Web site recently, and noticed it doesn‚Äôt have ______. I‚Äôd be happy to take a few minutes to talk with you about how adding a ___ to your Web site would help drive more traffic to your site/get your company noticed/build your reputation and bring you more clients.‚Äù (If you haven‚Äôt pitched companies before, know that everything you say should tie in to the company finding more business. That is why they hire writers ‚Äî they‚Äôre hoping your words will attract more customers.) 4. Call or email prospects. I‚Äôve had good luck with both methods of reaching out, but do whatever you feel suits your personal communication style. Some writers give great phone, while some craft really catchy emails that get results. To start, identify the businesss owner (if it‚Äôs a small biz) or the marketing manager (if it‚Äôs a medium to larger one). Find their phone number or email address, and get in touch. 5. Have examples. If you don‚Äôt have examples of your own Web content work, just find a few sites that you think are well-done (by competitors of your target, ideally) so you can show them what effective content looks like and point up how their site is lacking in comparison. Business owners don‚Äôt like to feel they look lame when compared with similar businesses. 6. Be prepared to build a relationship. In my experience, your first contact with a small business about writing Web content will often not result in an instant sale (though sometimes it does!). More often, you may need to have several conversations that may string out over weeks or months as the company decides exactly what new content should be written. Start a tracking system for staying in touch periodically with these prospects. Send them interesting articles about why adding a blog would help their business‚Ä¶don‚Äôt necessarily hard-sell them every time you chat. Don‚Äôt invest a ton of time, as this may or may not pay off, but show you‚Äôre a useful resource who knows about how to use the Internet to help businesses grow. This week, I‚Äôm finally signing a lucrative contract with one financial-services consultant who I‚Äôve been speaking with all year. 7. Quote a decent rate. Web-content rates are all over the map. If you‚Äôre new, start at 100 a page at least. And know that Web pages should be short ‚Äî 300-400 words is plenty. If they have more to say, they should create subpages (which you should also charge 100 for!). They want blogs? Think 100 per. Pay can range up to 1 a word, 150 an hour, and more in my experience. Rates will depend on the complexity of the information you need to convey on the company site. Need to write about foreign currency trading or actuarial consulting? It‚Äôs probably going to pay more than writing about a pizza parlor. But remember: If you quote a lowball rate, you‚Äôll write for low rates. Try to get the client to mention a budget first, and then negotiate from there. Stick to your guns on what you think is fair pay."},{"instruction":"What do you think about Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to create new manufacturing jobs and boost American production?

In fact the same is the case with many other species in existence today. The rational evidence regarding origin of all humans beings from a single pair of man and woman is evident from the fact that we all have spiritual instinct (seeking some ideal), we all have a sense of morality and we all have rational method of thinking.

It means that humans have been specifically created in this form, rather than an entire population of humans evolving ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù from an entire population of prehuman apes, and somehow all of them ending up having these exalted characteristics.

Capable of very high speed machining due to it's high heat conductivity removing frictional heat from the cutting zone. Typical machining issue is development of a build-up on the edge of the cutting tool, this can lead to tool breakage. Chip evacuation can be a problem in drills and narrow slots.Magnesium. Machinability similar to aluminium, however suffers from the issue that the swarf is flammable, very fine chips and shavings may be highly flammable if dry. Once ignited, a magnesium fire is extremely difficult to extinguish and water based fire extinguishers should never be used on magnesium. Water based flood coolant is mandatory. Mg is easy to machine from a theoretical standpoint but challenging to machine from the standpoint of fire safety.Copper- good machinability, however commercially pure copper may produce long, stringy, gummy chips. Higher strength low alloy copper such as Cu-Be or Cu-Cr alloys tend to have better machinability.Brass. Excellent machinability. Machinability rating of 100%, serves as a standard to which other materials are compared in their machinability.Bronze- depends on the alloy. Machinability generally good.

Microsoft is. But the book? It's ok, but probably not as impressive as he made it out to be. About the book. Art of Computer Programming is a brilliant book, written by a brilliant programmer. And rather useless for a productive programmer. You have to understand, most of the time, the challenge isn't ‚Äúhow can we solve this in polynomial time?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat's the most efficient way to do this?‚Äù Don't get me wrong, understanding of fundamental of computer science is vital. But you don't answer that kind of challenge frequently. If you get it like once a year, it's already fun. After all, programmers are software engineers, not computer science researchers. Firm grasp of the science helps, just don't expect to reach into its edges too often. To put this in perspective, it's like saying ‚Äúif you understand insert-a-physic-book, come work with us in General Motor.‚Äù Well, you definitely want to to know the sciences. But again, you won't be trying to rework those equations frequently. Most of the time, your challenge is ‚ÄúOK, we need this out next month, except you have no extra resources (and the ones you have are fully booked), while the data owner won‚Äôt be able to grant extra access and if you even think about asking for certain data, security and legal will want to grill you over (except both of them are booked up for months).‚Äù It‚Äôs time optimization, alright. But it‚Äôs time of the organization, not of the computer. Most of the time, the biggest challenge of your code isn‚Äôt ‚Äúis it correct‚Äù? (goodness I hope you don‚Äôt have to think about that!) The biggest challenge of your code is either ‚ÄúOMG what the hell did the previous guy mean?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the sequence of deployment which carries the least risk?‚Äù or ‚Äúsecurity demands you upgrade your runtime environment, which breaks half of the units of your product, and you have around 24h to get everything in working order.‚Äù Also, a sh*t load of ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù problem isn‚Äôt about the code per se, but about everything else. Think about the concept of ‚Äútest flakiness‚Äù (i.e. tests failing randomly). As far as most of computer science is concerned, such thing is‚Ä¶ against the spirit of computer science. However, tests and production fail for a variety of reasons outside of the code. The computer craps out (because it‚Äôs a hot day and the damned thing overheat? because the other tenants of your racks get higher priority? because OMG how many customers did you say we have this launch?). Networks randomly corrupt your data, just because. Some sloppy newbie programmers (read: you at 2AM trying to rescue some data) introduce bad code (or, worse yet, insert some wrongly formatted data). None of these problems can be accounted for by an elegant proof that your algorithm is correct. I mean, they can, and should, be accounted for, but through a process called ‚Äúelbow grease‚Äù wherein you painstakingly put in contingency code for every, single, edge, cases. See how Art of Computer Programming doesn‚Äôt help? So the book is ok, but not vital. Then why did Bill Gates mention it? There are 2 main reasons, I think. First, since the book is pretty dense, he wants to advertise the fact that he (and Microsoft) highly values people who can process that kind of information. Second, he also wants to show Microsoft to be a highly desirable place to work, and only the smartest are allowed. In short, PR. I mean, I know there is Microsoft Research, which is rumored to be pretty into stretching the limit of computer science. But regular departments? Look, Windows is full of hacks and backward-bending for certain programs to work. And let‚Äôs not talk about Office (and the atrocity that is VBA). So the book is probably useless there.

No more playing Santa using tax money to buy minority votes.No more double standards with respect to minorities‚Äô religion. Catholicism has been completely mocked, ridiculed and demonized. Nuns have been bullied out of the boards of the charities they themselves built with their bare hands. By whom? Smug uber-secularist knowitall types. The same types who have got absolutely no problem with rabid religious conservatism when it happens to come from Muslims. You know, because Allah is real and God is not. On more than one occasion, Muslims from the Belgian far Left (most of whom have double nationality) have been exposed of having ties to the far right wing in their ancestral countries. ‚ÄúEt alors?‚ÄùNo more ‚Äúshushing‚Äù the right. Whenever someone sticks up for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), immediately he or she is accused of being a monster because of a totally unrelated issue, such as child poverty. (That‚Äôs the latest incarnation of that argument.) Actually it is related: Without these SMEs and the >50% total tax rate they already pay, there would not be any money to alleviate child poverty.No more pretending you don‚Äôt know what communism is or does. If you are going to levy a ginormous corporate tax rate on those big evil multinational corporations, they will all simply go away.No more sitting on one‚Äôs Leftist high horse while collaborating with the PS, who steal from the homeless; or Ecolo, who are a crypto conservative Muslim party but lack the bravery and decency to advertize it in the open.

All of these points are left v. right wing, but those supposedly right-wing issues (rather than romantic nationalism) is what is actually driving the separatist movement‚Ä¶ Honestly, Bart De Wever as prime minister would be in the best interest of Belgicists (unitary Belgians). But the PS won‚Äôt ever allow it unless he‚Äôd go on his knees in front of Magnette. Somebody needs to tell the PS that this isn‚Äôt the 19th century anymore, if that somebody actually cares about the preservation of Belgium. Most people don‚Äôt care about nationalism either way (pro Flemish or pro Belgian). It‚Äôs about ‚Äúbread and butter‚Äù issues for them.

Most secessions happen for ‚Äúbread and butter issues‚Äù to begin with! About a union with the Netherlands in the event of an independent Flanders‚Ä¶ I think there would be an immediate demand for increased cooperation in the field of transportation and perhaps education. But in terms of ‚Äúcommunication culture‚Äù, the Netherlands is rather direct, while Flanders is almost Asian (think 10 things before you say 1 thing)‚Ä¶ Also, dialect-wise and culturally, the Netherlands is more homogenized than Flanders.

Listen to me, Dhananjaya! This that I will tell thee will immediately dispel thy sorrow and infuse delight into thy heart. O thou of great splendour, know, O Dhananjaya, that Karna, his dart being baffled through Ghatotkacha, is already slain in battle. The man does not exist in this world that could not stay before Karna armed with that dart and looking like Kartikeya in battle. By good luck, his (natural) armour had been taken away. By good luck, his earrings also had been taken away. By good luck, his infallible dart also is now baffled, through Ghatotkacha. Clad in (natural) coat of mail and decked with his (natural) ear-rings, Karna, who had his senses under control, could singly vanquish the three worlds with the very gods. Neither Vasava, nor Varuna the lord of the waters, nor Yama, could venture to approach him. Indeed, if that bull among men had his armour and ear-rings, neither thyself, bending the Gandiva, nor myself, uplifting my discus, called Sudarsana, could vanquish him in battle. For thy good, Karna was divested of his ear-rings by Sakra with the help of an illusion. Similarly was that subjugator of hostile towns deprived of his (natural) armour. Indeed, because Karna, cutting off his (natural) armour and his brilliant car-rings, gave them unto Sakra, it is for that he came to be called Vaikartana. Karna now seems to me to be like an angry snake of virulent poison stupefied by power of [LINKED_TEXT: incantation] [URL: https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/errata.htm#114], or like a fire of mild flames. From that time, O mighty-armed one, when the high-souled Sakra gave that dart unto Karna in exchange for the latter's ear-rings, and celestial armour, that dart, viz., which has slain Ghatotkacha, from that time, Vrisha, having obtained it, had always regarded thee as slain in battle! But though [LINKED_TEXT: deprived] [URL: https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/errata.htm#115] of that dart, O sinless one, I swear to thee that hero is still incapable of being slain by anybody else save thee. Devoted to Brahmanas, truthful in speech, engaged in penances, observant of vows, kind even unto foes, for these reasons Karna is called Vrisha. Heroic in battle, possessed of mighty arms and with bow always uplifted, like the lion in the forest depriving leaders of elephantine herds of their pride, Karna always deprives the greatest car-warriors of their pride on the field of battle, and resembles the mid-day sun at whom none can gaze. Contending with all the illustrious and foremost of warriors of thy army, O tiger among men, Karna, while shooting his arrowy showers, looked like the autumnal sun with his thousand rays. Indeed, incessantly shooting showers of shafts like the clouds pouring torrents of rain at the end of summer, Karna is like a pouring cloud charged with celestial weapons. He is incapable of being vanquished in battle by the gods, he would mangle them in such a way that their flesh and blood would fall copiously on the field. Deprived, however, of his armour as also of his car-rings, O son of Pandu, and divested also of the dart given him by Vasava, Karna is now like a man (and no longer like a god). There win occur one opportunity for his slaughter. When his car-wheels will sink in the earth, availing thyself of that opportunity, thou shouldst slay him in that distressful situation. I will make thee a sign beforehand. Warned by it, thou shouldst act. The vanquisher of Vala himself, that foremost of heroes, wielding his thunder, is incapable of slaying the invincible Karna while the latter stands weapon in hand. Indeed, O Arjuna, for thy good, with the aid of diverse contrivances I have slain, one after another, Jarasandha and the illustrious ruler of the Chedis and the mighty-armed Nishada of the name of Ekalavya There are still many instances.

However, if one looks at the other side of Mumbai, the city is highly rich in religious traditions and the spiritual places of worship associated with several religions form an integral part of Mumbai. Every part of Mumbai city has either Temple, Church or Mosque. TEMPLES IN MUMBAI Mumba Devi Temple Mumbai itself gets its name after the name of Hindu Goddess, the Mumba Devi, worshipped commonly by the vast fishing community of Mumbai.

They start facing problems in the subject which dearth the preparation. Students generally can‚Äôt give their attention on the main aim and always jumps to different goals. Instead of concentrating on different goals, first, think about one goal and work on it whether it is GATE, CAT, MAT, and GRE anything with your full attention. Never focus on another goal when you focus on one. #2 Improper management of time Many students make time table to study but they do not continue to reply on that timetable. It is because of making a tough timetable and fails to work on it. You must solve those questions first which you know confidently in GATE exam. It is very important to give equal time to every question you can solve to GATE exam. Otherwise, at the end, you will not get a time to solve other question. #3 Lack of practice GATE requires continues the practice to score good marks. You must practice a lot for GATE exam and try to increase you speed of solving the question. Give time in solving a variety of different problems rather than practices similar type of questions. Go through mock tests when you complete the course as much as you can to grab your understanding and level. #4 Less knowledge about the course syllabus of examination pattern Many of students do not aware of the negative marking in GATE exam and get attempt all questions. Some have no clue about the cut-off marks for the examination. Some of them just study which they like in the syllabus and think that question will come from that part only and ignore the difficult parts of the syllabus. You must know that proper pattern and syllabus of GATE exam in order to clear GATE 2017 and do not ignore the hard subject rather start practicing on it. #5 Giving too much time on less important topics Some students have a habit of wasting more time on topics which carry a few marks and leave the main important topics. You must know the important topics which score more marks in GATE exam. The better ways are to make a list of topics on a page and make a priority according to carry more marks. #6 Difficult to follow online exam As GATE is now conducted online exam, so it has been difficult for that student who has the habit of giving offline exams like with paper and pencil. I suggest students to start giving exams online like a mock tests, quizzes Etc. If you practice online then it won‚Äôt be a problem for the student to face the difficulties in GATE 2017 and also helps in manage time and strategies to solve in the exam.

It offers a range of advantages over traditional CMS options and has become an essential tool for modern website and application development. Whether you're an individual blogger, a small business owner, or a large enterprise, understanding why you need to use a Headless CMS is crucial for staying ahead in today's digital landscape. First and foremost, a Headless CMS provides unparalleled flexibility. Unlike traditional CMS platforms that tightly couple the content management and presentation layers, a Headless CMS decouples them completely. This means that the content is stored separately from the front-end presentation, allowing you to deliver content to multiple channels and devices seamlessly. Whether it's a website, a mobile app, a smart device, or even a virtual reality experience, a Headless CMS empowers you to serve your content anywhere and in any format you desire. Also read: [LINKED_TEXT: Best CMS development services] [URL: https://digitaltechworks.com/cms-development/] Furthermore, Headless CMS enables a more efficient content creation and publishing process. With a traditional CMS, content authors and editors are often confined to using the built-in tools and templates, which can be restrictive and time-consuming. In contrast, a Headless CMS allows content creators to work with their preferred tools and workflows, such as popular text editors or specialized content creation software. This flexibility streamlines the content creation process, enhances productivity, and fosters collaboration among team members. Another crucial benefit of using a Headless CMS is its scalability. As your digital presence grows and evolves, you may need to accommodate new platforms, devices, or even integrate emerging technologies. A Headless CMS excels in this regard by providing a future-proof foundation. Since the presentation layer is decoupled, you can update or replace it without affecting the underlying content structure. This scalability ensures that your content remains adaptable to changing user expectations and technological advancements. Moreover, a Headless CMS enables faster and more efficient front-end development. With the separation of content and presentation, developers can focus solely on building robust front-end experiences without the constraints imposed by a traditional CMS. They have the freedom to choose their preferred development frameworks, libraries, and tools, which ultimately leads to faster development cycles and enhanced user experiences. Security is another crucial aspect where a Headless CMS shines. By decoupling the presentation layer, the attack surface for potential vulnerabilities is significantly reduced. Traditional CMS platforms often have a large codebase and various plugins or themes, making them more susceptible to security breaches. On the other hand, a Headless CMS typically has a smaller and more focused codebase, reducing the potential risks and increasing the overall security posture of your digital assets. In conclusion, the benefits of using a Headless CMS are numerous and impactful. Its flexibility, efficiency, scalability, development speed, and security advantages make it an indispensable tool for modern content management and delivery. Whether you're a blogger, an e-commerce business, or an enterprise-level organization, embracing a Headless CMS can transform the way you create, manage, and distribute content across various channels and platforms. To harness the full potential of a Headless CMS, it's essential to partner with a top-notch CMS development company. Such a company possesses the expertise, experience, and technical know-how to assist you in implementing and optimizing your Headless CMS solution. Whether it's customizing the CMS to align with your unique requirements, integrating third-party services, or providing ongoing support, a [LINKED_TEXT: top-notch CMS development company] [URL: https://digitaltechworks.com/cms-development/] can ensure that you leverage the full power of a Headless CMS to elevate your digital presence and achieve your business objectives."},{"instruction":"f I proved th","output":"You have my greatest sympathy.

I saw an article on Facebook yesterday, about a man who had been gored and killed by a deer he was hunting. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #MvIgc]I knew what was coming, but I still decided to look at the comment section. A solid 90% of it was people making jokes about it, but also (100% seriously) saying he deserved it, they‚Äôre glad the deer ‚Äúwon‚Äù etc. Now, it wasn‚Äôt the exact article linked above, but it basically said the same thing. Not much detail, only that he was a hunter in Arkansas. Have I ever been hunting? No. Do I hate the idea of trophy hunting? Yes, it‚Äôs one of my least favourite things. If someone got killed by a lion or an elephant or a rhino they were illegally hunting, would I find that schadenfreude slightly amusing? Probably, yeah. But this wasn‚Äôt any of those things. This was a man legally hunting a deer and, most likely, he was going to eat it. Nothing in the article said he was hunting for ‚Äúsport‚Äù, as many commenters said. I just don‚Äôt understand the knee-jerk reaction to vilify someone and mock their death for hunting their food, especially as the majority of commenters were most likely meat-eaters themselves. I made a comment, saying it was slightly hypocritical of people who eat meat to laugh about a hunter‚Äôs death, when they have no issues picking up meat from the supermarket. Even people who don‚Äôt eat meat can surely see that it is a more sustainable and less environmentally-damaging way to consume animals. If deer are allowed to be hunted, the population is surely healthy, and in some areas, overpopulation is actually a problem, because, without enough predators, the population will explode, and then deer will starve and die anyway. (In lots of cases, we‚Äôre responsible for this lack of predators, which I‚Äôm not thrilled about, but having made this situation we have a responsibility to keep the ecosystem in balance.) ‚ÄúHunting is evil‚Äù is a sweeping generalisation and it makes me a bit irritated that some people can‚Äôt put themselves in someone else‚Äôs shoes. ‚ÄúMan who goes out to feed family‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äútwat who goes fox hunting‚Äù or ‚Äúperson who pays thousands of dollars and travels to the other side of the world to shoot lion.‚Äù The example I used was: what if there‚Äôs a person who lives in e.g. remote Alaska, who hunts elk once a year and then sticks the whole animal in the freezer, where it provides many months‚Äô worth of food? They might live miles from the nearest settlement, and rely on hunting for the bulk of their protein for themselves and their family. Of course, I also said he could just be someone who liked killing things, but nothing in the article gave that impression. Someone told me to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù and that they were ‚Äúlaughing into their bacon sandwich‚Äù about the man‚Äôs death. That person thinks they are the good guy. Another commenter (not replying directly to me) said they were laughing at the man and all of his family and friends. This guy‚Äôs FB profile indicated that he was keen on tolerance, social justice, etc. Nothing wrong with that, but I just find it slightly hypocritical to preach tolerance then laugh at a recently widowed woman, and potentially kids who no longer have a father. (I don‚Äôt think it mentioned whether he had children.) It‚Äôs easy to say hunting is evil when you‚Äôve never had to hunt. If I lived in the rural USA, maybe I would be hunting for my food. If I were an Inuit, I‚Äôd probably be killing whales, or seals. I watched a documentary about (I think) the Faroe Islands and they were snapping the necks of sea birds and ripping their heads off. It was a rare time of year when they could catch them, so they actually had a much-needed source of calories for the following weeks/months. As much as I have a visceral reaction to seeing animals killed, I do understand that these people rely on this to survive, and they‚Äôre making a small dent compared to commercial methods of farming/fishing. I‚Äôm sure that some people living in their comfortable apartment in the city will be happy to call these people monsters, but I just think it shows how out of touch some people are. We‚Äôre still part of nature, and part of nature involves prey animals getting killed. Maybe one day we‚Äôll get some delicious, affordable lab-grown meat that means we don‚Äôt have to kill animals, but until then, one dude hunting a deer isn‚Äôt the problem. I do care about animals and conservation, but eating non-endangered animals isn‚Äôt in conflict with my own moral code. If you choose not to eat meat for moral and/or environmental reasons I totally respect that, but when people say someone deserves to die for hunting their food, that‚Äôs a complete mystery to me. You can‚Äôt say life is precious and then insinuate that human life is worthless. I‚Äôm not a saint, but at least I know I‚Äôm not. I do think we need to slow down on the consumption of meat and improve living conditions for animals we farm. I know I don‚Äôt have to eat meat to survive, but then again I‚Äôm not on Facebook making fun of someone‚Äôs death while somehow feeling righteous about it. I‚Äôd just like people to try and empathise a bit before getting the pitchforks out online. We‚Äôre all flawed, and as soon as you believe you‚Äôre 100% on the side of ‚Äúgood‚Äù and anyone with a differing opinion is 100% ‚Äúbad‚Äù, you‚Äôre in trouble. Unless you like anchovies on pizza. Sorry, there‚Äôs no saving you.

I will narrate one live incident, for a change it is a good Karma that has happened to one of my uncles. One of my uncles son was my classmate during my school days. My uncle is very nice and witty person. His mother was very homely, hospitable and kind lady. We used to call her aayi (grandmother). There are no words to explain her love for me or for anyone. Such a divine lady suffered with a severe paralytic stroke and she lost her consciousness. After hospitalisation and good treatment she recovered to the extent of breathing normally. She could not speak, not recognise or could tell in any way she wants water, food or wants to use toilet. It was very bad condition but she survived. My uncle‚Äôs wife (mami) took care of her. She with her co-sister (and their husbands)looked after her mother-in-law so well that the woman health improved but the woman condition remained exact same. Every evening they familiar with get right up 3 x consequently and used to offer sleep pan. Morning familiar with offer bathtub and feed the woman morning meal, lunch and dinner. She existed for twenty five many years in this exact same problem. They never when complained. Inspite of being in bed for quarter of a hundred years she didn‚Äôt have just one sleep soar.

What do you make of this statement?","output":"All languages are grammar-less as long as we don‚Äôt try to formalize their functioning. People are able to talk in their primary language without having any knowledge about grammar. Children can talk pretty well long before they learn anything about grammar. Grammar is a formal model of how the language works. It can be descriptive or normative. Adults learning a second language generally rely upon normative grammar. This is the reason why any language other than one‚Äôs primary language is generally seen as having a much more complex grammar than one‚Äôs primary language. Richard Grant White probably meant that all other languages have a more complex grammar than English, because he didn‚Äôt need grammar to speak English (although he certainly mastered this subject). Think about languages that are said to have a much more complex grammar than English, such as Finish or Chinese. There is no doubt that a English native will have much more problem to learn these than they had to learn their primary language. But the only reason is that they learn them using grammar. Three years old Finish or Chinese kids, on the other hand, have no problem because they don‚Äôt rely upon grammar to learn the language. Of course, some will argue that people having absolutely no knowledge of grammar do not speak their own primary language very well. But this is a fallacy. A language is what people talk. Normative grammar (which allow determining who speaks ‚Äúwell‚Äù and who doesn‚Äôt) is just descriptive grammar of the past, and/or of a dominant class, promoted to a norm.

Does anyone have any comments? Yes. Don't elaborate on the details of your ‚Äútheory‚Äù here on Quora. Instead, read up the vast literature on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Look up review articles that summarize the observations carried out in the past 54 years. Then, sit down and explain them one by one with your ‚Äútheory.‚Äù You will realize that your ‚Äútheory‚Äù will now need to incorporate numbers, and hence equations, and physics that is already known, tested, and understood. If you do not know that physics, you will have to work hard and get to the bottom of it. Only then can you proceed with formalizing your ‚Äútheory‚Äù to be able to make any quantitative comparison of available GRB data with your idea. If you can explain the observations, and by that I mean match the numbers predicted from your ‚Äútheory‚Äù with all the data and various quantitative features of GRBs reported in literature, then write up your findings in the form of a paper and submit it to a well-ranked journal that publishes findings in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Hope for the best. If you manage to get it published via the rigorous process of peer-review, you will realize that the paper will add to the already existing set of theories explaining gamma-ray bursts. Nevertheless, you will become a scientist in the relatively small field of GRBs, possibly attracting collaboration, funds and projects. Go to relevant conferences and present your good work. Keep it up over the years to test the validity of the new theory as more observations of GRBs are reported. If you cannot take your idea to the level of making quantitative comparisons with data, then please do not call it a ‚Äútheory.‚Äù"},{"instruction":"Can you live in SF Bay Area without a car?","output":"Aside from San Francisco, Oakland is the only place I would consider living without a car.

So I‚Äôd suggest that there isn‚Äôt a definitive answer to your question. At any given time, points could be worth more than miles, or vice versa. There is, however, a general convention in which a credit card point can be redeemed for .01 in cashback or statement credit, and a credit card mile can be redeemed for a .01 credit against airline charges posted to your card. Within this strict confine, the value of each is equivalent. But, going back to Gerber‚Äôs point, he identifies exactly why I typically avoid cards with either point or mile reward accrual. Instead, I largely stick with cards that earn a fixed stated reward (not points), or ones that award airline mileage with a specific airline. In the latter case, airline cards (such as Barclay‚Äôs Aviator ‚Äî Amer Air), still present the vulnerability that the miles necessary to issue a given reward ticket can change. However, at least this is a vulnerability that I‚Äôve already assumed in choosing to participate in that frequent flyer award program. Under this scenario, a limited amount of math is necessary to optimally allocate my personal expenses across my credit cards. Take the following 3 cards in my wallet: Citi Double Cash: 2% cash rebate against all charges Citi Professional: 1% general cash rebate, 3% on dining/travel/office supplies (I‚Äôve simplified a tad here) Barclays Aviator Silver: 95 fee ‚Ä¶ only used for American Air charges, on which I‚Äôm awarded 3 AAdvantage (frequent flyer program) miles. Given my redemption experience over time, I‚Äôm confident of securing .014 value for each AA mile I redeem. It should be clear that in this case, I hold 1 AA mile to be equivalent to .014 cashback from the other two cards. In my personal credit card spend, I‚Äôm going to favor the Citi Prof for the 3% earn categories, the Aviator for American Airlines purchases, and the Double Cash for all other credit card expenditures. So one postscript: I actually actively use Chase Sapphire Reserve for all my dining and travel spend now (rather than Citi Prof). It‚Äôs a points-based card. Now that goes directly against my stated preference to avoid cards that award ‚Äúpoints‚Äù. I‚Äôve made an exception in this case because, even with a hefty annual fee, my annual spend on those categories yields very hefty reward credits ‚Ä¶ The card grants a 3% point reward on those categories. Further, when you redeem the point value (1 pt = .01) towards travel booked on their designated booking site (very similar to Expedia, etc.), they boost the amount credited from redemption of points by 50%. In other words, the ultimate rebate earned on dining/travel spend is 4.5%. Since I actively redeem accrued points by booking travel through their portal, I‚Äôve limited my risk to a revision to point value. Chase Sapphire Reserve had yielded the strongest reward benefits of any card I‚Äôve ever held, even after netting out the annual fee."},{"instruction":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

One of the regular segments featured this fellow who would read satirical news stories And one of the bits that was an immediate hit was his riff on this fellow Francisco Franco, the dictator of Spain. A typical segment would be ‚ÄúThis just in! General√≠simo Francisco Franco of Spain is still dead. More to come.‚Äù Franco‚Äôs death, like Stalin‚Äôs death 20 years earlier, put his immediate allies into turmoil. Technically, Franco had a clear successor, Prince Juan Carlos, the son of the previous King of Spain. However, Franco had been in charge for 40 years at this point and despite the fact Franco had trusted Juan Carlos, things were not as they seemed. You see, Juan Carlos had double crossed Franco. While outwardly supporting Franco and his policies, he had secretly been meeting with oppositon leaders to arrange a peaceful transition back to democracy. When rumours (that were totally true) of Franco‚Äôs death started to leak out, the people who had been loyal to him suddenly saw themselves as looking down the barrel of return to the rule of law. Franco‚Äôs loyalists still controlled the military, but staging a military coup of the new King at the moment of Franco‚Äôs death was not really a viable option. After all, you can‚Äôt stage a coup when the King hasn‚Äôt even taken charge yet. So, in a blatant attempt to keep their authority when it was crumbling around them, Franco‚Äôs loyalists claimed that Franco was just fine thank you very much and that they still held their own offices. However, eventually the truth won out. Juan Carlos finally took control of the government and pushed the Franco loyalists aside, replacing them with hand picked reformers. Now, it appears that rumours of Kim Jong Un‚Äôs death are much exaggerated at this point. South Korean intelligence is already on record as saying that they would expect to see certain things happen if Kim had died which haven‚Äôt happened.

You have to have a thorough understanding of how their system works and they will have to have a certain amount of time to turn it back on. Explain how this is not a possibility and do not say \\"well I can just turn it back on.\\" The utility company will not understand your perspective. They will see this as a threat and will want to shut down your system for a while until you can prove it can be turned back on without a problem.

In reality selection doesn‚Äôt work on the genome but on characters, what is called phenotype. Actually for every molecule, say an enzyme, coded by a gene, many other sequences are possible coding for exactly the same, identical enzyme (see codon synonyms). On the other hand for every enzyme possessing some particular function there are potentially millions of very different enzymes capable of exactly the same function. As a consequence, even when a particular character of two distantly related species converges phenotypically under selection, the probability that an exactly identical molecule has been selected to realize this character is extremely small, and even in the case of this incredible coincidence, the probability that this molecule is coded by an exactly identical sequence is abysmally tiny. All together, two distanctly related species can, and routinely do, become more and more similar to the eye by convergent evolution, but I would exclude the practical possibility that they also become so similar at the genome level that they give the false impression of being more closely related than they are in reality."},{"instruction":"As a proud Texan, I believe that for profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies.

Instead, a small group of representatives, ALSO not selected by general plebiscite, decided amongst their VERY disunited selves, to ALLOW the inclusion of the Second into the Constitution. Even right after the Revolution, leading Americans were already making up, and believing in myths about what had just happened. The fact that a large number of the grievances claimed against the British government were exaggerations, or outright falsehoods, was forgotten; the reasons for the relative success of the Revolution itself were forgotten or misinterpreted (again, for propaganda reasons).

However, it's important to note that sustainable and long-term weight loss is generally more effective and healthier for your body than rapid weight loss. If you're looking to lose weight quickly, here are some tips to consider: 1. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: Before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, it's recommended to consult a doctor or a registered dietitian. They can provide personalized guidance based on your individual health needs. 2. **Create a Calorie Deficit**: Weight loss ultimately comes down to burning more calories than you consume. Calculate your daily calorie needs and aim to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. 3. **Healthy Eating**: Focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie beverages. 4. **Portion Control**: Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excessive amounts. 5. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking enough water can help control your appetite and support your metabolism. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day. 6. **Regular Exercise**: Engage in a combination of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, cycling) and strength training (using weights or resistance bands). Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days. 7. **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**: HIIT workouts involve short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief rest periods. These workouts can help you burn calories more efficiently in a shorter amount of time. 8. **Get Enough Sleep**: Sleep plays a crucial role in weight management and overall health. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. 9. **Manage Stress**: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain. Practice stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or deep breathing. 10. **Avoid Liquid Calories**: Be cautious with high-calorie drinks like sugary sodas, energy drinks, and excessive fruit juices. Opt for water, herbal tea, or other low-calorie beverages. 11. **Track Your Progress**: Keep a record of your food intake, exercise, and weight loss progress. This can help you stay accountable and make necessary adjustments. 12. **Limit Processed Foods**: Processed foods are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sugars. Focus on whole foods to nourish your body and support weight loss. Remember that losing weight too quickly can be unsustainable and potentially harmful to your health. Aim for a gradual and balanced approach to weight loss, and prioritize your overall well-being over quick results.

In my experience, the most useful strategy to learn English pronunciation is to repeat after the model pronunciation using the correct position of tongue, lips and jaw for each English sound. Later work on fluency and articulation. First, record yourself in order to see how you sound to others. Then, identify your mistakes and correct them, practise the correct form, and then record yourself again. Repetition is the key. The reason why we struggle with English punctuation is two-fold: 1. Not all English sounds exist in our native language and we are not sure how to produce them correctly.2. Our speech organs are trained for our native language from our childhood. When we start speaking in English, we don‚Äôt place our tongue, lips and jaw as native English speakers do. When I recorded myself in 2004 I was shocked to realize that even I could not understand what I was saying. Then, I started to look for a speech or elocution tutor who could explain how to position my tongue, lips and jaw for English sounds. I was lucky to find a top tutor in London and I fell in love with her method. We were practising accent reduction with funny sentences and verses, it was very enjoyable and extremely effective. Later, together with Linda, my tutor, we have published [LINKED_TEXT: 5 books] [URL: http://www.batcsglobal.com/british-accent-apps-and-books?__hstc=21858660.1c51716e5ff8ed3a6af782ff89c863d4.1586548688747.1601292997695.1601312670874.545&__hssc=21858660.4.1601312670874&__hsfp=1214202326] to master English punctuation which became international bestsellers.

Here are more difficulties with English pronunciation you might have experienced: 1. Not all English vowels and diphthongs exist in other languages, you might struggle to pronounce them correctly. 2. There are 5 long and 7 short vowels In English. Long vowels do not exist in all languages and there is a tendency to shorten them. This can create a problem for others to understand what you are saying. 3. Bad articulation, in other words, weak consonants or incorrectly pronounced consonants. 4. Your intonation could be very difficult to follow, you might break phrases and make pauses in the wrong places. In order to master English pronunciation you need to : Learn and practice how to pronounce English sounds using received pronunciation (RP). RP is also sometimes called the Queen‚Äôs English, Oxford English or BBC English.Practice articulation exercises to make your consonants clear and crisp.Learn to speak in phrases rather than in separate words; knowing how to link words together correctly.Learn patterns of English intonation and vocal techniques.

Paparazzi can sell their pictures for big money, and their images and antics sell TV spots, Fan Magazines, cosmetics, clothing, and more.

Every atom in nature has these same characteristics. The number of proton(positive)charged parts of nuclide determines it's identity. Example hydrogen has 1 proton(positive charge). Helium has 2 protons(positive charges) Lithium has 3 protons (positive charges) etc to Uranium which has 92. We from magnets positives repel one another,and attract negatives. Bible tells me that God holds everything together. Obviously multiple positive forces against one another would make things fall apart. We call the energy force of God binding energy. Found in every multiple proton nuclide. Oviously more binding energy in larger proton concentration elements. Takes major binding energy to hold Uranium together with 92 proton. Splitting the atom creates 2 new different things,each requiring less binding energy to hold them together. This energy released as heat boils water to make steam. That's how it works.

Why? Because China is all about conflicts, every now and then. Let me quote some facts while I say this. Sikkim conflict in 1967:- * In late 1967, there were two more conflicts between Indian and Chinese forces at their contested border, in Sikkim. The first conflict was dubbed the \\"Nathu La Incident\\", and the other the \\"Cho La Incident\\". * In September 1967, Chinese and Indian forces clashed at Nathu La. On 11 September, Chinese troops opened fire on a detachment of Indian soldiers tasked with protecting an engineering company that was fencing the North Shoulder of Nathu La. * This escalated over the next five days to an exchange of heavy artillery and mortar fire between the Indian and Chinese forces. Sixty-two Indian soldiers were killed. * Soon afterwards, Indian and Chinese forces clashed again in the Chola incident. On 1 October 1967, some Indian and Chinese soldiers had an argument over the control of a boulder at the Chola outpost in Sikkim (then a protectorate of India), triggering a fight that escalated to a mortar and heavy machine gun duel. * On 10 October, both sides again exchanged heavy fire. While Indian forces would sustain eighty-eight troops killed in action with another 163 troops wounded, China would suffer more casualties, with 300 killed and more than 200 wounded in Nathu La, as well as forty in Chola. China in Jan.1994:- * In January 1994, Beijing announced that it not only favored a negotiated solution on Kashmir, but also opposed any form of independence for the region. * Talks were held in New Delhi in February aimed at confirming established \\"confidence-building measures\\", discussing clarification of the \\"line of actual control\\", reduction of armed forces along the line, and prior information about forthcoming military exercises. 1998 relations:- * Sino-Indian relations hit a low point in 1998 following India's nuclear tests. * Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes declared that \\"‚Äúin my perception of national security, China is enemy No 1.‚Ä¶and any person who is concerned about India‚Äôs security must agree with that fact\\", hinting that India developed nuclear weapons in defence against China's nuclear arsenal. * In 1998, China was one of the strongest international critics of India's nuclear tests and entry into the nuclear club. * During the 1999 Kargil War China voiced support for Pakistan, but also counseled Pakistan to withdraw its forces. 2017 Dokhlam faceoff:- * On 16 June 2017 Chinese troops with construction vehicles and road-building equipment began extending an existing road southward in Doklam, a territory which is claimed by both China as well as India's ally Bhutan. * On 18 June 2017, around 270 Indian troops, with weapon..."},{"instruction":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","output":"you‚Äôll be surprised"},{"instruction":"Learning programming: When is it appropriate to use UDP instead of TCP?","output":"When correctness and completeness are not that important, or when ‚Äúmoving forward‚Äù is more important. (TCP requires that the sender and receiver synchronize their records. UDP doesn‚Äôt, at the cost of possible data loss.) This is useful for streaming data, non-critical telemetry (where data is resent all the time), and for simple protocols implemented in embedded devices with little memory and no time to lose. Note that you need to be careful with UDP behavior and must treat the system in the way that data can be lost anytime. Some control systems are too unsafe to be used with UDP unless serious considerations are taken. For example, if you‚Äôre running a wireless-controlled Mars rover with TCP in a low-latency network, you can use simple GO and STOP commands to control the vehicle movement. However, if you do the same in a high-latency network or using UDP, what would happen if GO command registers, but not STOP? Your rover goes off the cliff or runs over colonists! For UDP implementation, you need something like ‚ÄúFORWARD 5m‚Äù commands instead. It‚Äôs also why ‚Äújust use UDP‚Äù is not the answer.

But let‚Äôs not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it‚Äôs easier to find and read. Let‚Äôs rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield. He shattered that net of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu‚Äôs many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna‚Äôs advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna‚Äôs son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra‚Äôs son destroyed six of Karna‚Äôs advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots. [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #RmcLd]Abhimanyu even defeated Dronacharya, Aswatthama, Brihadbala, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Karna, Kritavarman and Shakuni even though all these people attacked him in a group.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gbgbA] Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back by thy grandson. Abhimanyu was made chariotless. He was deprived of a bow fairly by Karna. He still managed to defeat or overpower Aswatthama with a mace.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #LuVHv] Why does the brave hero get 9th rank and not any higher rank? Abhimanyu faced various defeats in his life which cannot be ignored. He was defeated on 1st day itself by Bhishma, 12th day by Bhagadatta etc. 8). Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma‚Äôs reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it. Such was the power of his immensely powerful and infallible Vaishnavastra that Lord Krishna himself had to save Arjuna.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #Sqzab] There‚Äôs no need to prove that why he is at 8th. There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana‚Äôs chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima‚Äôs vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna‚Äôs prowess that Satyaki couldn‚Äôt defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha‚Äôs boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can‚Äôt recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma‚Äôs exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess‚Äô Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I‚Äôll provide information about all his victories. Don‚Äôt worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else‚Äôs chariot. The word ‚Äòvanquished‚Äô is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima‚Äôs arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‚Äòretreat‚Äô. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‚Äòdevoured‚Äô by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2‚Äì3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima‚Äôs defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima‚Äôs life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn‚Äôt defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha‚Äôs demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna‚Äôs Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama‚Äôs destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5‚Äì6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9‚Äì10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don‚Äôt downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna‚Äôs celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona‚Äôs son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna‚Äôs arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona‚Äôs son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna‚Äôs valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna‚Äôs four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times.

Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could.

The ship is an artifact, created to serve a certain purpose. But as a contingent aggregate of physical things it could be the ‚Äúsame‚Äù while losing its ability to play that role. We take the ship apart and now it‚Äôs a pile of lumber. Suppose the sailors do this to have fire when shipwrecked on an island. The pile of parts is ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as the ship in the sense it‚Äôs the same physical aggregate, the same physical components. But if we regard it as ‚Äúthe same‚Äù while the parts are gradually replaced over time, that tells us a different principle of identity is at play. Presumably one that requires the ability to still serve the role as the original, that is, as a ship. But what if the parts were taken out and used in other ships for some years and then by accident re-assembled into a ship with the same parts in a shipyard years later. Would it be the same ship or a simulation? If we would say it‚Äôs not the same ship, this suggests we‚Äôre using a criterion where causal continuity is at play. To be the same ship then requires continuous existence of a ship aggregate that has continuity as a ship despite replacement of parts. But it‚Äôs still a contingent aggregate, a mere pile of things, that happens to serve a certain function. This is not the same as human identity over time because humans are an organic unity in a way that a ship is not. Humans continually take on new matter through eating and breathing and give off matter through wastes. But a living thing has a certain homeostatic character, functions that work to keep it alive. A human has a nature as a single thing whereas the ship has no nature though its physical components do. The wood in the ship has its physical structure as do the metal parts. But the ship as such has no nature. So human identity over time requires a thing with the same nature that has causal continuity over time. To the extent we think the ship of Theseus requires some continuity as a ship over time to be the same ship, we seem to be using an analogy with living things.

Rapid weight loss methods, such as extreme diets or excessive exercise, can often be detrimental to your overall health and lead to a cycle of yo-yo dieting. Instead, focus on making gradual, long-term changes to your lifestyle that will not only help you shed those extra pounds but also maintain your weight in the future. Here are some effective and safe strategies to help you lose weight in a reasonable time frame: Balanced Diet: Rather than severely restricting your calorie intake, aim for a well-balanced diet that includes lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Portion control is key ‚Äì focus on eating smaller, nutrient-dense meals that keep you satisfied and provide sustained energy. Hydration: Staying properly hydrated is crucial for weight loss. Drinking water before meals can help control your appetite and prevent overeating. Replace sugary beverages with water, herbal teas, or infused water to cut down on unnecessary calories. Regular Exercise: Incorporate a mix of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training into your routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days. Mindful Eating: Pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and savor your meals, which can prevent overeating. Avoid distractions like screens while eating to stay mindful of your food choices. Sleep: Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep deprivation can disrupt hormones related to hunger and appetite, leading to weight gain. A well-rested body is more likely to make healthier food choices and engage in physical activity. Stress Management: Chronic stress can lead to overeating or making poor food choices. Incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy.Consult Professionals: Before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or registered dietitian. They can help create a personalized plan that takes your individual health status and goals into account. Remember, sustainable weight loss is not just about shedding pounds quickly but about developing healthier habits that can be maintained over time. Rapid weight loss methods often lead to muscle loss, nutritional deficiencies, and a higher likelihood of regaining the lost weight. Focus on making gradual changes that promote your overall well-being, and be patient with the process. By embracing a balanced lifestyle, you can achieve your weight loss goals and enjoy improved health in the long run.

Before 1958, the Republic of China(1912 - 1949) was an Agrarian Society. Four out of five Chinese worked in agriculture. But this changed as property rights in the countryside were kept on hold which eventually led to the growth of small nonagricultural businesses in rural areas. It all changed when this guy Mao Zedong, took over as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China(CPC) and founded the People's Republic of China (PRC)(1949 - present). In the year of 1958, Mao started his Second Five Year Plan which was called as the Great Leap Forward whose main objective was the rapid development of China's agricultural and industrial sectors. This led to massive industrialization throughout the country. Since China is a Communist country, it made a ban on private holdings of farmland and started the agricultural collectivization, where the private farms would run as a joint enterprise and all the food produced would be bought by the government so that it can feed the people working in the industries. Communes were setup where everything was shared. Private kitchens became redundant, and everything in the private kitchen, such as tables, chairs, cooking utensils and pans were all contributed to the communes kitchen. Private cooking was banned and replaced by communal dining. Mao also started another campaign which was called as the Four Pests Campaign(1958) in which rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows were to be eliminated. Suddenly, all the hell broke loose when the local commune officials noticed that the stockpiles of food was being consumed rapidly by the people of commune which led the food to get depleted. Higher officials did not dare to report the economic disaster caused by these policies, and national officials, blaming bad weather for the decline in food output. But instead, Mao exaggerated the claims of having ‚Äúsuper abundance‚Äù of food which really didn‚Äôt exist. Due to the Four Pests Campaign, a severe ecological imbalance was created due to which several other pests such as locusts, grasshoppers ,etc. have started to spawn which destroyed the crops. Adding to this, droughts and floods was another blow to the peasants in China. This created a detrimental effect on country side where poor people were starved to death and there were also reported cases of cannibalism. And this led to The Great Chinese Famine, Between 1959 and 1961, the famine took a death toll of over ten million which was then reported as the deadliest famine and the greatest man-made disasters in human history.The failure of the Great Leap Forward as well as the famine led Mao Zedong to withdraw from active decision making and turn many future responsibilities over to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping Eventually, Deng Xiaoping became the next leader of China and launched the historic Reforms and Opening up program which fundamentally changed the agricultural and industrial system in China. Deng's first reforms began in agriculture. By the late 1970s, food supplies and production had become so deficient that government officials were warning that China was about to repeat the \\"disaster of 1959\\". Deng responded by decollectivizing agriculture and emphasizing the household-responsibility system, which divided the land of the People's communes into private plots. During this period, few of the small scale farmers started to consume wildlife animals for their survival. This was backed up by the Chinese government which eventually led to the birth of wildlife farming industry.

The Culture‚Äôs Minds, hyperintelligent AIs who to all intents and purposes run a galactic civilisation, are in the background in the first few novels, but are increasingly front and centre as the series progresses. Excession, Look To Windward and Surface Detail are the novels with the AIs most central to the story, but it‚Äôs worth reading all the books, starting with Consider Phlebas. A mention here also for Ken Macleod, Banks‚Äôs friend and literary executor, whose novels The Star Fraction, The Stone Canal (which are closely related) and The Resurrection Game feature uploaded minds - but to say any more would spoil things. The Night Sessions also features an AI as a major character, an ex-military robot now working for the police with a human partner, who goes by the name of Skulk. Charles Stross looks at post-human ism from several angles. Accelerando explores how we might end up with uploaded consciousnesses; Glasshouse envisages a group of traumatised mercenaries uploading themselves into an experimental therapeutic community; and Saturn‚Äôs Children and Neptune‚Äôs Brood are literally post-human: the characters are all androids that had been created to serve humanity, but who have outlived our long-extinct species. Uploaded human minds are something of a preoccupation for Greg Egan, who has written two novels (and a number of short stories) where uploaded consciousness is front and centre. Zendegi explores how you might go about uploading a consciousness in the first place, Permutation City looks at what it might be like to be part of an uploaded community on an interstellar mission. Short stories such as The Planck Dive are set entirely within uploaded communities, as is his novel Diaspora (for my money his best book). The lead character of Ann Leckie‚Äôs Ancillary series goes in the opposite direction: she is a former spaceship AI stuck in a single human body out of the army of ‚Äúancillaries‚Äù that it used to control."},{"instruction":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","output":"I grew up believing Zig Zags were chewy peppermint pastilles"},{"instruction":"What does the word 'lingam' mean in Sanskrit?","output":"Lingam means a symbol or mark.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","output":"My younger brother got notes sent home almost everyday for not turning in his work. He'd tell our grandmother (she was one of our caregivers, parents were pretty much out of the picture) that he didn't have any homework. But the next day he'd get another note, she'd ask him if he had any homework, he said no, next day he'd get another note. My grandmother got fed up at his blatant lies, she threatened him if one more note she's going to school to talk to the teacher (my brother was in 7th grade). A couple days later, another note, so she went to the school 10 minutes before school let out, and waited by his classroom door to see his teacher as soon as school was over. He was not a happy camper (icing on the cake, our grandmother dressed like an old lady in the 1990s, when this took place, she had the old lady football helmet hair style and she would draw her eyebrows on in a single line in about half an inch from her actual eyebrows. So as a kid/teen it's extremely embarrassing.) Anyways, she met with the teacher with him in the meeting. My brother apparently got called out on his lies (I didn't get to witness this because I was already in highschool.) And he made some contract that he'd always turn in his homework on time and if he had a question he would ask the teacher. Any who, a couple weeks went by, no notes. Then one day another note. My grandmother said no more warnings. She had asked the teacher if she could come and sit in on class to see what's going on if he gets more notes/not turn in homework. So that next day, she took the note and my brother to school, brought a lawn chair and her crochet supplies and a bagged lunch. She went to the classroom, sat up her chair and supplies in the back of the classroom. She stayed there all day. She found out that my brother would sit in class and stare at his teacher during lessons. Come to find out, my brother had a crush on his very nice looking teacher (she was very pretty, model pretty). So he honestly didn't even remember getting assigned homework, he couldn't admit that without admitting the crush. My brother never got a note sent home again for the rest of his school career. His grades went from D's and F's to C's and a few B's. I can still remember how I felt as a kid/teen, if my grandmother would have come sit in on my class, it might had lead to death by embarrassment. I would have done anything for it to never happen again. Luckily I never got a note sent home, thank goodness (I was afraid to get in trouble). As a kid/teen I'd say, no don't do that to your kid. But as an adult, clearly what's going on now isn't working, so desperate times call for desperate measures. And if it doesn't work the first time. Next time dress up in the tackiest possible way and show up to sit in‚Ä¶lol. On the other hand, maybe you going to sit in you might see an issue that isn't your son's fault at all. Or maybe he just needs more help than the teacher can't give without taking from the rest of the class and you could hire your son a tutor. Whatever you choose to do, good luck and I hope things improve in school for your son."},{"instruction":"w do I dance the Tango?","output":"Ah, it is a bit too complicated to describe on Quora, BUT, you can figure out what style you want to learn before going in for lessons.

However, there are several news organizations in the United States that strive to maintain a reputation for impartiality and objective reporting. Here are a few well-regarded sources that are generally considered to be relatively neutral and nonpartisan: Reuters: Known for its commitment to factual reporting and avoiding sensationalism, Reuters is a global news agency that provides coverage on a wide range of topics with a focus on accuracy and impartiality.Associated Press (AP): As a nonprofit news organization, the AP aims to provide unbiased reporting and is widely used as a primary source of news by many media outlets. They follow strict guidelines to ensure objectivity in their reporting.BBC News: Although based in the United Kingdom, the BBC offers comprehensive coverage of global events, including news from the United States. It is known for its rigorous reporting standards and commitment to impartiality.The Wall Street Journal: While some critics argue that The Wall Street Journal has a slight conservative-leaning editorial page, its news reporting is generally regarded as reliable and unbiased, especially in economic and business matters.The New York Times: The New York Times is a reputable newspaper that covers a wide range of topics. While it has faced criticism for potential bias on certain issues, it still maintains a commitment to accurate reporting and includes diverse perspectives in its coverage. It's important to note that even with these sources, it is always recommended to critically evaluate the information presented and cross-reference multiple news outlets to gain a more comprehensive understanding of any given topic. Additionally, biases can still exist within individual articles or specific journalists, so maintaining a media diet that includes multiple perspectives is essential for a well-rounded understanding of the news.

For me I never realized that stretching would really affect my running, I wasn‚Äôt a sprinter. For years I had patellar tendinitis (I had been working out and running for over 10 years at that point) and tried everything to get rid of it. I saw doctors, went to sport medicine; I even stopped running for 3 years! When I started running again the patella tendinitis was gone! Problem solved, or so I thought. After about 3 months it came back. I thought it was something that was a fact of life with running for me. One evening I was thinking about the body and over use injuries. I was thinking how working out one muscle group over time causes muscle imbalances which leads to many injuries (it‚Äôs why cross training is important). I then was thinking about how my knee is designed and that my quad could be tight which is creating the problem in the tendons in my knee. I started stretching religiously after every single run making sure that I hit all the major muscle groups especially my quads. It took about six months But The patellar tendinitis went away. I started to develop this weird high calf issue and found this stretch that hurt like crazy but as soon as I‚Äôd do it the calf issue would subside. It‚Äôs been 6 months now and it‚Äôs 98% gone. I‚Äôm still slightly thought on my right side but I get at it after every run. Please do do not overlook cross training (and stretching) as it will help from developing muscle imbalances. You can run (or lift weights) for years and years and never see any problem/s and one day out of the blue something pops up. It‚Äôs super hard to diagnose. Once signs start appearing it can take years to correct and fix the problem and it can suck the joy out of running. lift weights, take other exercise classes, yoga is great. Plus they add some spice to hitting the pavement day after day."},{"instruction":"What are the similarities between the Hindu Brahmin religion and the Abrahamic religions besides the stories of Abram & Sarai and Bramha & Saraswathi? The Jews claim to be descendants of Abram. The Brahmins of India say they came from Bramha.","output":"Brahmin is a Varna, like Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. And varna is the manner in which each of us seeks divine perfection. For example, the Brahmin seek the divine through knowledge, the kshatriya through leadership as a service, the vaishya through enterpreneurship as a service and the shudra through their individual talents and abilities. There is no ‚ÄúBrahmin religion‚Äù. The Jews were Pagan/Hindu, possibly an early Shaiva tradition as Nandi was a Pagan Jewish icon, before they fell away from the dharmic path and went Abrahamic. It is possible they fell away from the dharmic path thousands of years before they went Abrahamic as much of those who migrated out of the Sindhu-Saraswati Asura kingdoms did in having to adapt to very new realities. But this is a subject matter for future research. Brahma on the other hand is an ‚Äúaspect‚Äù of the ‚Äúultimate reality‚Äù or ‚Äútruth‚Äù, in Hindu philosophy, not a God. There are no Gods in any Hindu tradition. This is much like Vishnu and Shiva are aspects of the ‚Äútruth‚Äù, one that anyone can validate through simple observation and inference. And while Brahma represents the function of creation as well as knowledge, Vishnu represents preservation of dharma (the eternal essence of the universe) and Shiva the maintenance of the cycles of the universe (material cycles, and time). The symbology used in representations should be adequate to inform you the true nature of these aspects. They also represent ‚Äúdharmic paths‚Äù, as elucidated in the shruti, the smriti/puran and the itihasa texts. Therefore Brahmins cannot possibly have descended from Brahma, an entirely abstract philosophical aspect of divine reality. But since Brahmins or intellectuals seek divine perfection through ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù, Brahma is their ‚Äúideal of divine or perfect knowledge‚Äù, and the Veda represents their ‚Äúdharmic path‚Äù to Brahma Vidya."},{"instruction":"Why do so many students in India study engineering?

And both buildings DID take the hit, and didn't collapse ‚Äî not initially. But the engineers overlooked something simple, but also critical. The fire insulation material that protected the steel infrastructure of the buildings was BLOWN OFF, when each plane hit that building. Without that fire insulation material there to protect the steel from the intense heat of all that jet fuel, now there existed a scenario that the engineers did not account for. The fire from thousands of gallons of jet fuel heated and weakened the steel. Not melted the steel, just weakened it. With that weakened steel, the skeleton of each building was no longer able to support the weight of the floors above. Then as each floor collapsed, the stress on each floor below was unable to bear that weight. Think of it like this ‚Äî we have trucks that can support the weight of a car, right? You see flatbed tow trucks carry cars around your city every day. But what would happen if you DROPPED a car on to a flatbed tow truck from a height of 20+ feet? Would the tow truck take the weight and be undamaged? No, of course not. That's why each floor of each WTC building could not bear the weight. Once one floor in the middle collapsed, each building was doomed to fall. What is the lesson from all of this? That it isn't practical to design buildings THAT TALL, that can withstand a direct hit from a LARGE commercial airplane. Did Osama Bin Laden KNOW all of that, when he planned the whole thing? He didn't have to know. Even if both WTC buildings had remained standing, the desired TERRORIST goal would have been accomplished. The fact that the buildings fell was just a bonus for the TERRORISTS who comitted this horrific attack."},{"instruction":"dry sift kief higher quality than bubble hash?","output":"All other factors being equal there is no difference. ‚ÄúBubble hash‚Äù must be dried before using.

However, here are some general guidelines that may help you: Consider your audience's time zone: If your target audience is mainly located in a specific time zone, consider scheduling your video to upload during their local daytime hours, when they are more likely to be active on Facebook.Avoid uploading during peak hours: Facebook tends to have higher levels of activity during peak hours, which can make it harder for your content to stand out. Avoid uploading your video during these times, such as during the morning or evening rush hour.Test different times: Try uploading your videos at different times of the day or week and track the engagement rates to determine which times work best for your specific audience and content.Consider your content: If your video content is time-sensitive or related to a specific event or holiday, consider uploading it in the days leading up to or during that event for maximum engagement. Overall, it's important to experiment with different upload times and monitor the performance of your videos to determine what works best for your audience and content."},{"instruction":"What do hotels do with used soap?","output":"I believe they dispose of it."},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"In our scriptures it is said that what people will say that will become shashtra in kaliyug.

However, there are several factors that have been identified as potential contributors to unhappiness or dissatisfaction among certain individuals or groups within a generation. Here are a few possible reasons why some people in our generation may feel unhappy: High expectations: Our generation has grown up in a time of rapid technological advancements, societal changes, and increasing globalization. With these changes come higher expectations and pressure to succeed in various aspects of life, such as education, career, and personal achievements. Striving to meet these high expectations can lead to stress and dissatisfaction when goals are not met. Economic challenges: Many individuals in our generation have faced economic challenges, such as student loan debt, limited job opportunities, and rising living costs. These financial pressures can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of insecurity about the future, which can contribute to unhappiness. Social media and comparison: Social media has become an integral part of our lives, allowing us to connect with others and share experiences. However, it can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness when we constantly compare ourselves to others' carefully curated highlight reels. This constant exposure to others' seemingly perfect lives can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of dissatisfaction with our own lives. Mental health issues: There has been an increasing recognition of mental health issues in recent years, and our generation has been more open about discussing and seeking help for these issues. Factors such as stress, pressure, and societal changes may contribute to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions, which can impact overall happiness and well-being. Disconnect from nature and community: In an increasingly digitized world, our generation may spend more time indoors, isolated from nature and face-to-face social interactions. Lack of connection with nature and a sense of community can lead to feelings of disconnection, loneliness, and unhappiness. It's important to remember that while these factors may contribute to unhappiness for some individuals, they do not apply to everyone in our generation. Each person's experience is unique, and it's essential to consider a range of factors when discussing happiness and well-being. Additionally, societal changes and generational experiences vary across different regions and cultures, so it's important to avoid making overly broad generalizations."},{"instruction":"want to start a diet but I can never go by the diet.

In 1996, at 41 years of age, I was trying to learn Spanish, but because I was working, there was no time to go to formal classes. A friend of mine introduced me to the music of a Mexican rock group called, ‚ÄúMAN√Å ‚Äù (translation: ‚Äúmanna‚Äù ‚Äî like the food that was sent down from Heaven). They were easy to listen to AND luckily, the lyrics were included with the audio cassette or CD (no YouTube in those days). MY STEPS TO FLUENCY (THIS TOOK ME LESS THAN TWO YEARS TO DO, even though I was still working full-time): 1. LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, WHILE READING THE LYRICS TO THE SONGS. Their songs are on YouTube, complete with lyrics, but if you still like CD‚Äôs, make sure you get the original CD releases, (not the ‚ÄúGreatest Hits of‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúGrandes √âxitos‚Äù, ‚Äú20 Kilates‚Äù, etc.) ‚Äî because it is more likely that the lyrics will be inside. If they‚Äôre not included, you can either look them up on a lyrics site (lyrics = letras, in Spanish), or use YouTube. I recommend listening each CD, one song at a time and several times over, to hear each word and process it, but at this point‚Ä¶DO NOT WORRY THAT YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT ALL OF THE WORDS MEAN! What you‚Äôre doing now, is learning ‚Äúphonics‚Äù, or how written words are supposed to sound. Listen to each album, several times through, to familiarize yourself with proper word order, and how each word is pronounced. Pay attention to accentuation and the stress put on the words by the singers (cantantes). 2. NOW, SHUT OFF THE MUSIC ‚Äî AND WRITE OUT THE LYRICS ON A COLLEGE-RULED PIECE OF PAPER, LEAVING ONE SPACE BETWEEN EACH LINE OF LYRICS. Then, in-between the lines of lyrics, by using on-line dictionaries, WRITE OUT THE LYRICS IN ENGLISH. The idea is to begin to leave English behind, but you‚Äôll need to use it as a crutch, at least for now. 3. LISTEN TO THE SONGS AGAIN, ONLY THIS TIME YOU‚ÄôLL KNOW WHAT THE SONG IS ABOUT, BECAUSE, NOW, YOU‚ÄôLL UNDERSTAND THE WORDS AND WHAT EACH SONG IS ABOUT. 4. LASTLY, SING THE SONGS, ALONG WITH THE MUSIC, AND TRY TO COPY THE SINGER‚ÄôS ACCENT & PRONUNCIATION AS CLOSELY AS YOU CAN. You‚Äôll soon discover that you‚Äôre starting to remember the lyrics, word-for-word. Since the person who wrote the lyrics has correctly conjugated the verbs in them, memorizing conjugations is unnecessary ‚Äî that part has already been done for you ‚Äì just look up the conjugated verbs in a Spanish dictionary or on the internet, and the infinitive form of the verb and its definition will appear in the entry. (Example: ‚Äúcomi√≥‚Äù ‚Äì preterit: means you/he/she/ or it ate; from ‚ÄúCOMER‚Äù ‚Äì infinitive: TO EAT.) 5. AFTER YOU FINISH ONE ALBUM, GO ON TO ANOTHER ONE. YOU‚ÄôLL QUICKLY NOTICE THAT COMMON KEY PHRASES AND CONSTRUCTIONS, THAT YOU NOW ALREADY KNOW THE MEANINGS OF, HAVE BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE LYRICS OF THE NEW SONGS. 6. AS YOU MOVE FROM ALBUM TO ALBUM, YOUR VOCABULARY WILL START TO GROW. Other groups that I used include: Enrique Iglesias, Lucero, Patricia Manterola, Shakira, Gloria Estefan, Fey, Ricky Martin, Sentidos Opuestos, Ricardo Arjona, Ricardo Montaner, Chayanne, among many others. After your vocabulary has grown somewhat‚Ä¶ 7. START WATCHING‚Ä¶A SOAP OPERA ‚Äî THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT, A SOAP OPERA (UNA TELENOVELA)! They are cheesy, contrived stories, but IMHO, they are absolutely the best medium to quickly gain an understanding of how things are really said in the Spanish-speaking world. Benefits: There is a story, a scene (like a doctor‚Äôs office, for example), professional actors, and clearly-enunciated dialogue. Usually, the actors will speak their ‚Äúlines‚Äù, taking turns while listening for a ‚Äúcue-word‚Äù, so they know when to say their lines. This is unlike in real life, in which people talk over each other, interrupting them. I would follow one SOAP OPERA, from beginning to end ‚Äì each one lasts 2 months, or so; then a new one is started, unlike U.S. soaps which seemingly continue forever. I suggest recording each episode, later to be replayed ‚Äî scene-by-scene ‚Äî WITH SUBTITLES IN SPANISH! This was the gauge by which I measured my progress, by estimating the percentage of words I knew, versus those I still didn‚Äôt understand, or couldn‚Äôt even make out when spoken. You can also watch movies that have been dubbed into Spanish, along with the subtitles in Spanish, however I discovered that the words don‚Äôt always match up as well as they do in the soaps (this would be because different companies do the dubbing and subtitling, I imagine.) 8. I bought a SPANISH-ONLY DICTIONARY FOR CHILDREN off the internet, which was used to ‚Äúwean‚Äù me off of the English-Spanish translating dictionary that I had been using. I STARTED LOOKING UP UNFAMILIAR WORDS, as I watched the soap operas. The dictionary I found, listed each word‚Äôs part of speech, whether it was masculine or feminine, listed all of the definitions for them and even had an example of a sentence, in which it was used in proper context. 9. As your vocabulary grows, along with your self-confidence, START SPEAKING IN SPANISH with anyone and everyone you can ‚Äî to the maximum level of your ability. They never made fun of the way in which I was speaking ‚Äì in fact, I found all Spanish-speakers to be gracious, understanding and extremely helpful in learning their language.

At that point, we were in a severe recession and the federal government was suffering from reduced tax receipts. That law doubled most federal taxes and worsened a pre-existing economic downturn that we now know as the Great Depression. To make matters worse, the economy was so damaged by this tax hike that the federal government didn‚Äôt even get the revenue it thought it would get. The Great Depression created the conditions that made Hitler and Japanese aggression possible. It horribly marred domestic politics in the United States and has left us with a huge and unaccountable federal government. The GOP has never recovered from the drubbing it took in the 1932 election and is consciously not representing the people who vote Republican. It made all of the horrors of World War 2 come true and lead to the Cold War. I would veto the 1932 federal tax act and then plan on Herbert Hoover still losing the 1932 election. It just would not have been nearly as bad, and hopefully FDR would have a lot less clout to enact counter-productive legislation and the country would recover from the economic crisis more quickly. I would also want Zachary Taylor to live out his term as U.S. President. Taylor was a unionist and against the Compromise of 1850. He was a very successful general and talked of raising an army and putting down threatened rebellion. He was also a slaveholder.

CAVEAT: You are comparing a Cluster B disorder, NPD‚Ä¶a dramatic, erratic disorder‚Ä¶with a Cluster C disorder, OCPD‚Ä¶an anxious, fearful disorder. Let me break it down visually so it‚Äôs clear‚Ä¶ NPD=pursuit of admiration from others (as being worthy)OCPD=avoidance of punishment by others (for making a mistake) NOTE: Individuals with NPD are seeking something outside themselves, while individuals with OCPD are avoiding something others might do to them. HINT: Both individuals with NPD and OCPD behavior is related to external forces they try to manipulate in their favor. NPD behavior (and thinking) is driven to acquire the admiration of others, in order to prop up the individual‚Äôs delusion of grandiosity (which is a defense mechanism developed in early childhood to protect the child‚Äôs mind from the terror of feeling worthless due to the way their primary caregivers treated them). WARNING: The DSM fails to mention Closet/Covert Narcissism and the behaviors that go along with that form of NPD (which appears as quiet, submissive, and slightly aloof), as well as Malignant Narcissism, and the highly sociopathic and psychologically, emotionally, and sexually abusive and sadistic behaviors those individuals engage in. OCPD behavior (and thinking) is driven by fear and anxiety to avoid punishment from others (which are defense mechanisms developed in early childhood to protect the child from being punished by authoritarian parenting that was harsh when mistakes were made and failed to reward almost anything good the child did). THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT REASONS FOR BEHAVING AND THINKING THEY WAY THEY DO, both caused by very poor parenting in early childhood. EXPLANATION: Personality disorders can be thought of as a cluster of character and behavioral traits that are known to be detrimental to the individual with them, as well as harmful (and sometimes abusive) to others, and which are considered to be outside the normative and healthy range. That is an oversimplification, but it may help to think of them in that manner for the purpose of general understanding. There are 10 Personality Disorders. If interested, you can find all 10 here [LINKED_TEXT: Different Types] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/types-of-personality-disorders/]. Before you compare and contrast NPD with OCPD, it might also help you to read about the 100 common behaviors and traits and that all 10 Personality Disorders share. If interested, you can find those 100 common behaviors and traits here [LINKED_TEXT: Top 100 Traits & Behaviors] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/traits/]. Once you have a rudimentary understanding of the 100 common behaviors and traits that ALL 10 personality disorders are known to share, you can then compare and contrast those the DSM recognizes as inherent in NPD [LINKED_TEXT: Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/personality-disorders-1/2015/12/6/narcissistic-personality-disorder-npd] and those the DSM recognizes as inherent in OCPD [LINKED_TEXT: Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/personality-disorders-1/2015/12/6/obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder-ocpd] Now that you have some resources you can use to understand and learn about those two particular personality disorders, as the DSM define thems. you may be able to make a better assessment of the individuals you‚Äôre inquiring about. I hope this helps get you started on your own path to learning and discovery.

In fact, many people find it beneficial for their skin. Aloe vera has soothing, hydrating, and moisturizing properties that can help calm irritated skin, provide hydration, and promote skin healing. When using aloe vera gel on your face overnight, here are a few tips to keep in mind: 1. Choose pure aloe vera gel: Look for aloe vera gel that is pure and free from additives or additional ingredients that may irritate your skin. You can also extract the gel directly from an aloe vera plant if you have one. 2. Patch test: If you are using a new brand or product, it's always a good idea to perform a patch test first. Apply a small amount of aloe vera gel to a small area of your skin, such as the inner forearm, and leave it on overnight. If you don't experience any adverse reactions or irritation, it should be safe to use on your face. 3. Cleanse your face: Before applying aloe vera gel, ensure that your face is clean and free from makeup, dirt, or other skincare products. Gently cleanse your face and pat it dry before applying the gel. 4. Apply a thin layer: A little goes a long way with aloe vera gel. Apply a thin, even layer to your face and gently massage it in until absorbed. Allow it to dry before going to bed. 5. Pillowcase protection: Consider using an old pillowcase or placing a towel over your pillow to protect it from any potential residue or staining from the aloe vera gel. 6. Rinse off in the morning: In the morning, you can rinse your face with water or follow your regular skincare routine. However, if the gel has fully absorbed and does not feel sticky or uncomfortable, you can choose to leave it on. It's important to note that while aloe vera gel is generally well-tolerated, some individuals may have allergies or sensitivities to it. If you experience any irritation, redness, or discomfort after applying aloe vera gel, discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional. Additionally, if you have any specific skin concerns or conditions, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and recommendations."},{"instruction":"Where can I find a loan shark fast?","output":"I need to find one?

Rather ironically in the Ukrainian War it is the Russian Federation that is suffering from ‚ÄúSalami Tactics‚Äù.The slow escalation of what is being supplied to Ukraine and Ukrainian actions means that none of these actions are worthy of a nuclear response. The problem with the Nuclear M.A.D. policy is that it renders nuclear weapons moot in an armed conflict. No-one wants to perform an act that is likely to kill themselves and destroy their own nation. Putin‚Äôs Government is intent on capturing territory for practical purposes - using a nuclear weapon on that territory would render that territory worthless, or at least very costly. It also communicates the message that the Russian Federation is weak. However, in a sense, you are right we have been inching closer to a nuclear war. And that is entirely down to Putin‚Äôs decision making. Invading another sovereign nation after making many, many guarantees was a huge risk. Indeed under some of the agreements that Russia has made - these could have been used as a casus belli by the United States and United Kingdom. Furthermore allowing Russian state media to broadcast repeated threats that they‚Äôre going to use nuclear weapons against other nuclear powers is highly provocative.

Restaurants that serve butter do so because their customers want it and, usually, because they‚Äôre more upscale. I suspect that most people with the money to choose use butter and expect it in restaurants. Secondly, your premise is that margarine is healthier, presumably because it‚Äôs lower in saturated fats; but, they‚Äôre higher in trans fats, due to the hydrogenation process. According to [LINKED_TEXT: Harvard] [URL: https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good], the risk of heart disease rises by 23% for every 2% of calories from trans fat consumed daily. Based on the nutrition facts spotlighted on Google, when I looked up margarine and butter, margarine has 2.1 grams of trans fat per tablespoon, whereas butter only has .5 grams. Fat isn‚Äôt inherently bad for us. Animal-based saturated fats aren‚Äôt great; but, biologically-speaking, we‚Äôre animals. We need some amount of saturated fat in our diets and, if a tablespoon of butter, here and there, tips you past your healthy limit, you need to look at your overall diet. I‚Äôm going to assume, statistically-speaking, that you still drink milk and/or eat cheese/cheese-based products, ice cream, whipped cream, etc., at least sometimes. Butter is literally 1 step past whipped cream. It‚Äôs the cream, taken off the top of fresh milk, and beaten in a blender until the buttermilk separates out and the rest thickens into butter. Then, it can be salted or not and rolled into a log or square mold to set. Edit: There are margarines, like Country Crock, that are healthy in that they are not hydrogenated. However, knowing what brand of margarine the restaurant uses is another matter, and real butter is still healthier b/c it has only 2 ingredients‚Äîcream and salt."},{"instruction":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","output":"This is one of the more legit websites that actually pays you decently for completing surveys etc. online.

Out of of these three factors we can control first two factors fully and we have very less or at all no control on third factor. One should be in perfect physical and mental condition while driving. He/she must be familiar with good driving techniques. He/she should have enough experience of driving under a very good guidance. He/she must not drink any amount of alcohol.

Russia is a super power militarily despite its humiliations based on size, capacity and nuclear weapons. It was a political superpower in terms of leading a larger state (USSR) that in turn led a world block and represented an ideology, communism. That is all gone and no individual could restore it. It still is powerful by virtue of its military strength and by being a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN. Russia has never been a superpower in economic terms and is weaker now relatively than it has been in the past. Culturally Russia is a superpower if you consider its cultural influence and achievement. Of course there are so many other countries of that status today or in the past including Ireland, Italy, France, Iran, China, India, Germany, Japan, Greece, Spain, United States‚Ä¶ These are all countries with massive cultural achievement and influence on others now or in the past. In terms of knowledge Russia has been a leader and even a super power in a number of areas of science and technology. I am in no position to say if it retains any of that now. Ethical, democratic and moral super powers are harder to define as it really depends on your beliefs as to which country could be a super power in that area. Some countries are recognized for their influence on ethical and moral values above their status otherwise in the world. Many countries are influential in some areas and not others. South Africa is a good example of being a leader in certain areas (like African leadership in LGBT) while being open to criticism in others. Richer countries also find it easier to occupy what appears to be the high ground despite the fact that exploitation is what got them there.

Stocks represent ownership in companies, and their value can increase over time as the company grows and profits. 2. **Bonds:** Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. They pay interest over a fixed period and return the principal amount at maturity. Bonds are generally considered lower-risk investments compared to stocks. 3. **Mutual Funds:** Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They are managed by professionals and offer diversification for investors with varying risk profiles. 4. **Real Estate:** Real estate investments can include purchasing property, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or real estate crowdfunding platforms. Real estate can provide rental income and the potential for property value appreciation. 5. **Retirement Accounts:** Contributing to retirement accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA offers tax advantages and helps you build wealth for your retirement years. 6. **Index Funds:** Index funds are a type of mutual fund or ETF that aims to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer diversification and typically have lower fees compared to actively managed funds. 7. **Dividend Stocks:** Investing in dividend-paying stocks can provide a source of regular income. Dividends are typically paid out by established and financially stable companies. 8. **Peer-to-Peer Lending:** Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to lend money to individuals or small businesses in exchange for interest payments. This can provide an alternative income stream. 9. **Cryptocurrencies:** Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer the potential for high returns but also come with higher risk due to volatility and regulatory uncertainties. 10. **Education:** Investing in yourself through education, certifications, or skill-building can lead to increased earning potential and career opportunities. 11. **Start a Business:** Entrepreneurship can be a way to invest your money and time into building a business that could generate profits and value in the long term. 12. **Precious Metals:** Investments in precious metals like gold and silver can act as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. When considering investment options, it's important to: - **Set Clear Goals:** Define your investment objectives, whether they are long-term growth, generating income, or capital preservation. - **Diversify:** Spreading your investments across different asset classes helps manage risk. - **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Consider how comfortable you are with potential fluctuations in your investments' value. - **Educate Yourself:** Understand the investment options available and how they work. - **Seek Professional Advice:** Consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Remember that all investments carry some level of risk, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.

The first thing you might notice is that many of them keep their socials locked up and private. Many of them also have fewer friends and followers than average. The reason for this is because they routinely hurt and discard their significant others and leave a line of angry exes in their wake. They don‚Äôt want to risk these former lovers revealing them and posting telling recollections of their relationship and all of the awful things the narcissist has said and done, so they are very careful about who they allow access. It is all about maintaining their image and reputation. So if you find yourself blocked or outside of their socials, it is because the narcissist is trying to keep you quiet. They also disassociate and detach very easily, so by blocking/unfriending/removing you from their socials, they are essentially demoting you and sending you a message that they have detached. If that sounds like something an angry teenager would do, you are spot on. The narcissist will use social media to spy (Hoover) on your accounts if you leave them unblocked. I highly recommend you block them for your own sanity and safety, by the way, but if you do NOT block them, here is what they will do‚Ä¶The narcissist will watch you like a cat watches a squirrel through a window. They see you as their prey and track your every movement - they pay attention to your geotags so they know where to show up with their new SO to make you jealous. They gauge your emotions by the content you post - sad songs, ‚Äúvaguebook‚Äù secret messages just for them, testimonials of your heartbreak, images of you - how you look, happy/sad/dejected, and most importantly, who you are with. They do this to see how vulnerable you are and how much real estate the narcissist is taking up in your mind. The sadder your posts, the more superior and smug the narcissist will feel. He doesn‚Äôt give a care in the world how much he has hurt you - the more you suffer, the more important he feels. Now that you know this, it‚Äôs time to clean up your socials, and please for the love of god, block this scum already if you haven‚Äôt!! But keep in mind that some of them will use fake ‚Äúspy‚Äù accounts, so always be careful how much info and what you put on there. Lastly, the narcissist loves to play social media cat and mouse with you. They will block and unblock ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù to check in on you and see if you are still broken and miserable without them. But they also do it to emotionally torture you, as if you say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here but you can‚Äôt have me, nah nah nah nah nah‚Äù, again, acting like an immature child. They also do this to bait you into contacting them first so they can either slither back into your life temporarily to get something from you (supply: sex, money, attention, etc.) or so they can torment and reject you. This form of narcissistic behavior is so common that I am surprised that more people aren‚Äôt talking about it. They want to manipulate you into thinking they are still around but out of reach, that they still care for you but for whatever reason they won‚Äôt engage with you, they may also want to use you to triangulate their new squeeze to drive her nuts and pin her against you for their own satisfaction. The worst thing you can do is engage with them on social media after he has unblocked and set the trap. By reaching out to him, you give him ALL of the power and satisfaction. He WANTS to matter - he wants to feel wanted - and he wants nothing more than to make you feel rejected, unwanted, miserable, and inferior. Do NOT lower yourself to him and give into his childish manipulations. The best thing you can possibly do is BLOCK him on everything imaginable and grant him absolutely ZERO access to you. This serves to protect you physically and mentally as they will surely use anything and everything against you to make you look as bad as possible so he can smear you and use screenshots to show everyone how crazy YOU are. Not only should you block them, but you should also tighten up your image in case he does use a bogus persona to spy on you. Use your hottest, happiest, most attractive profile picture you‚Äôve got. Make your cover photo a panorama of an outing with your friends, with a big ass carefree smile on your face. Show that piece of garbage that not only are you living your best life WITHOUT him, but you are also not waiting on the sidelines for his attention or return. Show him exactly what he has lost and what you have gained by putting your best foot forward and removing him from your (cyber) life."},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"This kind of disinformation is spread by communists .

The first benchmark test scores from a production iPhone 11 Pro were just discovered online, and they absolutely obliterate every single Android flagship phone on the market. Of all the things we‚Äôve learned about Apple‚Äôs next-generation iPhones over the past few days, this might actually be the least surprising. Apple‚Äôs iPhones get new A-series chipsets each year that offer significant performance gains, and the same can be said of the A13 Bionic chip that powers 2019‚Äôs iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Since there are no Android smartphones on the market right now that are even as powerful as Apple‚Äôs year-old iPhone XS, it certainly stands to reason that the new iPhone 11 Pro would outscore top Android flagships as well. Assumptions are one thing, but seeing actual benchmark scores is another. Now that iPhone 11-series review units are in the hands of early reviews from newspapers and blogs, benchmark test scores are beginning to pop up.

How did the new A13 Bionic-powered iPhone 11 Pro do? See for yourself: Last year‚Äôs iPhone XR achieved single-core scores in the 4700-4800 range, and the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max topped 5,000. As for multi-core scores, all three models reached the mid-11000s. This year‚Äôs iPhone 11 Pro shows modest gains with its single-core score of 5472, but the multi-core score of 13769 is off the charts. To put all this in perspective as it compares to the most powerful Android flagship phones out there right now, [LINKED_TEXT: the best Samsung‚Äôs brand new Galaxy Note 10+ can manage] [URL: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14601294] in the same Geekbench test is a single-core score of 3404 and a multi-core score of 10777. In other words, it‚Äôs not even close. No Android smartphone in 2019 will even come close to matching the new iPhone 11 series, and that should be fairly obvious at this point.

This is not the main argument here. The point is that the PM is entitled to the freedom of practicing his religion and is not answerable to anyone regarding this. A secular country is one which is not biased towards any religion. I believe that any Indian including the PM cannot be expected to refrain from practicing his/her religion in a peaceful manner. And what makes you think that the PM is celebrating certain festivals at the expense of taxpayers‚Äô money ? Every government servant lives on the taxpayers‚Äô expense. You cannot question every person‚Äôs day to day activities which include the celebration of festivals. The secular pillars of our nation shake when we daringly reserve seats on the basis of caste. We should question secularism when elections beacome nothing but caste calculus. And the worst part is that these are not yet alarming issues that we talk about maybe because half of the population is benefiting from these. We instead choose to question the PM‚Äôs statement of being a proud Hindu or rejecting a muslim skull-cap and now on his celebrating Diwali.

That employee is actually watching out for your company‚Äôs best interests. Question: How would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman? Note the emphasis in the question. I would ask the employee if they will not do so because of what he was taught in his religion, or if he is concerned about potential unfounded accusations due to the #metoo movement. If the answer to either question is yes, I would realize that there might be an issue of ‚ÄúFreedom of Religion‚Äù or ‚ÄúFreedom of Suspicion‚Äù at work here. Since the #metoo movement might be an easier solution, I‚Äôll mention it first: #ME TOO? Yes, it is unfortunate that there are accusations being made regarding inappropriate male-female contact. You might want to make it a company policy that there will be no two-people meetings, male-male, female-female, or male-female in any location with the doors closed; or any two-person meal meetings. It‚Äôs so easy to be sure you have a witness for anything that might be accused. It might even be worth asking the participants to keep audio-recordings of those meetings (with permission of all participants) to be sent to Human Resources for archival. Freedom of Religion? I would see if reasonable accommodations could be made. For example, would the employee meet with a female peer when another man and another woman were present at that meeting? He and the woman could do all of the important communication, but the others would keep things on the up and up. If the employee refuses that accommodation, I would ask for a meeting with his pastor, the pastor‚Äôs wife, you, the employee, the employee‚Äôs wife, and the director of Human Resources to see if the group can make an accommodation that the pastor and the pastor‚Äôs wife. If the employee refuses to allow such a meeting to take place, I would assume that the real reason for his refusal is a non-desire to actually do his own work, and I‚Äôd suggest that since he has provided no evidence for his religious objections to doing his work that he either do the work or resign."},{"instruction":"it okay as a beginner guitar player to skip chord F?","output":"That depends on your definition of both ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù and ‚Äúskip‚Äù.

If conversion from Hinduism to other religion is hating Hinduism then agents of other religion too lured him to convert to there religion and he didn't choose one.

However, we get angry when people comes to live here and refuses to learn Catalan/Basque and starts complaining about us being rude and about our culture. That said, as a tourist you can speak in whatever language you want, altough, if they know your language, if you use Spanish they will likely prefer to reply in your own language that in Spanish. A French guy asked my something in Spanish and I replied to him in French. He seemed surprised but at the same time amused. Also, the opinion that we may have about you depends a lot of how you behave, if you ask us something in Spanish politely or you tell us politely that you don't speak Catalan and that if we could speak in Spanish with you, we'll be all fine with you.

They are very genuine and unmistakably unique. They aren‚Äôt Alpha, so they don‚Äôt feel a need to be the center of attention or be the leader of the pack. They will go with the flow if they are comfortable but will not follow if they are not. They have one or two close friends and are not very comfortable in crowds. They are introverted but do attract people to themselves. If a person is pretending to be an INFJ their actions will contradict any of these attributes. The key to spotting any person pretending to be something they aren‚Äôt is to see if actions match or sync with what they are saying especially with INFJs . They are usually pretty honest and have a tough time lying. They do have secrets like anyone else but try to avoid talking about them. hope this helps you."},{"instruction":"it worth buying a (new) Herman Miller Aeron chair? Is there a better (meaning cheaper but ergonomically excellent) chair to buy for my home office?","output":"The Herman Miller Aeron chair is considered one of the best ergonomic office chairs out there. It has a range of adjustable features and a design that provides great support, which can help you avoid back pain and other problems that can come with sitting for long periods. Whether or not it's worth buying a new Aeron chair really depends on what you need and how much you're willing to spend. They're generally pretty expensive, with prices ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 depending on which model and features you choose. However, if you're someone who spends a lot of time sitting at a desk and you want a chair that's going to give you long-term comfort and support, the Aeron might be a good choice. Of course, there are other ergonomic chairs out there that are cheaper than the Aeron. Some good options to consider include the Steelcase Leap, which is usually a bit cheaper than the Aeron, and the Humanscale Diffrient World and HON Exposure, which are both more affordable options. Ultimately, the best chair for your home office is going to depend on what you need, what you like, and how much you want to spend. You might want to try out a few different chairs in person, or read some reviews to see which one sounds like it would work best for you.

It was new to me. But I , did too much partying needed to get away went back to NY where my friends where not Touring Musicians. More Business people weekend warrior types. I only went out weekdays lol. then to Utah. Weird MAN !!!!! Hated it ! was a bit extreme but had great work there. Had most ever.

I could go on a few more places ‚Ä¶.let‚Äôs see Miami Beach o and the worst brief move was Las Vegas. Shit Hole ! And finally Maui the time I sold my business and was dead set on it being for good. Nope.l when I first arrived I felt like I was supposed to be there my whole life. Paradise loved it. Wellllllll fast forward a year and was disenchanted. Things don‚Äôt move.

Yea it‚Äôs the best everyone should leave California it sucks here ? I taking a walk on the beach tomorrow in flip flops. Ya feel me ? sum it up. NYC is PHAT but San Diego is reasonable as far as SoCal living IMHO. The thing that resonates in my head is that every single city I‚Äôve lived in a had rent bills and no matter how expensive or cheap a place was I would always have the same level of living. Like not any broker not any richer. It all became just a number. Sure when someone points out how much property was and I give a short gasp but remembering shitty places I‚Äôve moved to and trip out.

On a personal level, you can always not identify with any of the social identities, but on the social level it is up to the community, so, for example, if you were a secular or a reform convert Jew, you will not be recognized by the Orthodox institutions including the state of Israel. Another example, I was taking care of Jewish Ukrainian refugees in Jerusalem, and here‚Äôs a family of a Jewess (certified) with her two kids, whose birth certificates were lost in Ukraine, and who were not recognized as Jews, so they can not become citizens (temporarily I hope). This is how Jews become non-Jews."},{"instruction":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","output":"Do you enjoy the thrill of getting a new car every 1‚Äì3 years?

It‚Äôs the same as if you loved Broadway shows and went to one every month - this is part of your discretionary budget! Doing things you enjoy with your money =) P.S.

All news organizations have some level of bias, whether it is conscious or unconscious, and this can be influenced by factors such as the political leanings of the owner, the advertisers, or the target audience. It can be difficult to determine the most neutral, objective, nonpartisan, and unbiased news sources in the US as different people have different opinions on what constitutes \\"neutral\\" and \\"objective.\\" However, here are a few news organizations that are generally considered to have a reputation for fairness and impartiality: Associated Press (AP) - A global news organization that is widely considered to be one of the most impartial sources of news.Reuters - A multinational news organization that strives for accuracy, impartiality, and objectivity in its reporting.BBC News - The US edition of the British Broadcasting Corporation, known for its impartial and balanced reporting.NPR - National Public Radio, a nonprofit news organization that is funded by the public and aims to provide accurate and impartial reporting.The Wall Street Journal - A well-respected news organization that is known for its comprehensive coverage and balanced reporting.

When I was still mobile, I realized just how much things change, even when you gain a little weight. Distances become bigger, literally, because you wont walk that fast, and its mentally exhausting just thinking about it, before you even get up to attempt those distances. All spaces, chairs, tables and any normal social area is either a hard no, if it's even just nearly a little tight; or a yes, but I'll sit on the thing that can support 800 pounds because I'll break your entire dining room set. Cars are a no. Front or backseat, it's just not possible. I'd need a carseat that would be a 4x4 of itself, just one of my legs fills up the ENTIRE space where someone would sit, I mean from head to footrest, seat to dashboard. So when I would have had to have gone places, my parents just rented out a Van. School was.. odd. I was almost 7 feet tall, and needed to gain weight desperately, my heart saw I had no body fat whatsoever, so it beat so much slower, but I still had a lot of, body, for it to pump through so it couldnt figure out why, and instead of just going faster, it started to tear itself apart for unknown reasons. But I gained weight, joined the girls basketball team, and made some friends, but after a few years it became a food addiction, and i became immobile halfway through 9th grade but for that have other answers you can take a look at because I wont go through typing it again, But basically, you get the 6th sense of a hyena, but the mass of an elephant, you get to sniff out awkward social interactions and see spaces and distances you'll get stuck in (which is a story for another day) and cant cross, coupled with the slowness and size (but a lot more strength too because your muscles need to be able to support all that weight so I'd look like a bodybuilder if all the fat was just lifted off of me lol) of an African gray."},{"instruction":"Aishwarya Rai overrated?","output":"If you talk in terms of beauty that she is then NO!

We really don‚Äôt care about money, power, accolades, recognition, fame, or having other people agree with us or even being liked if it comes down to being disingenuous for that purpose. Agree with us too much and we will like you a whole lot less, or at least have no respect for you. I‚Äôm not saying we don‚Äôt care about people‚Äôs feelings, of course if we like you, we most definitely want you to feel good around us. We just see no value in the trappings of success or social recognition as far as society goes, and I‚Äôd even take that a step further and say we find it crass, shallow and ultimately empty and worthless, even more so if it‚Äôs built on falsehoods and deception. Since coming on here, I‚Äôve come to a conclusion about what purpose we serve in society, and I believe that purpose is to stand outside society and observe and critique it, to generate the ideas which drive progress. To ask the right questions to refine and improve society for the benefit of all residents of this blue ball, which sounds lofty but even micro-improvements on an interpersonal level are better than having a negative impact or none at all. Our inability to be swayed by popular approval and conventional thought and emotion, I think, is an intrinsic part of that function."},{"instruction":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","output":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children? We had a foster daughter to whom we gave an old Toyota pickup truck (a small one) to get around in. It was the only auto we had to give her at the time, but at 17 it was the first wheels she‚Äôd ever had, and she highly prized the independence of being able to drive herself around. She was a pretty good kid (no drugs or alcohol, and she was very selective about the boys she dated), but she tested us from time to time. Since my other two kids were babies, she was the first kid I had to actually ground. But we had a great idea. We didn‚Äôt ground her, we ground the truck. She could go anywhere she wanted, but she couldn‚Äôt drive the truck. This meant she had to get rides to school and to her friends‚Äô house, or walk. It was sufficient to drive the point home that misbehavior carried consequences, yet it removed the shame from the punishment.

It's also possible that the person may not have the resources, support or information to leave the relationship.

The people who do embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC) research define ‚Äúpluripotent stem cell‚Äù as having 3 characteristics: Able to differentiate to phenotypes (cell types) of all 3 dermal layers in culture. This is usually done by simply withdrawing an agent that prevents the cells from differentiatingAble to form teratomas (a type of tumor) when implanted en mass in vivoAble to form a chimeric animal when a few cells are injected into a blastocyst Both ESCS and iPSCs meet all 3 criteria. iPSCs are adult cells turned into ESCs by the transduction of 4 genes into the adult cells: Oct-4 (POU5F1), SOX2, NANOG, and c-myc. ESCs express high levels of Oct-4, SOX2, and NANOG Teratomas have been observed. Fortunately, they are rare, because they are ugly and scary tumors. Look up the images on the web. Most teratomas form in the genital regions, but some are in the mediastinem ‚Äî which is the center of the chest around the sternum.. That adults can have teratomas iimplies that there are pluripotent stem cells in the adult. However, most of the time they are under growth control and do not form a tumor. There are papers in the literature that describe the isolation and differentiation of stem cells from adults that differentiate into cell types of all 2 dermal lineages. Catharine Verfaillie‚Äôs Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are so reported. Urestricted Somatic Stem Cells (USSCs) are also reported to have a similar differentiative ability. USSCs are usually isolated from cord blood or placenta, however. Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELs) have been isolated from adult bone marrow. They have been reported to differentiate into cell types of all 3 dermal lineages in vitro and, in culture, to form embryoid bodies similar to what ESCs or iPSCs) form. VSELS also express Oct-4, SOX2, and NANOG: [LINKED_TEXT: Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells: Biology and Therapeutic Potential for Heart Repair] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3159118/#%3A~%3Atext%3DVery%20small%20embryonic-like%20stem%20cells%20(VSELs)%20represent%20a%2Cmice%20and%20CD133%20in%20humans.%26text%3DIndeed%2C%20quiescent%20VSELs%20may%20represent%2Cderived%20cells%20in%20adult%20organs]. The paper under my name above describes a stem cell isolated from adult rats that differentiate into cell types of all dermal layers. No stem cell isolated from an adult has ever been shown to form a teratoma. Also, none of the people working with adult stem cells have ever, to my knowledge, attempted to make a chimera with them. Bottom line: ESC and iPSC researchers say there are no pluripotent adult stem cells. Some people who work with adult stem cells are not so sure."},{"instruction":"w was it that Sandy Koufax was not a unanimous selection to the Baseball Hall of Fame?","output":"Probably because nobody had ever been elected unanimously. And the writers can be pretty funny about it. Curt Schilling is not in the HOF and Jack Morris and Jim Kaat are. I do not know if there are PED allegations against him, but he is not in the HOF.

In his next six years he was 129‚Äì47 in 1632.2 innings with a156 ERA+ and a WAR of 46.4. Over those six years he was the best pitcher in baseball and probably the first great pitcher of the television age and a product of California and the whole thing around it.

He did have a great peak but others, before and since have had better peaks. The best peak ever was by Water Johnson from 1912‚Äì16, but that was before 1920. And the reason I start at 1920 is because pitchers could not pitch dead ball innings anymore without going lame in about a year or so There have been 13 Peak WARS of over 40 since 1920 by 12 different pitchers. But lets examine only the ones that happened before Koufax was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Lefty Grove 1929‚Äì33 46.0 (though he could have qualified 1928‚Äì32 with 44.7) Lefty Grove 1935‚Äì39 42.6 Bob Feller 1939‚Äì47 42.2 (Feller was occupied helping to save democracy from 1942‚Äì45) Hal Newhouser 1944‚Äì48 40.9 Robin Roberts 1950‚Äì54 42.6 Sandy Koufax 1962‚Äì66 40.7 Bob Gibson 1968‚Äì72 42.5 Now WAR did not exist in 1972, but won lost records and ERAs did. His ERAs were the lowest, so that helped, but we know that in context his peak was more in line with other pitchers. He had a 111‚Äì34 record; only Lefty Grove‚Äôs 128‚Äì33 was better in 1929‚Äì33 and 128‚Äì33 if you picked 1928‚Äì32. but you cannot overlap peaks. HIs record was cleaner than other guys big peaks like Robin Roberts and Bob Feller. He never lost double digit games during his peak. He led the league in ERA every year, something nobody else has done. But we now know that he only won two ERA+ titles, but that was not considered in 1972. Sandy got 86.9% of the votes; Early Wynn got 76%. But in 1947, 25 year earlier two left handers were elected, Carl Hubbell 87% and Lefty Grove 76.4%. That is how life is. You are dealing with irrationality. Some writers just hated Lefty Grove because he could be a real jerk, and they took it into the voting booth with them. Anybody who saw Grove and Hubbell knew that Grove was better; his record reflects it, but Hubbell was more popular. We do it today with Curt Schilling. I cannot stand his politics and his big mouth, but he is a HOF pitcher. Sandy did not have to put up with that. He got in first ballot and should have, but so should have Lefty Grove and Curt Schilling. [LINKED_TEXT: 1972 Hall of Fame Voting | Baseball-Reference.com1972 Hall of Fame Voting Results.

Outside of any Jewish or Christian ideology is an actual archaeological record and according to that record every inch of planet earth was once submerged under water. DID YOU KNOW‚Ä¶. SEA FOSSILS WERE FOUND AT THE TOP OF MT EVEREST? HOW DID THEY GET THERE? OH I KNOW, Sir Edmond Hillary himself had his Sherpa guides carry them up there where he carefully deposited them. WRONG. DID YOU KNOW THE EARTH WAS AT ONE TIME 1/2 THE SIZE IT IS NOW? Oh yes it was and even further the entire standing water body was at that time enveloped IN THE ATMOSPHERE where it gave superior radiation protection and formed an actual GREENHOUSE which was not only described to have been in the GARDEN OF EDEN of Biblical lore but also the most ancient writing of Buddhists and Hindus. Something happened that PIERCED THAT CANOPY which caused it to rupture in several places which was can identify because just like when you take a 5 gallon bucket of water and pour it onto dirt it eats a huge crater‚Ä¶. this was/is how both the Marianas Trench and the Great Laurethian Abyss was created as well as how the earth was SPLIT and made into a pear shaped body with 60 of its mass being in the southern hemisphere. THAT CRACK ENCIRCLES THE PLANET TO THIS DAY AND IS WHAT FUELS THE JET STREAM. But when the canopy was ruptured it also CAUSED A GREAT VACUUM WHICH ACTED EXACTLY LIKE HOW A GLASS LIGHT BULB IS FORMED AND EXERTION OF THAT OUTWARD PRESSURE SUCKED THE PLANET INTO A BIGGER SIZE WHILE ALSO CREATING MEGA CAVES SYSTEMS THAT ENCIRCLE THE GLOBE. One could actually travel from New York City to Los Angeles COMPLETELY UNDERGROUND VIA THIS CAVERN SYSTEM which is carefully guarded for national security reasons. NOTE: THE OCEANS COVER 2/3 OF THE EARTHS SURFACE NOW. IF THE EARTH WAS 1/2 THE SIZE THEY COULD EASILY COVER THE PLANET AS SUSPENDED IN THE ATMOSPHERE. NOTE: EVERY DAY IN THE CLOUDS THERE IS ENOUGH ACTUAL WATER SUSPENDED IN THE ATMOSPHERE TO FILL THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND THIS IS ONGOING. DURING TYPHOON AND HURRICANE EVENTS THAT AMOUNT OF SUSPENDED WATER MAY EASILY BE EQUAL TO THE INDIAN OCEAN. I know hard core mountain climbers and it is well known among them that SEA FOSSILS ARE FOUND IN HIGHLY REMOTE AND IMPOSSIBLE PLACES LIKE THE SUMMIT OF K2, ANNAPURNA, ETC. Only by the actual archaeological and geological records can the truth be known and this is NOT ACCORDING TO ANY SPECIFIC RELIGIOUS BELIEF BUT ACCORDING TO ANCESTRAL KNOWLEDGE AS A WHOLE AMONG MANKIND. NOTE: THE DINOSAUR KILLER ASTEROID THAT FORMED THE CARIBBEAN SEA IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE EVENT THAT RUPTURED THAT CANOPY WHICH ALSO DUE TO LOSS OF WARMTH AND EXPOSURE TO SPACE FOR THE FIRST TIME CREATED THE ICE AGE. In geological circles these facts are basically accepted and the Christian Bible only serves as 1 AMONG MANY SOURCES THAT TELL OF THIS GLOBAL EVENT. NOTE: EVERY ANCIENT CULTURE IN THE WORLD HAS RECORD OF A GREAT FLOOD THAT COVERED THE ENTIRE WORLD. THE TIME OF THE EVENT AS WELL AS MANY OTHER FACTS ALL COMPARE ALMOST EXACTLY WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT OF NOAH AND HIS FAMILY‚Ä¶. although even the ancient Hindi writings tell of him as well. SO HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? NOTE: there are over 10,000 actual photos of a giant wooden ship on Mt Ararat Turkey. These were almost all taken during WWII while American and British pilots were flying supplies to China to help them fend off the Japanese aggression. During the 1950‚Ä≤s the USSR Kremlin undertook a massive expedition to that site and found and documented that vessel even to the point to TAKING MEASUREMENTS OF EVERY INCH OF IT. In the late 1960‚Äôs there was a massive quake on that mountain where one side of it dropped several thousand feet in one event and that most certainly buried the ark, but remnants of a TAR SATURATED OAK have been brought back and carbon dating places the age almost exactly to the time of the flood event by ancestral records. MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO STOP TRYING TO DISCREDIT CHRISTIANITY AND TO BEGIN TO LOOK AT A MUCH MUCH BIGGER PICTURE IN WHICH ALL OF MANKIND SHARES THE EXACT SAME RECORDS OF THESE PAST EVENTS. THAT IS THE REAL POINT. As far as the BIBLE is concerned, there are many HIGHLY ACCURATE PARTS and many others that have been altered. It makes for a very credible record of many historical places, times, peoples, and events that in some cases have ONLY BEEN VERIFIED TO HAVE BEEN FROM THAT DOCUMENT and the chief of those was/is a place called THE CITY OF UR which was down river from Sodom & Gemoreh but buried beneath the desert sand UNTIL ARCHAEOLOGISTS WANTING TO DISPROVE THE BIBLE UNDERTOOK THEIR WON EXPEDITION TO THAT SITE AND TODAY THE ENTIRE LOST CITY IS RECOVERED. RECORDS ARE RECORDS AND THERE VALUE EXISTS IN THEIR ACTUAL ACCOUNTS OF THINGS WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE KN WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT. EVERY ANCIENT CULTURE ON EARTH HAS RECORDS OF A GREAT FLOOD EVENT AND THAT INCLUDES YOUR OWN CULTURE BUT ALL ARE INCLUDED. Given the vast distances from CHINA TO MACHU PICHU IN PERU HOW WOULD THAT BE POSSIBLE VIA SHARED INFORMATION? And even more so, how could that have been several thousand years before the concept of CHRISTIANITY EXISTED? Please go study archaeology and actual geological records.

Cold weather, unpredictable economic prospects, high costs of living, and an inherently dysfunctional system of national governance means that intrinsically Canada is a dreadful and miserable place to live in. To my American friends who point to their President as indication of the dysfunction of their nation, I‚Äôll point out that the American system of governance has so many checks and balances in place, compared to Canada and most of the world, the US is the most politically stable nation on earth. I contrast the US to Canada largely because comparing ourselves to Americans is a national pastime for Canadians, but there is a general (and I think unfair) sense among Canadians that Americans are rude and impolite. Further contrasting the US to Canada, generally speaking, the US overall is intrinsically better than Canada on the basis of stability, prosperity, and economy. It is my opinion that the general perspective among Canadians about Americans being rude and impolite stems from the observations of the urbanized, cosmopolitan parts of America. The highly populated American regions that are hubs of culture and commerce, but not universally representative of the American experience. Personally, as an Albertan, I love Montana, Idaho, Utah, and to a lesser degree east Washington State - but these ‚Äúflyover‚Äù regions are NOT New York, California, or Texas (at least as portrayed by Hollywood). In reality, most of Canada is like the American flyover states. Canada is not urbanized and even in the parts that are, there are enough sources of inalienable misery that without being connected with your community, you don‚Äôt stand a chance. Toronto and Vancouver come close to the exception and while we like to make fun of Torontonians and Vancouverites for either being snobbish, weak or we hate their hockey teams and want American teams to win the Stanley cup instead of theirs - the people are still generally better off than in the American metropolises in terms of embodying Canadian politeness, kindness, and generosity. To understand Canadian character, we can use my hometown, Calgary, to illustrate the Canadian mindset. It is not as cold as the rest of the Canadian prairies but at least half the year it is cold, unpredictable and miserable. Every few years there are total economic meltdowns that are deeply humbling to everyone. Most of the time, those meltdowns are caused by factors completely out of our regional control such as American government policy, Canadian national government policy, provincial government infighting, or global geopolitical events. Growing up in the 80‚Äôs, the recession was so bad my Dad walked away from his house after I was born. At the time, he might have sold the house for 1 on the market. He lost his first 5 years of savings after graduating from University as a mechanical engineer - and told me stories how he was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù he could still secure financing for another home for us. It was a very traumatic experience for him. That recession gripped the entire western half of the country for the better part of a decade, and was followed up by similar recessions across the country in the 90‚Äôs and 2000‚Äôs that, while not as equally severe, was still deeply humbling. A great illustration was how the entire province of Newfoundland had its entire provincial economy collapse in the 1990‚Äôs after the Federal government completely mismanaged their cod fishery industry. Half the province ended up unemployed and moving to Alberta to work in the oil industry in what the great Canadian orator, Rex Murphy, dubbed as ‚ÄúThe Greatest Canadian rescue operation of modern times.‚Äù I grew up in rural Northern Alberta which, in the long winter you could describe as ‚Äúhell frozen over‚Äù and simply ‚Äúhell‚Äù in the summer from the wildfires that tend to destroy entire cities every few years. As an oil patch kid up north, we would tell Newfie jokes and tease the Newfie kids. We didn‚Äôt realize back then that there were probably more of those kids from Newfoundland than those of us from Alberta. In hindsight, loving my province and loving our oil industry, I thank God for those Newfie families, because the great oil boom of the 2000‚Äôs would not have been possible without them. Regardless, from Cape Race, Newfoundland to Nootka Sound, B.C. and everywhere in between, the Canadian experience was, is, and always will be deeply humbling, sometimes unbearably miserable, and often times from which the only reprieve is in the community you form with your fellow Canadians. In my mind this is the reason Canadians are so polite. Life is hard enough anywhere in Canada. It would be impossible without cooperation and community with the Canadians suffering along with you. Moreover, the communities you form in Canada can often sustain you and get you through those very difficult times. They can even make it so in spite of the misery of being in Canada, it can actually be a wonderful experience being Canadian."},{"instruction":"Can foreigners in US invest in US stock market?","output":"Yes they can ,living her or any where around the world"},{"instruction":"What is the most dangerous place on Earth?","output":"The most dangerous single thing on Earth? This. Here‚Äôs another view. Still not seeing it? What about this? No? Okay, maybe if I show you this? No, it‚Äôs not the Bison, though they can be dangerous if they take a dislike to you. Or the road, though that can also be dangerous if you don‚Äôt pay attention while driving (I mean, you could drive right into a Bison, and that wouldn‚Äôt be fun for anyone involved). Maybe you need another clue? Yes, hilly terrain and mountain rivers can be a bit dangerous, but surely not all that dangerous, right? I know, it can‚Äôt be all that dangerous if there are all those people there, right? What if I tell you that those are all photographs of the same part of the world? Geting a clue yet? Okay, how about something that makes it a bit more obvious? Yeah, you guessed it. Yellowstone National Park, home to Bison, Bears, and a plethora of geysers and hot springs. But Yellowstone National Park also happens to lie on top of one of the largest supervolcanoes known to science. Yellowstone Caldera, the part of the supervolcano lying right on top of the Yellowstone Hot Spot, lies to the north of Yellowstone Lake and measures 43 miles by 28 miles. By comparison, the heavy ashfall zone that surrounded the 1980 Mount St Helens eruption, with ash up to several feet in depth, was around 30 miles by 20, and came from a caldera just a couple of hundred yards in diameter. When (not if) the Yellowstone caldera next erupts, it will make Mount St Helens look like a party popper. Where I live in the UK, I remember cleaning my mum‚Äôs car windscreen every morning before school for a month as every morning there would be a small but noticeable film of ash coating it that made it difficult to see out of. When Yellowstone next erupts, the amount of ash in the skies will be orders of magnitude greater Sunlight will be blocked off for days, weeks, perhaps even months, with greatly lowered temperatures for years, and a massive drop in agriculture throughout the entire world. It will be accompanied by an unknown (but presumably huge) volume of toxic fumes which would certainly make life in the immediate surroundings (at least within the >1,000mm zone in the map above, possibly more depending on the prevailing winds) untenable. The death toll from the eruption itself might not be that large (the area is fairly sparsely populated, after all), but the after effects will be a global devastation the likes of which the Human race has never before endured. Despite all that, it won‚Äôt be the end of the world, probably not even the end of the United States (though it will certainly be a catastrophe that will forever change the nation). It‚Äôs just that the survivors will be living in a world very different from that which existed pre-eruption. That‚Äôs the bad news. The good news is that it has been roughly 680,000 years since the last eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera, and although it is due another eruption ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù that is in geological terms, and could mean anything from next week to 250,000 years from now, and it is likely that any such eruption will be preceded by months, if not years, of increased seismic activity, so the chances of any of us being around to witness it are pretty slim."},{"instruction":"Why do Barack and Michelle‚Äôs daughters smell so bad?","output":"Geez‚Ä¶.soooo immature, lame and sooo you!"},{"instruction":"Are bank tellers allowed to ask why you are withdrawing a lot of cash from your account?","output":"a teller may ask to ensure the customer is not angry with the Bank/employee before the bank having the opportunity to rectify an issue.

Generally speaking, the call history of a mobile phone number is considered private information that is not publicly available. Some service providers may allow you to view call history through your account management portal, while others may only provide information to authorized parties with a valid court order. In some cases, it may also be possible to retrieve call history data from a phone directly, if you have access to the device. As a language model, I don't have the capability to create a blog but here's a general overview of the topic: The call history of a mobile phone number is a record of all the incoming and outgoing calls made from that phone. This information can include the phone numbers of the calls, the date and time of the calls, and the duration of the calls. Access to this information is typically restricted for privacy reasons, as it can reveal sensitive information about a person's personal and professional relationships. In some cases, service providers may allow you to view your own call history through your account management portal. For example, if you have an account with AT&T, you can log into the AT&T website and view your call history online. Other service providers may provide a similar service, but availability and accessibility may vary depending on the provider. In other cases, access to call history information may only be available to authorized parties with a valid court order. This means that if you want to retrieve the call history of someone else's phone number, you will need to go through the legal process of obtaining a court order. This process can be complicated and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee that you will be able to retrieve the information that you are seeking. In some cases, it may also be possible to retrieve call history data from a phone directly, if you have access to the device. This can be done by backing up the phone's data or using specialized software to extract the information. However, this approach can be technically challenging, and it may also be illegal in some jurisdictions to access someone else's phone without their permission. In conclusion, the call history of a mobile phone number is typically considered private information that is not publicly available. Access to this information may be possible through your service provider or by obtaining a court order, but availability and accessibility will vary depending on the specific circumstances."},{"instruction":"What is ‡§§‡§æ‡§ú‡§Æ‡§π‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§®‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç?","output":"‡§§‡§æ‡§ú‡§Æ‡§π‡§≤ ‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•Å‡§®‡§æ ‡§®‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§á‡§∏‡•á ‡§∂‡§æ‡§π‡§ú‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ"},{"instruction":"Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?","output":"Holocaust Death camps were labeled a conspiracy theory by Germany, and for a while by everyone else in the world.

However, here are some strategies that might help: 1. Exercise and physical activity: Strengthening the muscles in your back and core can provide support and alleviate pain. Focus on exercises that target the lower back, such as bridges, planks, and gentle stretches. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional or a physical therapist to ensure you're doing the exercises correctly and to get recommendations tailored to your specific condition. 2. Maintain good posture: Poor posture can strain your lower back. Be mindful of your sitting and standing posture, and consider using ergonomic chairs and supportive cushions if needed. When lifting heavy objects, remember to use your legs instead of your back to minimize strain. 3. Apply heat or cold: Applying a heating pad or taking a warm bath can help relax tense muscles and alleviate pain. Cold packs or ice wrapped in a cloth can help reduce inflammation. Experiment with both heat and cold to see which works best for you, and limit the application to about 15-20 minutes at a time. 4. Over-the-counter pain medications: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce pain and inflammation. However, it's important to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications. 5. Improve your sleeping environment: Ensure your mattress provides adequate support for your back. If needed, consider using a mattress topper or a pillow under your knees to maintain a neutral spinal alignment while sleeping. 6 Mind-body techniques: Practices like yoga, tai chi, and meditation can promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve flexibility and strength, which may alleviate lower back pain. 7. Avoid prolonged sitting or standing: If your job or daily activities involve extended periods of sitting or standing, try to take breaks and change your position frequently. Gentle stretching and walking can help prevent stiffness and reduce strain on your lower back."},{"instruction":"Do sunset towns still exist in America where only whites are allowed after dark?

This means that when you are not eating, your body can access stored fat for energy, which helps to keep you feeling satisfied and full.High protein intake: Protein is one of the most satiating macronutrients, meaning that it can help you feel full for longer periods of time. Eating protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and tofu can help to reduce hunger between meals.Fiber-rich foods: Foods that are high in fiber, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, can also help to keep you feeling full. This is because fiber takes longer to digest, which means it stays in your stomach for longer and slows down the emptying of your stomach.Intermittent fasting: Some people who eat only once or twice a day may also practice intermittent fasting, where they restrict their eating window to a certain period of time each day.

In All things, moderation. You are way too young to be *worried* about grown up things, but the earlier you mature, the better off you wil be in life. The way that I see that relating to moderation is, begin planning for your future now, by dedicating yourself to getting good grades and having extra-curicular activities. Not only do the activities (and grades) help with higher education (we no longer live in a world where you can expect to succeed without at the very least a 2-3 year ‚Äúassociates‚Äù degree, if not more, so don't even think this is optional) but you will find friends that share similar interests, and mentors that will help you with written recommendations for school admissions. Find SOMETHING that interests you, like sports or a musical instrument, and no matter what find at least 1 charity that supports what you support and volunteer, because all other activities are selfish in comparison (sportsmanship is good but you really wouldn't play if you didn't enjoy it and get to hang out with friends, charity, on the other hand, only points outwards). The way to approach this in moderation is by realizing you are young and may think you enjoy something at first, but maybe not after trying it. Don't beat yourself up and find something else if the first thing you try doesn't work for you. Please allow me to digress a moment. When I was younger, younger than you are now, my mother took time out of her schedule and talk me to play keyboard (for some strange reason, she had an organ, like what you would expect to see at an old church), I remember being fairly proficient at it, but I didn't enjoy it and I stopped just as soon as she let me, but thats a mistake I regret even today (I'm almost 50 and just bought an electronic keyboard hoping to relearn). It wasn't until my teens that I was actually forced back in to music, because my step-sister wanted to join our churches youth choir and since she and i were both high school aged, our parents made me go with her, but eventually i started enjoying it and really wish i couod play along while i sing. Try your best to avoid the party scene (yes, thats the sex, drugs and alcohol). But, if you find yourself caught up with friends, first, be sure they don't pressure you in to ANYTHING. I hubg out woth people who did various drugs, sometimes right in front of me, but I only ever consumed alcohol, and once I turned 21, I actually stopped drinking beer, but i will moderately drink hard liquor (that means 1 to 2 an hour, depending on how strong the drink and how i feel while drinking it). If you are female (sorry, i didnt even check your name or pic to see) ALWAYS have someone with you that you trust and look after each other‚Ä¶ it is NEVER worth your safety to get so hammered that you black out or at the very least agree to something you later regret! Again, when it comes to friends, id you ever feel pressured in to ANYTHING, ditch them IMMEDIATELY. There is a little secret that most young people don't ‚Äúget‚Äù about ‚Äúcool‚Äù people. The ‚Äúcool‚Äù people are the way they are because they are ‚Äúdoing them‚Äù and dont care what other people think about them. So, NEVER waste your effort trying to impress other people, even the opposite sex, (or same if that's the way you lean). Just BE YOU and let those that dont like it go their own way. You will find a group to belong to, even if, like me, it was people who didn't fit into any other group.

Can anyone offer any SEO tips to help improve my SERP ranking on Google?","output":"I dont know what kind of adult site is yours but here is the guide for for adult e-commerce site and the same should apply same for any adult site. Marketing and driving traffic to an sex toy e-commerce store is not an easy task. If you don't have a brand for yourself then establishing an authority in the industry can be tricky and time consuming. Most people look for trusted adult toy stores while making the purchase because this isn't something which is a normal buy and people who buy it wants to make sure that everything is safe and secured. If you are a brand new sex toy store or having tuff time driving traffic to your adult toy store then follow the below suggestions. I'm sure it will help. SEO SEO should be your number one priority when driving traffic to your website. Target low competition and long tail keywords starting out. If you target high competition and short tail keywords then you wont reach anywhere because there are already well established sites ranking for it and competing with them is near to impossible. Next step in SEO is create a blog page and write articles about sex toys, sex advice or anything that matches your website and products. Getting traffic to your blog is the easiest way to make more sales of your products. Next is create backlinks for your product pages. There are lot of methods of doing this but one of the best and effective method is though guest posting or outreaching to other websites or blogs. In your case you should be looking for adult sites for example adult blogs that writes adult related articles, sex blogs, the blogs that write about sex toys etc. Dont waste time outreaching and sending mails for non adult related blogs as they will barely accept anything related to sex and adult. So your main target sites should be adult content sites. Doing this will help greatly to increase your rankings in the google for your target keywords. Better Rankings = Better Traffic = Better Sales! I would say spend most of your time in SEO and optimising your e-commerce website. Influencers Well, this works great as well. As your are in adult niche, try reaching out for TikTok models and make them to do the thing for your and promote your adult toy. Especally reach out for models like bikini models or may be even OnlyFans models! If you ask me getting in touch with OnlyFans models can do some real magic if the model has loyal following! Obviously, this will cost a bit of money but if the tiktoker has huge fan following then the expose you can get for your adult store can be massive! These 2 i.e SEO and influencers would be my go-to method especially when promoting your e-commerce sex toy store. The other promotional ways to drive traffic can include: Social Media (especially twitter)Comminity engagementAd banners on other sitesPromoting your products with the help of twitter modelsAffiliate partnership with other brands or individual bloggersPR campaignsYouTubers (Would work great. there are lot of YouTubers who talk about sex and stuff. There are even a lot of adult models and OnlyFans models who have youtube channels with good subscribers. So make sure you reach out to them as well.) But if you ask me, branding your site, ranking for your keywords in top 10 results of Google and getting quality links to your site is the best long term strategy for your adult sex toy e-commerce business!! Hope you got some idea and my answer was helpful!"},{"instruction":"Will it be a cake walk for the SP, BSP alliance to win the Uttar Pradesh election?

It‚Äôs not nano-tech but it‚Äôs a good design that can come into consideration. An antique that can just make an appearance in his home, because you have to have steampunk. A heavy suit consisting of better defense and better offense. Orange, white and black design is a pretty good scheme as it looks like another space designed suit.

Efficiency and productivity are two important elements in order for you to become good at what you do. Working in the competitive world of business as a sales representative, you'd have to find the right balance between pursuing a qualified lead until you get that sweet yes to score conversion and knowing when to stop going after a prospect, save losses, and move on to the next target is also key. Sales is one of the most demanding aspects of a business. After finding hundreds of leads, sales teams then have to qualify each one of them who have a high possibility of converting into a paid subscriber. This phase alone takes time and resources and there's no guarantee that all of the leads you have qualified to the best of your ability will actually go through the finish line. With this kind of responsibility upon the shoulders of every sales team, getting the right tools is really important to help take care of a lot of tasks that are part of their roles. One of the really important tools that a sales team should have is a BPM tool that has a built-in integration to help automate and hook it with other tools. Having a [LINKED_TEXT: BPM tool] [URL: https://windowsreport.com/automated-checklist-software/] that will help sales representatives track what part of the processes they run through each day are finished and what still needs doing.

CRM is another important tool for sales. Although it's main function is to help take care of existing customers, sales is still involved because there is a chance of upselling an existing account.

They lie at the very heart of Britain‚Äôs cultural history. An older, lesser-known but quite delightful British legend, however, tells the tale of the pre-Roman Prince Bladud, the father of King Leir, immortalized in Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Tragedie of King Lear‚Äù. According to legend, poor Bladud son of King Rud, was afflicted with a mysterious skin disease (ostensibly leprosy) while studying in Athens. When he returned to Britain, he was promptly locked up to prevent contagion. At the time, it was common to banish lepers to a life of isolation. Bladud was eventually released and banished. In some versions of the story he escaped but, whichever version you prefer he made his way in the world as a ‚Äòswineherd‚Äô. Many of his pigs seemed to suffer from the same ailment he did and, presumably to find relief, they would sometimes wander off and return covered in black mud. To his astonishment, Bladud noticed that the porkers who swanned off to roll about in ‚Äòmud, mud, glorious mud‚Äô were miraculously cured of their affliction. Now remember, this wasn‚Äôt in Scandinavia, the Low Countries or Flanders where there were many swamps and bogs, but in Britain. Bladud was probably in modern-day Somerset whose rolling landscape, in Pre-Roman times, was heavily forested with few bogs or mudholes. Bladud decided to follow his pigs the next time they wandered off. They disappeared into a grove of Alders which often grow in wetlands, along stream beds and in marshy areas. The alder was considered sacred by the ancient Britons and imbued with all sorts of magical and medicinal properties. When he found a strange-smelling ooze of black mire, he decided to try it himself. He climbed in, discovered that the mud was warm and soothing, and began to doze. When he woke, his leprosy (if that‚Äôs indeed what it was) had magically disappeared. Bladud returned in triumph to his father‚Äôs hearth and resumed his place as his heir-apparent. In gratitude for his own cure, he told others of the miraculous mud and created a sort of shrine nearby. In later life, he was associated with all sorts of necromancy, wizardry and witchcraft. According to legend. he even tried his hand at flying, but ran into a brick wall ‚Äî literally! More than 600 years after Bladud‚Äôs discovery of the healing spring, the Romans re-discovered the place and, in the Roman style, created an elaborate bathing complex on the site.

I am originally from India and I now call Australia home. When I arrived in Perth in 2015, I knew no one here. For the first 6 months, my life revolved solely around my work place and home and some trips to local places of interest ‚Äì alone. Having lived a very social and outgoing life in India, I found it difficult at first to adjust to my new life in Perth. After spending a few weeks in a new country, one does feel overwhelmed at the shocking drop in social interaction. It‚Äôs in times like these that you need to figure out how to build a network in your new hometown. Here are a few tips from my own experiences in Australia: 1. Your neighbors: Start with your neighbors. When you see them out and about, simply stop by to say hi and introduce yourself. You might be surprised by the response that you receive! If you are too shy for this, you may drop hand-written notes in your neighbors‚Äô letter boxes, so when they see you next time, at least they know your name ‚Äì it‚Äôs an easy way to initiate a conversation! 2. Your local library: Visit your local library and register yourself. Look for opportunities to volunteer. Sessions like CoderDojo forums for teenagers, or basic computer classes for senior citizens are very popular at local libraries. Volunteer for such sessions. 3. Toastmasters: Look for a Toastmasters club in your area. Your local library could have information about this. Toastmasters is a great way to improve your communications skills in a safe environment, is often open for individuals of all skill levels and is a great way to meet new people and make friends. 4. Learn a new art/ skill: You will often find free art and craft classes advertised at your local library. Similarly your local Bunnings store will often conduct workshops for different trades. So if something like glass painting or woodwork or carpentry interests you, go ahead and make the most of such opportunities. 5. Local neighborhood events: Visit local events in your neighborhood. These are a great way to understand which family businesses operate in your locality and give you the chance to listen to/ watch some local artists while they perform. You might also consider volunteering for such events - managing traffic on local streets or directing vehicles towards car parks etc. 6. Sign up for a flyer distribution service: This serves multiple purposes. Firstly, if you are new to a place and are looking to make some money, this lets you do that. Secondly, you get to explore nearby localities entirely - down to every nook and corner of every street. And thirdly, while distributing flyers, you come across people mowing their lawns or walking their dogs. Chatting with people gives you the opportunity to hone your ‚Äúsmall talk‚Äù skills and potentially lets you widen your network. Just a word of caution ‚Äì it‚Äôs small talk, avoid getting too overbearing! :) 7. Your local pub: Visit your local pub over the weekend and try to mingle with the local. More than going with an agenda of ‚Äúexpanding your network‚Äù you may treat this as an opportunity to learn the local culture, the lingo, the humor (I found Aussie humor pretty difficult to understand at first), the sports that the locals follow, and social etiquette in general. 8. Meetup: The [LINKED_TEXT: Meetup] [URL: https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/] app is by far your best friend for finding people with similar interests in your vicinity. You will be surprised to see how many Meetup groups operate in your city, both - for professional as well as social purposes. Meetup groups are often the best source for meeting new people and expanding your network. Most importantly, understand that you are in a new place and that it will take a while for you to develop meaningful associations with people around you. In the meanwhile, be outgoing, be courteous, be respectful and most importantly, be friendly!"},{"instruction":"Why is butter, rather than the healthier margarine, served in restaurants?","output":"it tastes better"},{"instruction":"Will Node.js replace many backend technologies?","output":"Not ever.

Mind you, nuclear plants are big installations, and hydro plants can range in size from the massive Three Gorges Dam, producing 22,500 MW, all the way down to a small millrace in a creek that produces a few hundred Watts. A large hydro plant has a bigger footprint than an equivalent nuclear power station, and has much tighter geographical requirements since it needs a regular and sizable water flow combined with a significant fall in elevation. Nuclear plants need water as well for cooling, but a river or lake is usually quite sufficient."},{"instruction":"Why didn't Bill kill Beatrix when he had the chance just before they fought at the end of Volume 2?","output":"For some reason, I think Bill wanted to know that Beatrix had her daughter while she was in the coma and actually finish her job of killing the ones involved with the massacre at her wedding and the reason why she‚Äôs on this hunt in the first place. Also when he was talking to Elle in Vol. 1 before she had killed while she was still in her coma, he talked about how he ‚Äòput a bullet in her head, but her heart just kept on beating.‚Äô He goes on to say that the Deadly Vipers did horrible things to her (at the wedding) and when she woke up, they were going to do a whole lot more. So he purposely stopped the whole mission of Elle going to the hospital and killing her with a poison that would eventually kill her in her sleep because Bill was worried about being seen as a man who took cheap shots and the ‚Äòeasy way‚Äô when it came to getting rid of the enemy. But really he knew that when she woke up that she would wreak havoc on those who wronged her. So keeping her alive at the hospital was him already waiting for his eventual death by the hands of Beatrix Kiddo."},{"instruction":"Did Pervitin make a measurable difference to the success of Blitzkrieg in WWII?","output":"No, and anyone who claims so either has no idea how World War II warfare works or how methamphetamine works. The telltale example that the proponents of ‚Äòdrug-fueled Blitzkrieg‚Äô argument like to trot out is Guderian and Kleist‚Äôs rampage across Northern France, during Fall Gelb after breaking through the Ardennes- so let us examine it. Guderian‚Äôs vanguard crossed the Meuse on 11 May, and after pitched fighting around the bridgehead, Guderian started his westwards thrust on the morning of 14 May. German reconnaissance units from the 2. Panzer-Division made it to the Channel on 20 May, with the rest of the division arriving the next day. That‚Äôs a week of almost non-stop advance. Do you know what happens if you run on methamphetamine for a week? It is true that methamphetamine makes a person energetic, aggressive, and removes fatigue. But those last only as long as you are running on a methamphetamine high- and running on a methamphetamine high for a week and under such physical strain would likely kill you. Period. Of course, even if it didn‚Äôt, the fatigue would, because not feeling fatigue is not the same as not being tired, and excessive physical exertion is exactly as harmful to someone on Pervitin as it is to someone who isn‚Äôt. And of course, if the action of crashing through to the Atlantic wasn‚Äôt tiring enough to cause this kind of breakdown(even discounting the devastating effects of an extended methamphetamine high)‚Ä¶ then why need methamphetamine to combat fatigue? Remember, you can‚Äôt take a break in taking drugs, either. Because as mentioned above methamphetamine doesn‚Äôt actually get rid of fatigue. It merely makes you feel like it did, and the moment the effects of methamphetamine are over, the combined effect of the drug crash and the accumulated fatigue would hit like a sledgehammer and the German soldiers thus affected would be sleeping for the next couple days. If Guderian‚Äôs panzers were as high on Pervitin as people often claim, those troops would be dying en masse of heart attacks or crashing down into a zombie-like sleepiness before they even made it to the Atlantic. As anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of the battle for France knows, neither of those happened. Guderian‚Äôs Panzer troopers cross the Meuse, 12 May 1940. Not to mention‚Ä¶ Even if the soldiers on meth were able to physiologically tolerate the strain of the extended high and the physical strain of war simultaneously, a soldier on an extended meth high is a terrible soldier. The following is extracted from the story of an actual meth addict: At one stage, he went on a 10-day binge, where he smoked more than 7500 worth of meth and was consumed by fantasies, starting with the recurring belief that he was at the airport waiting to get on a plane to Thailand, when he was, in fact, in his bedroom. He told me that after a while, ‚ÄúI became convinced it was all part of a TV show plot, and that my life was a TV show, and I was being filmed all the time. ‚ÄúLike The Truman Show?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù Jack replied ‚Äúexactly like The Truman Show,‚Äù and he went on to relate how he had once confronted a girl (who had rejected him) about her role on this TV show ‚Äî she, quite naturally, freaked out. ‚ÄúEventually I started kind of performing for the camera,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúSo one day I got home after a day of smoking, believing that the cameras were on me, and I thought to myself what a boring day it had been, and that the viewers probably would have been really annoyed with me. So I stood up in my lounge room and broke out in this mad dance for 15 minutes just so the audience would be entertained.‚Äù Does it look like this is the sort of mindset that would bring you success in a campaign if you could put your soldiers into it? In fact, speaking about that‚Ä¶ another severe blow to the whole ‚ÄòGerman soldier on crack‚Äô myth is that. From Sedan to Noyelles-sur-Mer, German troops covered a little over 300 kilometers in about a week. A fit, trained person, if he didn‚Äôt have to worry about providing his own food, could do that on foot. A Roman legion could come close to marching that distance in the same time. The astonishing part of that achievement isn‚Äôt the physical strain. It‚Äôs the organizational achievement. It‚Äôs pushing through the enemy formations, it‚Äôs moving an entire panzer group through clogged up roads, it‚Äôs keeping them supplied, it‚Äôs maintaining air cover, ensuring maintenance of cohesion, providing fuel and spare parts, preventing and dealing with traffic jams. Guderian‚Äôs dash to the Channel isn‚Äôt a physically impressive feat: it‚Äôs an organizationally impressive feat. Pervitin doesn‚Äôt help with that. 7. Panzer-Division moves through France. This was the kind of challenge Germans had to deal with, hundreds of tanks and trucks that all needed supplies, all advancing through congested roads with breakneck speed. It was a monumental feat to keep these formations coherent and supplied and well organized- but it was not a feat that would be helped with any possible application of Pervitin. The single most common source of the Pervitin used by German soldiers on the front line actually was from their relatives back home, which soldiers often asked things including Pervitin to cope with the mental stress of war from. This lasted until 1941, when the Wehrmacht brutally cracked down on such deliveries from the home front. In terms of actual military-issue Pervitin, there were two common methods in which it could be used. One was for medicinal purposes, especially on the Eastern Front where it was used to assist in emergency care of hypothermia. Two was in cases where you needed those troops fighting now, and you didn‚Äôt need them for the next couple days, and preferably had somewhere safe to rest them. Pilots, especially those operating in the Defense of the Reich campaign, were common users of Pervitin for this reason: they could use it for intensive operations lasting a day or two, and then spend the next day or two sleeping it off in the barracks of their airfield. Long-lasting Pervitin highs, of the kind people are so often falsely believe to have brought Germans their 1940 success, were nonexistent. You‚Äôd think it would clue someone that the book that popularized that nonsense, Norman Ohler‚Äôs Blitzed, was written by a journalism school graduate with no history education whatsoever who hadn‚Äôt written a single book that was not fiction until that point- although, having read it, I could assure you that Ohler still hasn‚Äôt written a book that isn‚Äôt fiction. Pervitin made no measurable difference to German military success. It wasn‚Äôt used in large enough quantities to do so, and even if it was, it would have done far more harm than good to the German military machine and would have stifled rather than create victories. The notion of Hitler being carried to victory on the back of drug addicts is a revoltingly persistent myth, an attempt to reduce the culmination of two centuries of martial excellence and military know-how to the drugged rage of a junkie. It is born out of a pathological denial to admit that the German soldier prevailed because he was better trained and better led. When someone claims fervently that German military success was born out of drug abuse, what they‚Äôre actually telling you is that they‚Äôre so appalled at the fact that the German soldier fought and won fair and square in 1940 that they‚Äôd rather make up flat out lies so they can pretend there was a hidden reason to it rather than admitting what is the case. It‚Äôs them saying ‚Äòbut‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ they must have cheated!‚Äô"},{"instruction":"w much would it cost to crowdfund a mission using SpaceX to catch up and explore Oumuamua?","output":"Protip: When a question essentially asks if X is possible, and X doesn‚Äôt actually contradict any known laws of physics (e.g. travel faster than light or [LINKED_TEXT: perpetuum mobile] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetuum_mobile]), your immediate reaction should be - yes, it‚Äôs possible.

To catch up with  ªOumuamua we need a accelerate an object to be just a little fast than that. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is very fast. And there are no existing space ships that can reach such velocities. However, if all we want is to propel a small bullet-like object, that shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. This ‚Äúbullet‚Äù need only contain a camera, a tiny radio transmitter, a computer-on-chip, a long aerial wire, and miniaturized [LINKED_TEXT: radioisotope thermoelectric generator] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator] at the end of it, to provide power. Using today‚Äôs technology, each of those components could probably be made to weigh less than a few grams. Next, we need to build a rocket to accelerate it to be a little faster than  ªOumuamua. This rocket would essentially be a piggy-back payload for a SpaceX mission. Let‚Äôs see how much it would need to weigh. Using the [LINKED_TEXT: Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation] [math]Delta v = v_e cdot ln(frac{m_0}{m_f}) implies m_0 = m_f cdot e^{Delta v / v_e}[/math] where, [math]v_e[/math] is the [LINKED_TEXT: effective exhaust velocity] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_exhaust_velocity] [math]Delta v[/math] is the maximum change of velocity of the vehicle (with no external forces acting).

I tend to prefer fights that aren't quite the same thing every time or ones where you're doing something different for the entire duration while still being challenging. If it doesn't fall into one of these two categories, it better be a shorter fight like Nefra. The most variable fight is Master and Blaster in Ravagers, so often you have to make split second decisions and the mines and circle placements make every fight different. Tyrans in Dread Palace is another great example of this where I think there's really a perfect balance of consistency and dynamicism. Personally, I think fights like Tyth in Gods of the Machine goes a little far with this idea, there's just a few too many moving parts for my liking. On the different things throughout the fight side of things, you have fights like Gate Commander Draxus in Dread Fortress, Revan in Temple of Sacrifice, and Kephess in Explosive Conflict, and really all of God's from the Machine except for Tyth. It's hard to feel bored in fights like these because you're constantly doing something different. This does mean that it can feel less like you're fighting an actual boss though My overall favorite operation based on the fights is Dread Palace, I really like Bestia, Tyrans and the final Council fight there. In terms of looks, my favorite raid is Terror From Beyond, Gree technology looks so cool! There are also fights that are really not fun, particularly if they're really buggy or there are too many boring, repetitive sections without exciting things to do; especially if these mechanics are extremely punishing if you mess them up. Styrak from Scum and Villainy is the best example of this, almost 20 minutes of doing the same simple thing over and over again and you wipe if you mess it up once. Underlurker and Revanite Commanders from Temple of Sacrifice are other great examples of these two problems. Underlurker is too buggy and it isn't all that exciting, no one likes to wipe when it isn't their fault. Revanite Commanders is just a worse version of Draxus."},{"instruction":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","output":"A story from my imagination world.... ‚ÄúWhy were you talking with that girl?‚Äù, she asked him with jealousy. ‚ÄúBecause I want you to fall for me again and again‚Äù, he replied with a smile.

However, this other person will not be aware of many of the implementation details. In other words, IMO, tests should ideally be written by both the developer writing the production code and a separate person/team. More specifically unit tests, which describe the intended behavior of specific functions/classes should usually be written by the developer writing the functions/classes they test. Integration/acceptance tests, that test the behavior of the system as a whole, can benefit from being written by other people. It is, of course, possible to write unit tests through pair programming, and that can be helpful, but it‚Äôs not always very practical, since they would need to be able to pair program rather consistently."},{"instruction":"What is the new income tax slab of 202122?","output":"Greetings, In Budget 2020, the Indian Finance Minister introduced a ‚ÄòNew tax regime‚Äô with more tax slabs and lower tax rates. Therefore, now you have two options to select from: Old Tax RegimeNew Tax Regime However, the new tax regime has come with the catch of removal of all the deductions and exemptions that were available under the old tax regime. Here are some of the most common exemptions and deductions availed by Indian taxpayers If you opt for the new tax regime, all these exemptions and deductions will not bring down your taxable income Over the last 3 years, only a few opted for the New Tax Regime. Most taxpayers continued with the Old Regime as they could save higher taxes than the New one. In this year‚Äôs Budget, the government has made the New Tax Regime more attractive. It has changed the tax slab and added incentives to it. There are five such key changes. Let‚Äôs discuss them one by one. 1. Less Tax Slabs In The New Tax Regime First, the government has changed the tax slabs. You can see the previous and revised versions in the following table: As you can see, the New Tax Regime introduced in Feb 2020 Budget had seven slabs. But now the government has reduced them to six slabs. The tax outgo will be lower in the new one compared to the earlier slabs. Now let‚Äôs look at the tax slabs in the Old Tax Regime: 2. ZERO Tax For People Earning Less Than Rs 7 Lakh A Year Second, the government is offering a rebate to taxpayers earning up to Rs 7 lakh. This is a significant change. Your tax outgo will be zero if your taxable income is less than Rs 7 lakh now. Until now, this limit was Rs 5 lakh in the New Tax Regime. So, if you are earning up to Rs 7 lakh, opting for the New Tax Regime is actually attractive. You don‚Äôt have to worry about investing in tax-saving instruments like ELSS, PPF, etc. 3. Standard Deduction In New Tax Regime To Make It More Attractive Now, let‚Äôs talk about the third change. The government has introduced Standard Deduction in the New Tax Regime. This is an interesting concept. In the old regime, the salaried class used to submit medical and transport bills to claim deductions from their salaries. The government realized that this was a burden. So, it introduced standard deduction. Taxpayers could claim a straight deduction without submitting any bills. The government has brought this to the New Tax Regime. Each salaried person with an income of more than Rs 15.5 lakh can claim a standard deduction of Rs 52,500. So, if your taxable income is Rs 20 lakh, the standard deduction will reduce the taxable income to nineteen lahks forty-seven thousand and five hundred rupees (19,47,500). 4. Less Suracharge Means Less Tax For The Super Rich The fourth change pertains to the reduction in the tax rate for individuals in the highest tax bracket. Currently, if you earn more than Rs 5 crore a year, you pay 42.74% tax. This is among the highest in the world. And it‚Äôs because these taxpayers pay a high surcharge rate of 37%. This will now be reduced to 25%. This would result in a reduction of their maximum tax rate to 39% in the new tax regime instead of 42.74% earlier. 5. Leave Encashment For Retirees. There‚Äôs some good news for people who are retiring. At present, employees don‚Äôt need to pay tax when they encash leaves on retirement and receive a benefit of up to Rs 3 lakh in exchange. This limit is now increased to Rs 25 lakh. There was one big surprise in the budget in relation to the New Tax Regime. The government has set the New Tax Regime as the default tax regime. If you don‚Äôt want it, you will need to opt for the Old one. Hope this helps! If you learned something new, UPVOTE and SHARE to help us reach more readers.

A few negative voting campaigns have been tried with mixed success. We are all against train wrecks. But we repeatedly vote to watch them. Cesar Chavez led an anti-immigrant campaign in the 1960s and failed misetably. Nobody ordered a buger and said hold the lettuce including his vocal supporters. Kmart had a gun toting Charlies Angel PI as its spokesperson. Then it swtiched to an anti -gun spokesperson. The boycott by pro-gun people was quick and massive. KMart went into bankruptcy. Social Conservatives felt insulted by Starbucks, then by Target. Social liberals increased their Starbucks usage. Ackman tried to turn JC Penneys into an Abercrummy & Filth. JCP sales plummeted.

Should I decide my specialization during college or during graduate school? More specifically, what should I do to find my most interested area?","output":"You should choose you sub-specialty between 6 and 12 months into grad school. (US centric) The idea of choosing a 'specialization' within a discipline (here Math), is something that should be done in grad school. There are several reasons for this: 1) When applying to grad school you want an open mind and be willing to accept new ideas and interests.2) In undergrad you should use the time to explore as much as possible, both within your research interests and in general.3) Upon entering grad school you want to interview with professors (2 way interviews) to figure out where the best fit is, and this is NOT only research focussed - there are other factors such as personality fit and group size/culture, and so on.4) You want to use the first semester in grad school really getting a good fundamental knowledge base in you broad discipline (Math for the OP). Essentially, I strongly advise against being tied to a single interest area too early, where too early is definitely any time in undergrad. You want to go into grad school with an insatiable hunger for learning about the field broadly. On a personal level, I was completely detached from a specific interest when I entered grad school. I knew I liked Physics and Materials Science, and made sure I could switch departments at my chosen school if needed - and ended up in a Chemical engineering lab."},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"I‚Äôm a landlord and it all comes down to the market.

AngularJS (also known as Angular 1) is an open-source JavaScript framework that was released by Google in 2010. It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and allows developers to create dynamic, single-page applications. AngularJS uses two-way data binding, which means that changes made in the model are immediately reflected in the view and vice versa. It also provides directives, which are markers on the DOM that tell AngularJS to attach specific behavior to an element. On the other hand, Angular (also known as Angular 2+) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and was also released by Google in 2016. It is based on the Model-View-View Model (MVVM) architecture and allows developers to create complex, scalable applications. Angular uses a component-based approach, where each component has its own template, styling, and logic. It also uses one-way data binding, which means that changes made in the model are only reflected in the view, and not the other way around. Some other differences between AngularJS and Angular include: Language: AngularJS is written in JavaScript, while Angular is written in TypeScript.Performance: Angular is faster and more efficient than AngularJS, thanks to features like ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and lazy loading.Mobile support: Angular has better mobile support than AngularJS, with features like native mobile app development and responsive design.Dependency injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system, while AngularJS requires a separate library to achieve the same functionality. Overall, while both AngularJS and Angular are powerful web application development frameworks, Angular is more modern, efficient, and scalable, making it a better choice for complex, large-scale applications. If you want to start your career in Angular then I would recommend you to join[LINKED_TEXT: CETPA Infotech AngularJs course] [URL: https://www.cetpainfotech.com/technology/angularjs-training] and achieve your dream company like me.

That was around 1990 or so, i.e., LONG before he became President; not even a Presidential candidate! This \\"genius\\" attribute has been later confirmed when he came along as candidate. It is well known, a real genius seldom agrees with normal and dumb people. That's why MENSA has been created to help geniuses cope with their difficulties in life. Donald J Trump apparently meets all those expectations, including his difficulties to agree with Democrats and their supporters, who are mostly of lower IQs. Most low IQ people are not able to follow his quick and sharp way of thinking. That's why they call him being \\"incoherent\\". Having high IQ myself, I can follow his way of thinking; most of the time I can even ANTICIPATE what his response to a certain problem would be. It is also well known (you may consult with psychologists) that a person of some high IQ would easily estimate IQs of people lower than him/herself, but not the other way around. That's why most Dems say Trump has low IQ. They instead praised Obama of high IQ, which I donot agree at all ever since he was a Presidential candidate. There is neither logic nor reason in Obama's opinions. Obama's arguments did not arise from his logic or reason, but from his subjective hatred towards white people and Christians. Again, my estimate of Obama's IQ was later confirmed by Donald Trump, who said repeatedly, Obama is not smart at all!"},{"instruction":"w can I transfer ownership?","output":"When you are up for a[LINKED_TEXT: domain transfer] [URL: https://clients.temok.com/cart.php?a=add&domain=transfer] you‚Äôll need two things: a domain that‚Äôs still active, and an account on the platform where you want to transfer it to.

Rapid weight loss can have negative effects on your body and may not lead to long-term success. However, if you're looking to jumpstart your weight loss journey, here are some tips to help you lose weight more quickly: Reduce Caloric Intake: Create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body burns. This can be achieved by eating smaller portions, choosing lower-calorie foods, and avoiding high-calorie, processed snacks and sugary beverages.Focus on Whole Foods: Prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats. These foods can help you feel fuller for longer and provide essential nutrients.Mindful Eating: Pay attention to what you're eating and eat slowly. This can help you recognize when you're full and prevent overeating.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking.Limit Sugar and Processed Carbs: Minimize your intake of added sugars and refined carbohydrates, as they can contribute to weight gain. Choose complex carbs and whole grains instead.Increase Protein Intake: Protein can help you feel full and satisfied, and it also supports muscle maintenance. Include lean protein sources like chicken, fish, eggs, beans, and legumes in your meals.Regular Physical Activity: While exercise is not the primary focus here, staying active can help boost your metabolism and create a larger calorie deficit. Incorporate light activities like walking, taking the stairs, or doing household chores.Reduce Sodium Intake: High sodium intake can lead to water retention and bloating. Choose low-sodium options and avoid highly processed foods.Control Portion Sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes to prevent overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes visually.Intermittent Fasting: This eating pattern involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. It can help reduce calorie intake and promote weight loss, but it may not be suitable for everyone. Consult a healthcare professional before trying intermittent fasting.Get Enough Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can interfere with weight loss efforts by affecting hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism.Stress Management: Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga. Stress can contribute to overeating and weight gain.Consult a Professional: Before making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to ensure you're pursuing a safe and appropriate approach to weight loss. Remember, the goal is to create sustainable habits that you can maintain over time. Rapid weight loss may be motivating, but focusing on gradual, long-term changes is more likely to lead to lasting success.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"A proper answer to this question requires knowing WHAT COUNTRY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? In the United States, the very best universities are private, because the top tier of private schools are better funded than most public universities. These very top tier private schools can therefore can hire the best professors, have the best teacher-student ratios, and are better resourced all-around. However, none of these things are true when talking about the AVERAGE private university. However, there are countries that fund their public universities very well in comparison to the United States, where the opposite holds true. In Spain and Portugal, for instance, public universities are extremely well funded and they are tuition-free to the students. They are very competitive to get into to (wonder why?) and attract the best students and best professors as a result. The private universities are for the students who aren‚Äôt good enough to qualify for entrance to a public university (much like the lower tier of private schools in the USA)."},{"instruction":"lost my email password.

It takes some more time in some countries depending on the people, politicians and the history of the people of that country. US had a far better start in time as it gained independence in 1776. India got independence in 1947. But still, if you compare how these countries started their countries, India had better start as an independent country even though US had about 170 years headstart. All citizens of India are treated equally among law since its independence. Unlike US where citizens were slaves and others are slaveowners in the beginning. And its just not about corruption, people are easily fooled by their own leaders. There's never been an actual democracy in the world till now.
