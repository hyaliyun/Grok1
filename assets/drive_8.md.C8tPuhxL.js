HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2 to 4fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading generalpurpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).

According to the biographical notes, Fishburne never received any professional training as an actor. Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. Instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such highpowered roles, Fishburne's portrayal is focused more on Othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. In a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by Fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been.

The 25-year-old centre-back missed Swansea's opening match of the season against Manchester United due to visa issues, but is now available for selection.

Limbering up and adopting a deep stance not only help prevent injury but also improve your performance. Limbering Up Limbering up refers to a set of exercises or movements that aim to loosen up the muscles, increase blood flow, and prepare the body for physical exertion. This can include stretching, dynamic movements, and breathing exercises. Limbering up can help increase flexibility, reduce muscle tension, and improve range of motion. It is essential to start your exercise or sports routine with some gentle warm-up exercises to prevent injury and prepare your muscles and joints for more intense activity. Adopting a Deep Stance Adopting a deep stance means maintaining a proper posture when performing physical activities. It refers to a position where feet are shoulder-width apart, knees are bent, and hips are pushed back. This stance helps engage the core muscles, protect the lower back, and improve balance and stability. In sports, adopting a deep stance is essential, especially in basketball, volleyball, and tennis, where maintaining balance and mobility are critical. Why is it Important? Proper warm-up and good posture are both essential for preventing injuries and improving performance. Limbering up can help reduce the risk of muscle strains, sprains, and other injuries that may occur during exercise or sports activities. Adopting a deep stance can improve your balance, reduce the risk of falls, and prevent lower back pain. It can also help you generate more power with your movements and increase endurance. In conclusion, before engaging in any physical activity, it is essential to warm up properly and adopt a deep stance. Limbering up prepares your body for physical activity, while adopting a deep stance helps maintain proper posture and improve performance.

This means that a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current. If the applied voltage exceeds the LED's forward voltage drop by a small amount, the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount, potentially damaging or destroying the LED. The typical solution is to use constantcurrent power supplies to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating. Since most common power sources (batteries, mains) are constantvoltage sources, most LED fixtures must include a power converter, at least a currentlimiting resistor. However, the high resistance of threevolt coin cells combined with the high differential resistance of nitridebased LEDs makes it possible to power such an LED from such a coin cell without an external resistor.

It is not uncommon to find pandas sleeping in trees, as it provides them with a sense of security and privacy, away from the noisy crowds.

Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur. Early red LEDs were notable for their short service life. With the development of highpower LEDs the devices are subjected to higher junction temperatures and higher current densities than traditional devices.

He scored two touchdowns in the game, both of them showing his skill and athleticism on the field. Many viewers were curious about how much longer his second touchdown run was compared to his first one.

Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II) literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech.

This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.

However, embracing vulnerability can help us grow and become more resilient. Here are five steps to help you find your vulnerability and strengthen your ability to cope with difficult situations. 1. Identify Your Vulnerabilities: It can be difficult to identify the things that make us vulnerable to emotional pain. However, taking the time to reflect on your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can help you recognize triggers that leave you feeling exposed. 2. Take Small Steps: Exposing yourself to situations that make you feel vulnerable can be daunting. However, taking small steps to gradually expose yourself can help you build the confidence to face challenges head-on. 3. Have a Forgetting Ritual: Dwelling on negative experiences and emotions can be draining. Instead, develop a forgetting ritual - a physical or mental action that represents letting go of difficult experiences and moving on. 4. Put Less Stock in What Others Think: We often rely on external validation to feel secure, which can leave us feeling vulnerable to others' opinions. However, recognizing that we cannot control what others think can help us focus on our own internal values and beliefs. 5. Distract Yourself from Hard Feelings: When we feel vulnerable or exposed, it's easy to get caught up in negative emotions. Instead, focus your attention on something else - whether it's a hobby, exercise, or spending time with loved ones. In conclusion, embracing our vulnerabilities can be a powerful tool for growth and resilience. By identifying our triggers, taking small steps, embracing forgetting rituals, putting less stock in what others think, and distracting ourselves from hard feelings, we can build our capacity to cope with whatever comes our way."},{"instruction":"The breakfast buffet used to be very good, but both the size and quality have diminished over recent years.

Our hands come into contact with a lot of germs and bacteria throughout the day, and when we touch our face, we introduce those germs and bacteria to our nose, mouth, and eyes. This can lead to illnesses, infections, and even exacerbate existing health conditions. To reduce the likelihood of contracting illnesses, it's important to avoid touching your face as much as possible. This can be a lot harder than it sounds, as many of us touch our faces without even realizing it. However, with some conscious effort, you can minimize the number of times you touch your face throughout the day. One way to avoid touching your face is to keep your hands busy. Fidget toys, stress balls, or simply holding a pen or pencil can give your hands something to do, reducing your urge to touch your face. Additionally, practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly and avoiding touching surfaces in public places, can also help reduce your risk of infection. Another way to curb the habit of touching your face is to practice mindfulness techniques. Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and being aware of your thoughts and actions. By staying present and aware, you can catch yourself before you touch your face and redirect your hands to other activities. In conclusion, while it may seem like a difficult habit to break, avoiding touching your face is essential to your overall health and well-being. By practicing good hygiene, keeping your hands busy, and staying present in the moment, you can reduce your risk of illness and promote a healthier lifestyle. Remember, not touching your face is a small action that can have a big impact on your health."},{"instruction":"Life as i know it is relatively enjoyable .

Try a pencil eraser. Use toothpaste.","output":"When it comes to removing stains, there are numerous methods that you can try. However, some of them may be more effective than others. If you are dealing with a tough stain, it's always best to start with the basics. Here are three simple ways to remove a stain: 1. Wipe the Stain with a Clean, Damp Cloth This is the first and most basic step to try when tackling a stain. It's important to act fast and remove as much of the stain as possible before it sets in. Start by blotting the stain gently with a clean, damp cloth. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can cause it to spread or set in deeper. Repeat the process until the stain is no longer visible. 2. Try a Pencil Eraser If wiping the stain with a damp cloth doesn't work, try using a pencil eraser. This trick works well for small stains, such as ink or food stains on clothing. Simply rub the eraser over the stain gently until it starts to lift. Be sure to use a clean eraser, and avoid applying too much pressure, as this can damage the fabric. 3. Use Toothpaste Toothpaste isn't just for cleaning teeth. It can also be used to remove stubborn stains. This method works best for stains on hard surfaces, such as countertops or walls. Squeeze a small amount of toothpaste onto the stain and rub it in gently with a damp cloth. Let the toothpaste sit for a few minutes, then wipe it away with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat the process until the stain is gone. In conclusion, removing stains can be a tedious and frustrating process. However, by using these simple methods, you can easily tackle stains and keep your clothes and surfaces looking clean and fresh. Don't be afraid to experiment with different methods until you find the right one for your particular stain."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: James Wilkinson, Ms. Rice's communications director, was shoved against a wall by guards as he tried to enter the meeting.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"At least 19 dead bodies were found in northern Mexico near the US border, and it is believed that they were Central and South American migrants who were crossing the country. Brazilian authorities confirmed that at least four Brazilians were among the dead. The discovery was made on November 20th, 2019, in the municipality of Camargo in Tamaulipas, a state known for its violence and drug trafficking. Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, stated on his Twitter profile that the situation is a result of the Mexican government's weak stance on the drug cartels, which is leading to criminal organizations controlling the migrant routes and extorting money from the migrants. Mr. Calderon blames the current government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for not acting fast and thoroughly to uproot cartel activity throughout the country. According to the state prosecutor's office, three suspects and a member of the Mexican military were killed in a shootout that began when patrol officers found a truck that was believed to be holding the migrants. The perpetrators of this heinous act dumped the dead bodies in a remote area to avoid detection, and it is yet unknown who they were and what their intentions were. The migration of people from Central and South America to the US via Mexico has been on the rise in recent years, and many of them have fallen victim to the oppression of cartels that exert control over the routes. The current situation leaves people in despair, with no other options but to risk their lives in hopes of a better future. This tragedy calls for a systematic and prompt response from the Mexican government to uproot the cartels' activities and secure the country's borders, enabling people to migrate safely and legally. The Mexican government must take steps to alleviate the plight of these migrants and work with other countries in the region to address the underlying causes of migration, providing better economic opportunities and fighting against corruption and criminal activity."},{"instruction":"Next question: when is the world cup going to end?","output":"The current World Cup is not ongoing, the next World Cup is scheduled to be held from November 21 to December 18, 2022."},{"instruction":"hasabuiltinrechargeablebatterypackwithanoperatingtimeofapproximately12hoursandalsocomeswithaSubconnconnectorforattachingacamera.

In 1976, the Lebanese Civil War was raging on, and the Syrian government, led by President Hafez al-Assad, decided to intervene on behalf of the Lebanese Christian factions that were fighting against the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and its allies. The Syrian troops helped stabilize the situation in the country and provided support for the Christian militias, effectively turning the tide of the war against the PLO. However, this intervention was not without controversy, as it violated the sovereignty of Lebanon and caused tensions between the two countries. In 1982, a few years after the Syrian intervention, a cease-fire agreement was reached between the warring parties in Lebanon, following the invasion of the country by Israeli forces. The agreement was brokered by the United States and called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon and the implementation of a multinational force to monitor the situation. While the cease-fire agreement was a significant milestone in ending the conflict in Lebanon, it came after the Syrian intervention, which had already played a crucial role in changing the course of the war. The events that led to these two milestones were complex and intertwined, and their impact on Lebanon and the region as a whole remains a topic of debate and analysis. In conclusion, Hal al-Assad sending troops into Lebanon happened before the cease-fire agreement.

In order to calculate this difference, one must first identify the lengths of the longest and shortest touchdown plays. Let's assume that we are analyzing a single game and have access to the full play-by-play data. We can start by scanning through each touchdown play to identify the length of the play in yards. Once we have identified the length of the longest and shortest touchdown plays, we can simply subtract the length of the shortest touchdown from the length of the longest touchdown to determine the difference in yards. For example, let's say that in a particular game the longest touchdown was a 75-yard pass and the shortest touchdown was a 1-yard run. To calculate the difference in yardage between these two plays, we would subtract 1 from 75 to get a total difference of 74 yards. This information can be useful in a number of ways, including analyzing the overall offensive performance of the teams, identifying which types of plays are more effective in certain situations (such as long passes or short runs near the goal line), and determining which plays had the greatest impact on the outcome of the game. In conclusion, the difference in yardage between the longest and shortest touchdowns scored in a football game provides valuable insight into the dynamics and intensity of the game. By calculating this difference, analysts and fans alike can gain a deeper understanding of the key moments and turning points in the game."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"negative"},{"instruction":"ere is some data: Midsummer House eatType restaurant; Midsummer House food Fast food; Midsummer House priceRange moderate; Midsummer House customer rating 3 out of 5; Midsummer House near All Bar One.

With the right equipment and techniques, players can survive and thrive in this virtual world. In this article, we will focus on how to defend against mobs using a bow. Step 1: Obtain a bow The first step in defending against mobs with a bow is to obtain one. Bows can be crafted by using string and sticks, or they can be obtained from various sources, such as trading with villagers or looting in dungeons. Step 2: Keep your distance When facing mobs, it is important to keep your distance. Bows are best used from a distance, as they allow the player to attack without risking close combat. This is particularly helpful when dealing with mobs that can deal significant damage, such as zombies or skeletons. Step 3: Shoot it three times When attacking mobs with a bow, it is essential to aim and shoot accurately. Mobs can move quickly, making it challenging to hit them with just one shot. Aiming for the head can deal more damage, and aiming for the legs or feet can slow down the mob. Shoot each mob three times to take them down. Step 4: Build a dirt tower If there are multiple mobs attacking, it is advisable to build a dirt tower. This will allow the player to retreat to a vantage point and attack the mobs from a higher position. Dirt is easy to obtain and can be crafted into blocks quickly. Step 5: Create arrow holes or a roof post When retreating to a dirt tower, it's best to create some arrow holes to attack the mobs while remaining safe. Additionally, creating a roof post can provide cover against mobs that can attack from the air, such as phantoms. Step 6: Enchant your bow Finally, it's essential to enchant your bow. Enchantments can improve the bow's accuracy and inflict more damage on the mobs. Enchantments can be achieved through enchanting tables, librarians, or enchanting books. In conclusion, using a bow to defend against mobs in Minecraft requires careful planning and effective execution. By following these steps, players can gain an advantage against various mobs and increase their chances of survival in this virtual world."},{"instruction":"Please add punctuation to this: Hotel Zagreb Pore Location Driving directio","output":"Hotel Zagreb Poreč.

Others offer more conservative estimates, citing only a handful of towns, such as Lares, Adjuntas, and San Germán. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the exact number of rebellious towns, historians generally agree that the events of 1704 were significant in challenging Spanish authority in the region. The uprising highlighted the discontent of the colonists with their treatment at the hands of the Spanish government, and it played a role in sparking further rebellions in the following years.
