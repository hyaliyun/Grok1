To turn off the swap file, type this command into the Terminal window: To reactivate the swap, Type this command in the terminal window:","output":"The Terminal program is a powerful tool for users who want to interact with their computer's operating system directly. One of the things that users can do with Terminal is to modify how their computer uses memory, specifically with regard to the \\"swap file.\\" The swap file is a piece of the operating system that helps to manage which data is currently stored in memory (RAM) and which data is stored on the hard drive. When a computer runs out of available memory, it can use the swap file to temporarily store data that isn't currently being used. This can help to prevent crashes and other problems that occur when a computer runs out of memory. However, there may be times when a user wants to turn off the swap file, either because they have enough memory available or because they want to conserve resources. To do this, they can use the Terminal program and type in the necessary command. The command is simply: \`\`\` sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist \`\`\` This command will tell the computer to stop using the swap file until it is reactivated. It's important to note that this command requires admin privileges, so the user will have to enter their password to execute it. When the user wants to turn the swap file back on, they can do so by typing in another command in the Terminal window. The command is: \`\`\` sudo launchctl load -wF /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist \`\`\` This command will tell the computer to load the dynamic pager, which is the component responsible for managing the swap file.

Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected.

The reports suggest that the French President had an affair with Julie Gayet, a 42-year-old actress who has kept a low profile ever since the affair was made public. The rumours about Hollande's alleged affair with Gayet first emerged in January 2014, when French magazine Closer published pictures of the President arriving at Gayet's apartment on a scooter. The pictures sparked a media storm and brought the private lives of French politicians into the public eye. Since then, both Hollande and Gayet have mostly kept out of the press, with the French President rarely making any public comments about his private life. However, the rumours have refused to die down, and now the latest reports suggest that there may be some truth to the allegations. While it remains unclear whether or not Hollande did in fact have an affair with Gayet, the reports have once again drawn attention to the private lives of public figures. Many have questioned whether it is appropriate for the media to intrude on the private lives of politicians, and whether or not such rumours have any place in political discourse.

Measuring the water vapor in the air is not something that can be done with household items. This is the point at which the air would be saturated with moisture and is called the saturation mixing ratio. The amount of water vapor the air can hold is dependent upon the temperature of the air. Tables are available online that will tell you the capacity of water vapor at a specific temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the water vapor capacity. To determine how much water vapor the air can hold at a certain temperature, reference the table at https://brownell.co.uk/datasheets/basics_humidity.pdf.

To ensure that your tablets remain effective, potent, and safe for consumption, it's essential to store them properly. Here are some tips to assist you in correctly storing your medicines and supplements. Firstly, avoid storing your medications in the bathroom cabinet. The humid environment can make your medication less effective and may lead to spoilage. In addition, exposure to fluctuating temperatures and moisture can significantly affect the quality and reliability of the tablets. Moreover, don't keep your supplements near the oven or sink. The warm temperature and humidity of the kitchen can break down the active ingredients in your medication, leading to a reduction in its effectiveness. Similarly, exposing your supplements to moisture may cause them to dissolve or alter their texture. Consider storing your vitamins and supplements in the bedroom, where the environment is dry, cool, and dark. Keeping them in a nearby bedside table can help you stay on track with your medication routine and make it easier to remember to take them. Lastly, use airtight containers for storing pills and tablets. This helps protect them from contact with moisture, air, and light, which can degrade the quality of the medication. By using a well-sealed container, you can extend the shelf life of the tablets while ensuring their potency and safety. In conclusion, proper medication storage is crucial for the safety and effectiveness of your medication regimen. Avoid storing your medication in humid and warm environments such as the bathroom and kitchen, consider storing them in your bedroom, and always use airtight containers for maximum quality and freshness.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. In terms of the newline, Unicode introduced U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR and U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.

In doing so, Unicode does provide a way around the historical platform dependent solutions.

However, it's important to remember that setbacks are a natural part of the human experience, and it's never too late to take steps towards getting back on track. The first step towards moving forward is to realize that it's possible. It can be easy to feel stuck or lost, but it's important to maintain a growth mentality and know that change is possible. This shift in mindset can set the tone for the rest of the process. Next, it's important to examine our thoughts. Are we stuck in negative thought patterns or limiting beliefs? Taking time to reflect on our thoughts and beliefs can be a powerful tool for change. Consider seeking out resources like therapy or self-help books to help shift negative self-talk. Once our thoughts are in check, it's time to reflect on our behaviors. Are we engaging in actions that are furthering our goals, or are we sabotaging ourselves in some way? If we're struggling to adopt new habits, consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps. We can also seek accountability from friends or family members to help us stay on track. Finally, it's important to be kind to ourselves throughout the process. It can be easy to beat ourselves up for past mistakes or slip-ups, but this self-criticism can be counterproductive. Instead, try to adopt a mindset of self-compassion and understand that setbacks are a natural part of the journey. Celebrate small wins along the way, and look for opportunities to practice forgiveness and gratitude. In conclusion, getting back on track is a process that takes time and effort, but it's always possible.

The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the top and bottom of each side of each segment. The parapodia (limbs) of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips – for example jointed, comblike or hooked. Chetae are made of moderately flexible βchitin and are formed by follicles, each of which has a chetoblast (hairforming) cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta. The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli, fine hairlike extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta. When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta. Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae (bristles) of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid αchitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle.

Keep a water bottle nearby and sip on it throughout the day. Finally, don't hesitate to use over-the-counter pain medications for any discomfort or pain associated with breastfeeding. Brands like ibuprofen are safe and effective in reducing inflammation and alleviating pain. However, always consult with your doctor before taking any medication.

Nepenthes attenboroughii is named after nature presenter Sir David Attenborough. Pitcher plants can capture mice and rats and then digest them. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Botanists have recently found what is believed to be one of the largest carnivorous plants in the world, and it has been named after famous nature presenter Sir David Attenborough. The plant, called Nepenthes attenboroughii, belongs to a group also known as pitcher plants. These plants are notorious for their ability to trap and digest insects and small animals, including mice and rats. This new Nepenthes attenboroughii species was discovered in the remote rainforests of the Philippines, on the island of Palawan. It was first spotted and collected by a group of botanists from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. They were amazed by the size of the plant's pitchers, which can reach up to 35 cm in length and 15 cm in width. These pitchers are filled with nectar and digestive enzymes, and they function as a deadly trap for unsuspecting prey. Interestingly, Nepenthes attenboroughii is not the only large pitcher plant species found in the Philippines. The country is known to harbor a high diversity of these plants, including other giant species like Nepenthes truncata and Nepenthes maxima. However, the discovery of Nepenthes attenboroughii is particularly exciting because it confirms that there are still new and amazing species waiting to be found in even the most well-explored regions of the world. Sir David Attenborough, for whom the plant is named, is a renowned naturalist and broadcaster who has spent decades documenting the wonders of the natural world. He has long been an advocate for species conservation and biodiversity awareness, and his name is a fitting tribute to this incredible plant. With this discovery, Nepenthes attenboroughii joins a long list of amazing and unique organisms that make our planet such a special place."},{"instruction":"dentify the most salient words in this sentence: adherents pray outside a mosque on friday .","output":"adherents, pray, outside, mosque, Friday."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: Somebody Stole My Gal, was the theme tune of which band leader?","output":"Johnnie Ray"},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

Over the years, Macau flourished as a center for trade and commerce, but it was not without its challenges. In the mid-17th century, the Dutch attempted to capture Macau through a military assault, but the Portuguese successfully repelled their attack. Despite this successful defense, the Portuguese ultimately decided to leave Macau for several reasons. One reason for the Portuguese departure was that Macau was becoming increasingly isolated. As neighboring regions such as Guangzhou developed into major trade hubs, Macau began to lose its strategic importance. Additionally, the Portuguese faced competition from the British, who were asserting themselves as a dominant force in the region. This competition further weakened the Portuguese position in Macau. Another factor that contributed to the Portuguese departure was financial pressure. The costs of maintaining a colonial presence in Macau were significant, and it was unclear whether the benefits of retaining the port were worth the expense. As a result, the Portuguese administration began to view Macau as an economic burden, rather than an asset. Finally, the Portuguese were also dealing with internal political turmoil. In the first half of the 19th century, Portugal underwent significant changes, including the Napoleonic invasion, the loss of Brazil, and political instability. These events distracted the Portuguese from their colonial possessions, and Macau was a casualty of this neglect. Despite the successful defense against the Dutch, the Portuguese ultimately decided to abandon Macau in 1999, when they handed the territory over to China. This move was a result of negotiations that had begun in the early 1980s, and it marked the end of Portugal's presence in the region. In conclusion, the decision to leave Macau was a complex one that was influenced by a range of factors. While the successful defense against the Dutch was a significant achievement, it was not enough to protect Macau from economic and political pressures that ultimately led to its abandonment."},{"instruction":"What is the most corrosive substance?

However, in some situations it is desirable to move, migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different total costs of ownership or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (onetime) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically a DBMS vendor provides tools to help importing databases from other popular DBMSs. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return unanswerable): What kind of database is migration impossible from?","output":"unanswerable"},{"instruction":"During the 1920s and 1930s, British civil servants and politicians, looking back at the performance of the state during World War I, concluded that there was a need for greater coordination between the three Services that made up the armed forces of the United Kingdom—the British Army, the Royal Navy, and the Royal Air Force. The formation of a united ministry of defence was rejected by David Lloyd George's coalition government in 1921; but the Chiefs of Staff Committee was formed in 1923, for the purposes of interService coordination.

Plunkett was the quarterback for the Oakland Raiders at the time, and during a game against the Washington Redskins, he threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver, Cliff Branch. This play was not only a record-breaking moment, but it was also the turning point in the game, ultimately leading to a win for the Raiders. Since then, a few other quarterbacks have come close to breaking Plunkett's record. In 2004, Brett Favre threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver, Robert Ferguson, during a game against the Chicago Bears. However, this play was called back due to a penalty. Five years later, in 2009, Tennessee Titans quarterback, Vince Young, threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver, Kenny Britt, during a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. However, this play was not quite enough to break Plunkett's record since it was only a few yards shorter. Even though it's been nearly four decades since Jim Plunkett set this record, nobody has been able to surpass his remarkable achievement. It's a testament to both his ability as a quarterback and the connection he had with his wide receiver, Cliff Branch. While many have tried and come close, nobody has been able to go the full 100 yards to score a touchdown."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Nick Clegg follows David Cameron by donning traditional Indian dress.

During his visit, Clegg met with Indian officials and business leaders to discuss opportunities for increased trade and investment. He also highlighted the importance of the UK's strong cultural ties with India, noting that over 1.5 million people of Indian origin currently live in the UK.

The father and son duo had been accused of exploiting five women for money but were cleared of sex trafficking charges in court on Wednesday. The charges against the Georges stem from a long-standing investigation into their alleged involvement in sex trafficking and prostitution in New York City. The prosecutors alleged that the father and son duo had forced women into prostitution, taking the majority of the profits earned by the women. The women were also subject to physical abuse and threats of violence if they did not comply with the Georges' demands. Despite being cleared of sex trafficking charges, the Georges still face up to 15 years in prison for money laundering and promoting prostitution. While the verdict will undoubtedly come as a disappointment to the accused, it represents a significant win for prosecutors who have long been battling against the proliferation of sex trafficking in the city. The case highlights the insidious nature of sex trafficking and the need for continued vigilance in combatting this horrific crime. While many people may not think of New York City as a hub for such activities, the city is, unfortunately, a hotbed for sex trafficking and prostitution. As the investigation into the Georges' activities has shown, this is not an issue that can be easily resolved. It requires the concerted efforts of law enforcement, non-profit organizations, and community members alike to raise awareness, offer support and assistance to victims. The verdict in the Georges' trial is a step in the right direction but there is still much work to be done. By working together, we can ensure that victims of sex trafficking receive the justice and support they deserve, and we can help to eradicate this abhorrent crime from our streets."},{"instruction":"Write a title: European antitrust regulators extend their review of MicrosoftTime Warner deal.

Bronson asked Kray to help him sell several of his paintings with the aim of raising enough money to send his mother on holiday. Eira, 85, will be the recipient of the gesture, which Bronson considers an apology. Bronson, a Tottenham Hotspur fan, has reportedly been incensed by rival team Arsenal's recent success in the FA Cup. This anger seems to have boiled over, causing him to go on a rampage. In a bizarre turn of events, Bronson allegedly covered himself in Lurpack butter before attacking twelve staff members at his prison. Despite his violent tendencies, Bronson's artwork has been described as \\"a peek into the mind of an intelligent man with issues.\\" It is expected that the paintings will fetch around £5,000, which will be used to pay for Eira's holiday. Bronson's criminal history and violent behavior have made him a notorious figure both in and out of prison.

The EU is headquartered in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, and its various institutions and bodies require an enormous amount of paperwork. The EU is responsible for legislating on a wide range of areas, from agriculture to trade to climate change, and this requires a vast amount of documentation. From policy proposals to impact assessments to meeting minutes, the EU generates an enormous quantity of paper. In addition, the EU's administrative processes, such as recruitment and procurement, also generate significant amounts of paperwork. The impact of this on Belgium's paper consumption is significant. According to Eurostat, in 2019 Belgium used 490 kilograms of paper per capita, compared to an EU average of 165 kilograms per capita. This makes Belgium the country with the highest paper consumption per person in the world. Of course, the EU's bureaucracy is not the only factor contributing to Belgium's high paper consumption. Belgium is also home to many other international institutions, such as NATO and various UN agencies, which generate their own paperwork. However, the sheer volume of paperwork generated by the EU is undoubtedly a major factor. There are, of course, efforts underway to reduce the amount of paper used by the EU. In recent years, there has been a push towards digitalization, with more and more documents being made available online. However, this process is slow and there are a number of obstacles to overcome. Overall, while Belgium's position as the world's biggest paper consumer is largely due to the EU's bureaucracy, it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, it is clear that reducing paper consumption should be a priority for all organizations, including the EU, if we are to tackle the environmental challenges facing our planet."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: lord shiva wrote song for which poet name??","output":"There is no historical record of Lord Shiva writing songs for any particular poet.

Outgoing director general Mark Thompson rejects statue idea as Orwell was 'too leftwing'","output":"Iconic author George Orwell, known for his works Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, worked as a political journalist for the BBC during World War Two. As a writer, Orwell was known for his strong political opinions and his commitment to social justice. Recently, there has been talk of erecting a statue of Orwell outside the BBC's headquarters to commemorate his contributions to the organization during the war. However, outgoing director general Mark Thompson has rejected the idea, citing Orwell's left-wing political views as the reason. While it is true that Orwell was a socialist and a critic of many aspects of British society, it seems short-sighted to reject the idea of commemorating him based solely on his political views. Orwell's work as a journalist for the BBC during the war was crucial in providing accurate and insightful reporting on the conflict to the British people. Moreover, Orwell's legacy as a writer and advocate for freedom of speech and individual rights has inspired generations of readers and continues to influence political discourse around the world. Erecting a statue of Orwell would not only recognize his contributions to British journalism, but also serve as a reminder of the importance of a free and independent press in a democratic society. In the end, it is disappointing to see that political considerations are preventing the recognition of a truly great writer and journalist. However, Orwell's legacy will continue to endure regardless of whether or not a statue is ever erected in his honor."},{"instruction":"You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil, but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of 37 °C. Although the blood will not boil, the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures, known as ebullism, is still a concern. The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture.

He spent most of his time with the San Diego Chargers, where he set numerous franchise records. One of the most impressive things about Kaeding's career was his consistency. He was known for making the vast majority of his field goals, regardless of the distance. But how much variance was there in the distances of his successful kicks? Specifically, what was the difference between Kaeding's longest and shortest field goals? To answer this question, let's start with Kaeding's longest field goal. That came during his rookie season in 2004, when he drilled a 54-yarder against the New York Jets. That kick tied the Chargers' franchise record for longest field goal, and it remained Kaeding's career high for the next six years. As for Kaeding's shortest field goal, that came during his final season in the NFL. In 2012, he was playing for the Miami Dolphins and made a 20-yard field goal against the St. Louis Rams. So, what's the difference between those two kicks? 54 - 20 = 34 The answer is that there is a 34-yard difference between Nate Kaeding's longest and shortest field goals. That's a pretty significant range, especially for a kicker known for his consistency. But it's also worth noting that Kaeding's career average for field goal distance was 36.5 yards, so the gap between his longest and shortest kicks wasn't actually that big compared to many other kickers in the league. Overall, while there was certainly some variance in the distances of Nate Kaeding's successful field goals, he was generally a very reliable kicker from any distance. Whether he was attempting a 20-yard chip shot or a 54-yard bomb, Kaeding had the skills and composure to make the kick more often than not."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: For instance by payment of a lifetime even if you live longer than average or by paid to the survivor on death GNU FDL Source Wikipedia Read more","output":"\\"For instance, by payment of a lifetime, even if you live longer than average, or by paid to the survivor on death.

Sometimes, after years of teaching, it's easy to fall into patterns and routines that lose the spark and enthusiasm that you once had. One way to reignite that passion is by attending seminars and workshops that provide new ideas, techniques, and strategies. Another way to rejuvenate your passion for teaching is by talking to past students. Often, hearing about the impact that you had on students' lives can reignite your sense of purpose and remind you of why you became a teacher in the first place. These conversations can also provide valuable insights into what worked well in your teaching and areas that could be improved. In addition to attending seminars and talking to past students, it's also essential to take care of your well-being. Teaching can be a stressful profession, and it's easy to get overwhelmed by the workload and pressure. To reduce stress, you need to find ways to relax and recharge. This could be anything from meditation and yoga to spending time with family and friends or engaging in hobbies that you enjoy. When dealing with challenging students or situations in the classroom, it's important not to take things personally. Remember that every student is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. Instead, focus on what you enjoy about teaching and the positive impact that you can have on your students' lives. Lastly, it's important to talk to someone about your frustrations. Whether it's a colleague, mentor, or loved one, having someone to confide in can be a tremendous help in dealing with the challenges of teaching. They may be able to offer advice, a listening ear, or simply be a sounding board for your thoughts and feelings. In summary, attending seminars and workshops, talking to past students, taking care of your well-being, not taking things personally, focusing on the positives, and talking to someone about your frustrations are all effective ways to regain your passion for teaching. By incorporating these strategies into your routine, you can find new and engaging ways to inspire and connect with your students, ultimately making a positive impact on their lives."},{"instruction":"Tokyo #39;s Nikkei average rose for the first time in three sessions to close 0.62 percent higher on Wednesday after investors found positive signs in revised Japanese economic growth figures that were sluggish overall.

Stir it gently to prevent the strands from clumping together. Step 5: Cook the spaghetti for 8 to 10 minutes or until it's al dente. Keep an eye on the pot to avoid overcooking the spaghetti. Step 6: Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it using a colander. Don't rinse the pasta with cold water as it can remove the starches that help the sauce adhere to the pasta.
