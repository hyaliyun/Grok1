SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems.

In the extensive list of knowledge statements provided earlier, there wasn't a specific mention of complexation reactions and chelation. These topics are typically relevant to discussions involving coordination chemistry, which is a subset of inorganic chemistry that explores the structure and properties of complex metal ions with ligands. Considering the AP Chemistry curriculum, topics such as complexation reactions and chelation might not be as deeply covered or emphasized unless they are specifically related to understanding solubility through complex ion equilibria or other relevant concepts. For the AP Chemistry exam and the specific knowledge statements you've provided, a focus on solubility equilibria, especially with regards to the solubility product constant (Ksp) and the common-ion effect, is pertinent. Complexation reactions might only be relevant if they're tied to topics like solubility, but they wouldn't be a main focus. Thus, in the context of AP Chemistry and the mentioned knowledge statements, you can focus less on complexation reactions and chelation unless they directly relate to the principles being tested."},{"instruction":"Como e por que desabilitar os processos em segundo plano e desabilitar a escala de animação da janela e outras animações pelas opções do desenvolvedor pode afetar positivamente o Android","output":"Desabilitar processos em segundo plano e ajustar as opções de animação no Android podem ter efeitos benéficos no desempenho do dispositivo e na vida útil da bateria, especialmente em aparelhos mais antigos ou com especificações de hardware mais modestas. Aqui está o porquê dessas ações serem potencialmente vantajosas: # Desabilitando processos em segundo plano Por padrão, o Android permite que aplicativos executem processos em segundo plano para realizar tarefas mesmo quando não estão em uso ativo. Esses processos podem incluir sincronização de dados, atualizações de conteúdo e outras atividades de manutenção. No entanto, esses processos podem consumir recursos do sistema, como CPU e memória RAM, além de drenar a bateria, causando os seguintes efeitos: 1. **Melhoria de desempenho:** Desativando ou limitando processos em segundo plano, você reduz a carga sobre os recursos do sistema. Isso pode resultar em uma experiência de usuário mais rápida e responsiva, principalmente em dispositivos com hardware limitado. 2. **Aumento da vida útil da bateria:** Menos processos em funcionamento significam menos uso de energia, o que pode prolongar a duração da bateria do seu dispositivo. 3. **Menor aquecimento:** Processos em segundo plano podem levar a um aumento na temperatura do dispositivo. Reduzi-los pode ajudar a manter seu telefone mais frio. # Desabilitando a escala de animação da janela e outras animações O Android utiliza animações para transições entre telas, abertura e fechamento de aplicativos, e outras interações da interface do usuário. Estas animações proporcionam uma experiência visual mais suave e agradável para o usuário, mas também requerem processamento adicional que pode impactar o desempenho do telefone. Ajustando ou desabilitando animações, você pode observar os seguintes benefícios: 1. **Interface mais ágil:** Com animações reduzidas ou desativadas, a interface do usuário pode parecer mais rápida porque a transição entre atividades e tarefas ocorre quase instantaneamente sem os atrasos adicionais das animações. 2. **Menor uso de CPU e GPU:** Executar animações exige de ambos, a CPU e a GPU do dispositivo. Desabilitá-las pode liberar esses recursos para outros processos mais críticos. 3. **Economia de bateria:** Como com a desativação de processos em segundo plano, reduzir as animações pode resultar em economia de energia e aumentar a longevidade da bateria, já que a GPU consome menos energia. # Como desabilitá-los: Para desabilitar processos em segundo plano ou ajustar as opções de animação no Android, você precisa ativar as Opções de desenvolvedor seguindo estas etapas: 1. Vá até as Configurações do dispositivo (Settings). 2. Desça até Sobre o telefone (About phone). 3. Toque várias vezes no número da versão do build até que seja informado que as Opções de desenvolvedor estão ativadas. 4. Retorne ao menu de Configurações e você encontrará as Opções de desenvolvedor. 5. Dentro das Opções de desenvolvedor, você pode limitar os processos em segundo plano e ajustar as escalas de animação. Lembre-se que fazer esses ajustes pode ter consequências indesejadas, como aplicativos que não atualizam em segundo plano ou uma experiência de usuário que pode parecer menos fluida. Portanto, ao ajustar essas configurações, faça-o com cautela e esteja ciente de como essas mudanças podem afetar o uso diário do seu dispositivo Android."},{"instruction":"O Que é responsivo","output":"\\"Responsivo\\" é um termo que, no contexto da tecnologia e design web, refere-se à capacidade de um site ou aplicação de se adaptar automaticamente ao tamanho da tela do dispositivo que o está acessando. Isso significa que um site responsivo deve parecer bom e ser funcional tanto em uma tela de desktop grande quanto em uma tela de smartphone pequena ou em qualquer dispositivo intermediário, como tablets. Para alcançar a responsividade, designers e desenvolvedores web utilizam uma combinação de layouts flexíveis, imagens e uma estratégia de design chamada \\"mobile-first\\", na qual o site é projetado para telas móveis primeiro e então adaptado para telas maiores. Eles também implementam media queries no CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), que permitem que o site mude sua aparência com base nas características do dispositivo, como a largura da tela ou a resolução. Essa prática tornou-se uma parte essencial da criação de sites devido ao aumento do uso de dispositivos móveis para acessar a internet. Sem responsividade, os usuários encontrariam dificuldade em navegar pelos sites, teriam que fazer zoom para ler o texto ou interagir com os elementos da página, o que poderia levar a uma experiência de usuário frustrante e afetar negativamente a reputação do site ou aplicação. Portanto, um design responsivo ajuda a garantir que todos os usuários tenham uma experiência de navegação positiva, independentemente do dispositivo que estejam usando."},{"instruction":"Write a GoT version of Fast and Furious with Horses, with in character dialogue.","output":"Title: Hooves and Honor Scene: The vast, open plains of the Dothraki Sea. We see a Khalasar of horse-mounted warriors, led by a fierce and renowned Khal named Drago. They ride like the wind, their horses' hooves thundering on the ground. A large convoy of various Westerosi and Essos nobles, recognizable by their banners, ride on finely bred horses. They are led by an exiled knight, Ser Rodrik \\"the Rapid,\\" famous for being the quickest rider in the Seven Kingdoms. Khal Drago: (Shouting in Dothraki) \\"Today we ride with the fury of the great stallion! None can match the speed of our hooves!\\" Ser Rodrik \\"the Rapid,\\" smirking: \\"You have not yet seen Westerosi steel fly on four legs, Khal. I'm ready to put your dothraki pride to the test.\\" The group rides to an open field fashioned into a makeshift race course, marked by banners and small fires. Riders from all over Essos and Westeros have joined to test their skill and the speed of their horses. Arya Stark, in disguise, a known lover of adventure and skilled rider, is among the competitors, riding a swift, sturdy northern breed. She nods at Ser Rodrik, recognizing him despite her guise. Arya Stark, under her breath: \\"It's not the sword that wins the battle, nor the rider that wins the race. It's the bond between horse and heart.\\" Tyrion Lannister sits outside the racecourse, a cup of wine in hand, smirking at the spectacle. Across from him, Daenerys Targaryen watches with keen interest, her dragon perched not too far above, casting a large shadow over the field. Tyrion Lannister: \\"I would wager a cask of the finest Dornish red that none can best Arya Stark in this race.\\" Daenerys Targaryen, with a slight grin: \\"Careful, Imp. The Dothraki live in the saddle. Drago is like to ride as if the very wind has taken flesh.\\" The race begins with an explosive start. The sound of dozens of horses launching forward is deafening. Ser Rodrik and Khal Drago take the lead, with Arya close behind. Ser Rodrik: (Shouting over the rush of wind) \\"You may rule the plains, Khal, but today I will teach you the meaning of haste!\\" Khal Drago, grinning wildly: (Responds in Dothraki) \\"We shall see if your foreign steed can dance with the swift sons of the Great Grass Sea!\\" As they race through the course, navigating obstacles, The Hound, not to be left behind, barrels through on his massive warhorse, Stranger. With each thunderous stride, he closes the gap, his face a mask of intense focus. The Hound: (Rumbles with laughter) \\"Hope you lot don't mind the dust! Stranger eats your fancy horses for breakfast!\\" Coming into the final stretch, Arya makes her move, urging her horse forward with a fierce cry. The horse responds, its northern stamina becoming apparent as it powers ahead. Arya Stark, yelling: \\"Winter is coming—and so am I!\\" With a burst of speed, Arya and her horse surge to the front. Ser Rodrik and Khal Drago push their mounts to the limit, but it's too late. Arya Stark crosses the finish line, proving once again her prowess in all things. Khal Drago, reining in his panting horse, nods with respect at Arya: \\"You ride well, Westerosi. You have the spirit of a Dothraki screamer.\\" Ser Rodrik, dismounting, approaches Arya, grinning broadly: \\"Seems this old knight still has much to learn. Well ridden, young wolf.\\" Arya Stark, removing her hood, revealing herself: \\"A Stark always remembers.\\" The crowd, a mix of Dothraki screamers and Westerosi lords and ladies, roars with excitement and disbelief. Daenerys approaches Arya, an approving look in her eyes. Daenerys Targaryen: \\"I could use someone with your skills. Perhaps you'd be willing to race against the wind itself, on the back of a dragon?\\" Arya Stark, with a defiant smirk: \\"Tell me, Your Grace, do dragons know the taste of defeat?\\" The crowd laughs and cheers as stories of the race – of the hooves and honor – will be told across both the plains of the Dothraki Sea and the cobbled streets of King's Landing. The day when bonds were tested, and the Fast and Furious spirit lived on, through the pounding of horse hooves against the earth. *Fade to black with the sounds of celebration, horseshoes clacking, and dragons roaring in the distance.*"},{"instruction":"Go through each essential knowledge statement and list specific topics that cover the content in the essential knowledge statement. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b. Mass of material deposited on or removed from an electrode c. Current d. Time elapsed e. Charge of ionic species EQN: I = q/t","output":"The essential knowledge statements presented are part of the Advanced Placement (AP) Chemistry curriculum framework, and they outline the fundamental concepts that students are expected to learn in the course.

Two of these items are Bowser's Curse and Bowser's Reverse Curse. Here's what they do: **Bowser's Curse:** When inflicted with Bowser's Curse, all players are cursed for a number of turns specified by Bowser (usually 1 turn). While under the effect of the curse, players can only roll a dice block that goes up to a maximum of 3, rather than the standard 10. This significantly reduces the distance they can move on the board on their next turn. **Bowser's Reverse Curse:** This curse causes all players to move in the opposite direction (backwards) on the board for a specified number of turns. This can be particularly annoying as it can send players away from their intended destination, such as a Star space, and can force them into encounters with spaces they would rather avoid. Both of these curses can affect the strategies and planning of the players, adding an element of chaos and unpredictability to the game, which is a hallmark of the Mario Party series. Bowser's various interferences are designed to add challenge and shake things up when players might be getting too comfortable."},{"instruction":"Jujutsu Kaisen: Qual É A Expansão de domínio de Satoru Gojo, e como ela funciona","output":"Satoru Gojo é um dos personagens principais de \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", uma série de mangá e anime escrita e ilustrada por Gege Akutami. Ele é conhecido por ser um dos feiticeiros mais poderosos da série, e sua técnica de Expansão de Domínio é chamada de \\"Território Ilimitado\\" (em japonês: 無量空処, \\"Muryō Kūsho\\"). A Expansão de Domínio é uma técnica avançada dentro do universo de Jujutsu Kaisen que permite ao usuário criar uma área onde sua técnica amaldiçoada é imensamente potencializada. Basicamente, é uma realidade construída sob as regras do usuário, dificultando muito para o oponente se defender ou neutralizar os ataques. A técnica \\"Território Ilimitado\\" de Gojo é baseada no princípio de sua técnica amaldiçoada chamada \\"Limitless\\" (休止呪法「無限」, \\"Kyūshi Jujutsu 'Mugen'\\"), que manipula o espaço ao infinitamente ajustar o espaço entre as coisas. Quando ele ativa o Território Ilimitado, ele cria uma área onde ele controla absolutamente o espaço, ao ponto de os conceitos de distância e direção se tornarem irrelevantes. Dentro do Território Ilimitado, Gojo pode manipular o espaço à vontade, fazendo com que seus ataques alcançem o adversário de qualquer ângulo e que seja quase impossível para o inimigo se aproximar ou tocar nele. Isso se deve ao fato de a técnica \\"Limitless\\" basear-se na Teoria do Infinito, que coloca qualquer atacante ou ataque numa sequência de aproximação que nunca realmente atinge o alvo (pense em tentar chegar a um ponto movendo-se metade da distância restante a cada tentativa - você continua se aproximando, mas nunca chega lá). Além disso, o poder do \\"Território Ilimitado\\" é tal que pode sobrecarregar os sentidos de quem é apanhado dentro dele, causando um afluxo de informações que o cérebro não é capaz de processar, levando-os a ficarem imobilizados. É importante notar que a Expansão de Domínio de Gojo é considerada uma das mais poderosas da série, refletindo sua habilidade e status como um feiticeiro de elite."},{"instruction":"Lições Que Eren Kruger nos ensina","output":"Eren Kruger é uma personagem do anime e mangá \\"Attack on Titan\\" (\\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\"), criado por Hajime Isayama. Ele é um personagem com um papel significativo na história, especialmente no que diz respeito ao passado e à herança dos Titãs. Embora sua aparição seja relativamente breve, Kruger deixa várias lições importantes que podem ser extraídas de suas ações e palavras: 1. **O peso dos sacrifícios**: Kruger teve que fazer escolhas difíceis e sacrificar muitos, inclusive compatriotas, para manter sua identidade secreta como espião. Sua história ensina sobre o peso dos sacrifícios necessários em prol de um objetivo maior e a complexidade moral que envolve tais decisões. 2. **A importância da memória e da história**: Kruger enfatiza a importância de lembrar do passado e aprender com ele. Ele encarrega Grisha Yeager, a quem passa o poder do Titã de Ataque, de cumprir essa missão, destacando que esquecer a história pode levar à repetição dos mesmos erros. 3. **Lutar pela liberdade**: Um dos temas centrais de \\"Attack on Titan\\" é a luta pela liberdade. Kruger luta contra a opressão de Marley e busca a liberdade para o povo de Eldia, mostrando que às vezes é necessário enfrentar grandes adversidades para alcançar a liberdade. 4. **O poder de uma promessa**: Kruger faz Grisha prometer que ele cumprirá a missão de retomar a Ilha Paradis e recuperar o poder dos Titãs para Eldia. A promessa é um fio condutor que move a narrativa e mostra como uma promessa pode motivar ações e mudanças significativas. 5. **A complexidade do bem e do mal**: A personagem de Kruger é um exemplo da ambiguidade moral presente em \\"Attack on Titan\\". Ele não é claramente bom ou mau; suas ações são guiadas por uma noção de justiça que o leva a cometer atos questionáveis. Isso nos ensina que a realidade é complexa e que as noções de bem e mal podem ser relativas e dependentes de perspectiva. 6. **A transmissão de vontades**: Kruger revela que os Titãs herdam não apenas os poderes, mas também as memórias e vontades de seus antecessores. Isso simboliza como as gerações passadas influenciam as atuais e como as ações de uma pessoa podem ressoar e afetar o futuro. 7. **O custo da guerra e do ódio**: Através de sua história, Kruger mostra o custo humano da guerra e do ciclo de ódio que pode perpetuar o sofrimento através das gerações. Ele destaca a necessidade de quebrar esse ciclo para alcançar uma paz verdadeira. As lições de Eren Kruger são entrelaçadas com os temas mais amplos de \\"Attack on Titan\\", oferecendo reflexões sobre a natureza humana, o poder da determinação e as consequências de nossas escolhas."},{"instruction":"O Que É O Flashtime e como ele funciona","output":"O \\"Flashtime\\" é um conceito introduzido na série de televisão \\"The Flash\\", que faz parte do Arrowverse, um conjunto de séries de televisão baseadas nos personagens da DC Comics. O Flashtime não é um termo originário dos quadrinhos, mas foi criado especificamente para a série. No contexto da série, o Flashtime é uma habilidade que Barry Allen, o Flash, utiliza para entrar em um estado onde ele se move tão rapidamente que tudo ao seu redor parece estar congelado no tempo. Quando Barry está no Flashtime, ele pode interagir com outras pessoas, trazendo-as para esse estado de super-velocidade, permitindo que elas percebam e reajam ao mundo como se estivessem se movendo a uma velocidade normal, enquanto, para todos os outros, eles estão se movendo incrivelmente rápido. Como funciona o Flashtime na série \\"The Flash\\": 1. **Percepção Acelerada**: Barry Allen, como o Flash, possui uma percepção acelerada que lhe permite ver e reagir a eventos em uma fração de segundo. O Flashtime é a extensão máxima dessa habilidade, onde ele se move e pensa tão rapidamente que o tempo normal parece estar parado. 2. **Movimento Super-Rápido**: A habilidade de entrar no Flashtime está diretamente relacionada à conexão de Barry com a Força de Aceleração, uma dimensão de energia que lhe dá seus poderes de super-velocidade. Ao acessar essa energia, ele pode se mover a velocidades que ultrapassam a percepção humana. 3. **Efeitos Físicos**: Enquanto no Flashtime, Barry pode experimentar um grande desgaste físico, pois manter essa velocidade extrema exige muito de seu corpo. Se ele permanecer nesse estado por muito tempo, pode até mesmo correr o risco de exaustão ou pior. 4. **Interação com Outros**: Uma característica única do Flashtime é a capacidade de Barry de tocar em outra pessoa e trazê-la para o estado de Flashtime com ele. Isso permite que ele converse e interaja com outros personagens em \\"tempo real\\" enquanto o mundo ao redor deles permanece em um estado de quase paralisia. O Flashtime é um exemplo de como a série \\"The Flash\\" explora as possibilidades criativas da super-velocidade e a física associada a um super-herói que pode se mover mais rápido do que a luz. Embora seja uma ficção científica e não tenha base na realidade, o conceito é usado para criar momentos dramáticos e resolver problemas de maneiras únicas dentro do universo da série."},{"instruction":"Write an unofficial and noncanonical timeline of the life of Nick Wilde from Zootopia, assuming that the movie takes place in 2016, Nick is 32 years old when the movie takes place, and Nick was born in 1984.

SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b. Mass of material deposited on or removed from an electrode c. Current d. Time elapsed e. Charge of ionic species EQN: I = q/t","output":"There are several statements provided, and each one covers a vast area of chemistry.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Go through statement below and list specific topics that cover the content in the essential knowledge statement. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b. Mass of material deposited on or removed from an electrode c. Current d. Time elapsed e.

Here are some of the main reasons why a breakwater might have two armor layers: 1. **Wave Energy Dissipation**: Multiple armor layers help to break down the energy of incoming waves more effectively. The outer layer absorbs the initial impact and dissipates some energy, while the second layer helps to further reduce the energy before it reaches the core of the breakwater. 2. **Redundancy and Reliability**: Having two armor layers provides a redundant system for protection. If the outer layer is damaged or displaced by severe storms or waves, the second layer acts as a safeguard to protect the core structure from direct impact, ensuring the breakwater's continued operation. 3. **Structural Integrity**: The layers often consist of different materials and sizes. The outer layer might be made of larger, heavier elements designed to resist the most significant forces, while the inner layer could consist of smaller, more stable materials that add to the structure's overall integrity. 4. **Adaptability to Different Wave Conditions**: Different layers can be optimized to counteract a variety of wave conditions. The outer armor may be designed to withstand high-energy wave conditions, while the inner layer may deal more effectively with lower-energy waves or contribute to overall performance stability under different wave climates. 5. **Longevity and Maintenance**: By distributing the force of the waves across two separate layers, each individual layer can be expected to last longer before needing repair or replacement. This can reduce long-term maintenance costs and efforts. 6. **Filter Layer Benefits**: The second layer can sometimes act as a filter layer, preventing the smaller material from the core or other layers from washing out while still allowing for water drainage and relieving hydrostatic pressure building up within the breakwater. 7. **Construction and Economic Considerations**: During construction, materials of various sizes and costs are used. The primary armor might consist of specially designed and often more expensive materials, like dolos, tetrapods, or accropode blocks, while the secondary layer might utilize more commonly available materials, providing a cost-effective yet robust structure. It is essential to note that the design and structure of breakwaters can be highly specific to the local conditions they are meant to withstand, such as wave height, frequency, geology, and sediment characteristics of the site. Engineers carefully consider all these factors when designing a breakwater to ensure it effectively serves its purpose of protecting coastline infrastructure while also being economically viable and long-lasting."},{"instruction":"anime like housing complex c","output":"\\"Housing Complex C\\" is an adult animated horror miniseries that follows the residents of a rundown housing complex in Japan, where strange occurrences begin to unravel as they are linked to a series of past events and supernatural happenings.

Milly and Pogo, their bodies radiating exhaustion, approached Alex’s bedside, their eyes glimmering with warmth and affection. “We’ve had quite the day, haven’t we?” Milly said with a yawn, her pink slime form appearing slightly less vibrant than usual. “We’re all exhausted, but we HAD to come and wish you a happy birthday eve, Alex.” Pogo nodded in agreement, a faint smile forming on his blue slime face. “You’ve always been there for us, Alex, supporting us and embracing our uniqueness. Tonight, as you drift off to sleep, know that we appreciate you more than words can express.” Alex’s heart swelled with gratitude, his excitement for the next day heightening.

I can’t wait to celebrate together tomorrow and make incredible memories.” With heavy eyelids and exhausted bodies, Milly and Pogo exchanged a tired glance, knowing it was time to recharge their energy.

We’ll be here, ready to celebrate your special day.” Alex watched as the puddles shifted and settled, the pink and blue slime creating whimsical patterns on the floor. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder and comfort in their presence, knowing that his friends were always there, even in their puddle forms.

In a final attempt to lull himself to sleep, Alex took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing his mind to find tranquility. Slowly, his thoughts began to settle, replaced by images of laughter, thrilling rides, and the joy of true friendship. Minutes turned into hours as Alex finally drifted off to sleep, a smile spreading across his face. In his dreams, he was surrounded by Milly and Pogo, their vibrant forms morphing into fantastic creatures and exhilarating rides, creating a world of magic and wonder.

His parents had made sure his birthday had been unforgettable, and the day had been a beautiful blur of fun and excitement. As he opened the front door and stepped into the house, a peculiar hush greeted him. The stillness was unusual, considering the energy of the day. But as he flicked on the light, a cascade of voices suddenly erupted from the living room—“Surprise!” Stunned, Alex felt his mouth drop open. The room burst into life with decorations, colorful balloons, twinkling lights, and a group of smiling faces. Among these familiar friends and family members, he immediately spotted Milly and Pogo, now returned to their humanoid slime forms, beaming brightly from ear to ear. They had transformed the room into a fantastical place, utilizing their shape-shifting abilities to mimic Alex’s favorite comic book heroes and cartoon characters. From a corner, his favorite superhero poised in an animated stance, none other than Pogo himself in a perfect rendition, while Milly had transformed part of her gooey substance into a floating cloud of a magical creature, gently floating above the guests. “Happy birthday, Alex!” Milly cheered, her body oscillating with waves of pink excitement. Pogo flashed a thumbs-up with his blue slime hand, adding, “We couldn’t let the day end without another surprise, could we?” Laughter and chatter filled the room as everyone moved in to celebrate, with Alex right in the center, overwhelmed with gratitude and surprise. The tables were laden with a rainbow of snacks and treats, each more tantalizing than the last. At the center of it all, a sizable, brightly iced cake declared ‘Happy Birthday Alex,’ with candles flickering in anticipation of a wish. As the evening unfolded, Alex felt the warmth of friendship envelop him like a comforting blanket. He joined Milly and Pogo in the festivities, partaking in games, dancing to rhythmic tunes that seemed to set the very air on a joyful bounce, and savoring every piece of his special day. As the time came to blow out his candles, Alex closed his eyes. He took a deep breath, feeling every bit of love and happiness from those gathered around him, and from Milly and Pogo, who had shown him the true depth of intergalactic friendship. In his heart, he made a wish—a wish for many more shared adventures, for endless laughter, and for the precious bond of friendship to last a lifetime. With one big puff, Alex extinguished the flickering lights atop his cake, opening his eyes to the cheers and applause from everyone in the room. Milly and Pogo rushed forward, their slimy forms enveloping him in a uniquely squishy hug that somehow felt just right. The night went on, with stories exchanged, plans for future escapades discussed, and promises to always remain close, no matter where their adventures might lead them. As guests eventually said their goodbyes and the evening quieted down, Alex, Milly, and Pogo sat together amidst the remnants of the party, a serene contentment settling around them. As they tidied up, putting things back in place and wiping away trails of spilled punch, Alex couldn’t help but feel a sense of bittersweet happiness. Tonight was a testament to the beauty of friendship, the joy of surprises, and the cherished memories that would stay with him forever. With the house finally quiet and the hour growing late, Milly and Pogo prepared to take their leave, knowing they had given Alex a birthday to remember. With a final wave and a promise to return tomorrow for more fun, they slipped out into the night, heading back to their own home. Alex stood in the doorway, watching as their silhouetted forms disappeared into the cool night. As he closed the door, he smiled, certain that the bond he shared with Milly and Pogo was something extraordinary—something not even the stars could contain. Exhausted but filled with an immeasurable sense of joy, Alex returned to his room, the visions of the party still dancing in his mind. As he nestled into his bed, his thoughts turned to dreams of what tomorrow might bring, knowing that with friends like Milly and Pogo, the wonders of the universe were just a shape-shift away. And as he drifted off into peaceful sleep, the last thing he heard was a distant echo of Milly’s bubbly laughter and Pogo’s reassuring words, echoing through the galaxy that had brought them all together. Write a story where Milly seems to be in trouble, she is only a pink, bubbling pool, unresponsive, After failed remedies, Pogo tries something he made, and lo behold it works, Alex gets jealous for this, but Milly gets him to calm down","output":"It was a crisp autumn day, and the town square was abuzz with activity, as children ran about, their laughter mingling with the chatter of vendors and the occasional bark of stray dogs. Amid the familiar chaos, Alex felt a sense of foreboding. He hadn't seen Milly all morning, which was unusual, given her penchant for popping up whenever least expected. His concern growing, Alex set out to find her, his footsteps quickening as he navigated the cobblestone streets. He remembered the previous day's laughter and the games they had played by the riverside. Milly, in high spirits as always, had transformed into a pink sailboat, her laughter echoing over the water. Turning a familiar corner, Alex's heart leaped to his throat. There, in a quiet alleyway, he found her—but not as he had hoped. Milly was no longer the lively, mischievous slime girl he knew but a troubled, shapeless pink pool, gently bubbling as if in distress. \\"Milly!\\" Alex cried, crouching beside the unresponsive puddle. \\"What's happened to you?\\" He reached out tentatively, his fingers barely grazing the surface of the pool, but there was no response—not even a ripple of recognition. She was inert, her usual vibrancy reduced to a mere echo in the quivering goo. Panic setting in, Alex racked his brain for any knowledge of slime biology or what could aid Milly. He remembered tales of magical herbs and healing potions; perhaps they could help. Taking off his jacket, he laid it on the ground beside her, a silent promise that he would not leave her side. Moments turned to minutes, and Alex's futile attempts to revive Milly with the gentlest prods and softly spoken words bore no fruit. It was then that he remembered Pogo and rushed to find him, certain that Milly's brother would know what to do. Pogo was tinkering in his makeshift lab, his blue form pulsing with concentration. At the sight of the panic-stricken Alex, however, he dropped everything. \\"Milly's in trouble,\\" Alex blurted, the desperation in his voice cutting through the air like a knife. Without hesitation, Pogo followed Alex to the alley where Milly lay. He took one look at his sister's pitiful state and turned somber. \\"I may have something that could help,\\" he murmured, more to himself than to Alex. Pogo withdrew a small vial from the folds of his gooey being—a glinting liquid of silver and blue swirled within. Alex watched with bated breath as Pogo carefully poured the concoction onto Milly's bubbling form. A tense moment passed, and then another, the silence almost deafening. But suddenly, like the first ray of sunlight after a storm, Milly began to coalesce. Her shape started to form once again, the pink slime drawing inwards and taking on her familiar humanoid shape. The relief was palpable as Milly's eyes fluttered open, her smile weak but present. \\"Wha—what happened?\\" she managed to ask, her voice a mere whisper. \\"You had us worried there, little sister,\\" Pogo said, wrapping her in an embrace that only a slime could give. As the siblings reunited, a shadow crossed Alex's heart—jealousy. Milly had been his friend first, his companion. How could Pogo have known what to do when he, Alex, was left clueless? Alex turned away, his feelings a tumultuous whirlwind. He was torn between joy at Milly's recovery and envy at Pogo's heroics. Milly, sensing the shift in mood, morphed a part of her form into a comforting hand, reaching out to Alex. \\"Hey,\\" she said softly, \\"Are you okay?\\" Alex took a deep breath, forcing a smile. \\"Yeah, I'm just glad you're all right,\\" he replied, though the jealousy clung to him like a second skin. Milly's eyes shone with understanding. \\"Alex, you are my dear friend. You rushed to find help for me, remember? You care, and that's what truly matters.\\" Pogo, catching the unease, added, \\"Alex, we're a team. All of us. You're just as much a part of this family. My concoction worked this time, but it was your devotion that led you to seek help. We all have our strengths and roles to play.\\" The sincerity in their words soothed Alex's frayed nerves. He knelt by Milly, taking her slime hand in his. \\"I just wanted to help you, Milly,\\" he said, the jealousy finally ebbing away. \\"I'm sorry I felt that way.\\" Milly giggled, a sound filled with warmth. \\"Silly Alex, there's no need for apologies. You're our friend, and that's what counts. Now, who's up for some more adventures? I've got to make up for lost time!\\" As Milly bounced back to her energetic self, Pogo winking conspiratorially at Alex, the trio laughed and set off down the street. Their friendship had been tested, but as always, it emerged stronger—unyielding as the bonds of slime that held them together."},{"instruction":"使用英文原版《深夜小狗神秘事件》回答以下问题 1. How does Christopher justify his investigation into how Wellington died, even though his father has told him to stay out of other people’s business? 2. What character qualities does Christopher have that would make him a good detective? 3. Why doesn’t Christopher like chatting? 4. How does Christopher work out who his prime suspect is? 5. What makes Christopher think he would make a good astronaut? Do you agree that he would qualify? 6. What does Christopher discover about Mr. Shears from Mrs. Alexander? 7. Add 5-10 more behaviors to Christopher’s usual/unusual behavior chart in your book. 8. Continue adding directly quoted information to your character chart for Mother/Father.","output":"\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" written by Mark Haddon is the book you're referring to. While I can't directly quote from the book, as it is a copyrighted text, I can provide a summary or analysis of your questions based on my knowledge of the novel without using direct quotes. 1. Christopher justifies his investigation into Wellington's death because he sees it as a puzzle that needs to be solved. For him, finding out the truth is very important, and he approaches the situation with a logical and straightforward mindset, similar to his idol, the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. He believes that truth and facts are important, and his desire to solve the mystery overcomes his father's instructions. 2. Christopher possesses several qualities that make him a good detective. He is extremely observant and notices details that others may overlook. He also has an excellent memory and is very logical; he prefers facts and figures over emotions, making him less likely to be swayed by personal biases. Additionally, his ability to focus intensely on tasks and his fondness for puzzles and problem-solving contribute to his investigative potential. 3. Christopher doesn't like chatting because he finds it confusing and overwhelming. He prefers straightforward communication and often struggles to interpret metaphors, jokes, and nonliteral language. As he experiences the world from the perspective of someone with autism spectrum condition, social interactions such as small talk can be challenging and stressful for him. 4. Christopher works out who his prime suspect is through a process of elimination and by gathering evidence. He approaches the mystery methodically, asking questions and observing the behavior of those around him. He considers various scenarios and uses his attention to detail to piece together clues that may point towards the potential culprit. 5. Christopher believes he would make a good astronaut because he likes small enclosed spaces, he is very intelligent, and he's good at mathematics and understanding how machines work. He also mentions his ability to concentrate and follow instructions. Some of these are indeed qualities that would be useful for an astronaut. However, the highly complex social and physical demands of space travel could be challenging for someone with his particular traits and needs. 6. From Mrs. Alexander, Christopher discovers that Mr. Shears was once married to Christopher's mother and had an affair with her, which led to their relationship breaking down. 7. In terms of adding more to Christopher's behavior chart, this would be something you could analyze based on his actions throughout the book. Look for instances where Christopher's actions are described and categorize them as 'usual' (typical for him) or 'unusual.' For example, his aversion to being touched could be considered a usual behavior, while willingly going to a crowded place might be unusual. 8. For the character chart for Mother/Father, you would review the text and find descriptions, actions, or dialogue that reflect their characters and plot them onto your chart.

O Demônio de Laplace foi proposto pelo matemático e físico Pierre-Simon Laplace, no século XIX. Segundo o conceito, se um demônio (ou ser inteligente) fosse capaz de observar as velocidades e posições das partículas de um sistema em nível microscópico, ele poderia separar as partículas de alta energia das de baixa energia, criando assim um gradiente de temperatura sem a necessidade de realizar trabalho. Isso violaria a segunda lei da termodinâmica, que afirma que a entropia de um sistema isolado sempre aumenta ao longo do tempo. O Demônio de Maxwell foi proposto pelo físico James Clerk Maxwell, também no século XIX. Ele considerou um demônio capaz de abrir e fechar uma porta em um compartimento que permitiria a passagem apenas das partículas de alta energia de um gás, enquanto bloqueava as partículas de baixa energia. Isso também violaria a segunda lei da termodinâmica, pois o demônio seria capaz de criar uma maior concentração de energia em um lado da câmara sem a necessidade de realizar trabalho. Ambos os conceitos são considerados paradoxos termodinâmicos, pois desafiam a noção de que a entropia sempre aumenta em um sistema fechado. Na prática, não se acredita que os demônios de Laplace e Maxwell possam realmente existir, pois contradizem os princípios fundamentais da termodinâmica."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Interpretado por Tom Cavanagh e Matt Letscher em diferentes momentos da série, Thawne é um velocista do futuro obcecado com Barry Allen, o Flash. O objetivo principal de Eobard Thawne na série é derrotar Barry Allen, seu arqui-inimigo. Thawne é motivado por uma mistura de rivalidade, inveja e uma complexa história pessoal que envolve viajar no tempo. Originalmente, ele era um grande fã de Flash e uma espécie de historiador de velocistas no futuro, mas quando descobre que seu destino é tornar-se o maior inimigo do Flash, sua obsessão toma um rumo sombrio. No primeiro arco da história da série, Thawne viaja de volta no tempo para matar o jovem Barry Allen, mas ao falhar, ele acaba matando a mãe de Barry em vez disso. Este evento traumático define a vida de Barry e o coloca no caminho para se tornar o Flash. Para retornar ao seu tempo, Thawne assume a identidade do Dr. Harrison Wells e ajuda Barry a aprimorar suas habilidades como Flash, com o objetivo secreto de usar a velocidade de Barry para criar uma ruptura no tempo que permita a Thawne retornar ao seu próprio tempo. Ao longo da série, os objetivos de Thawne podem mudar ligeiramente conforme novos arcos da história se desenrolam, com seus planos frequentemente envolvendo complexidades de viagens no tempo, manipulação de eventos históricos e tentativas de manter ou aumentar seu próprio poder como velocista. No entanto, seu desejo de derrotar e, às vezes, destruir a vida de Barry Allen continua sendo uma constante em seus objetivos. Deve-se notar que \\"The Flash\\" da CW continua a desenvolver e expandir seu universo narrativo a cada temporada, então objetivos e motivações de personagens como Eobard Thawne podem evoluir ou ser revelados em maior profundidade conforme a série progride."},{"instruction":"Qual é o motivo e razão específica para ele odiar Barry","output":"Na série \\"The Flash\\" da CW, a razão específica para o ódio de Eobard Thawne por Barry Allen é complexa e está enraizada na história de fundo do personagem e nas viagens no tempo. Eobard Thawne, oriundo do século 22, inicialmente era um grande admirador de Barry Allen e do legado do Flash. Ele estudou a história do Flash e até replicou o acidente que deu a Barry seus poderes, tornando-se um velocista. No entanto, ao viajar no tempo para conhecer seu herói, Thawne descobre que ele está destinado a se tornar o Reverse-Flash, o arqui-inimigo do Flash. Essa revelação o abala profundamente e inicia sua transformação em vilão. A obsessão de Thawne com Barry Allen e o legado do Flash se torna uma mistura de admiração e ódio. Ele se ressente do fato de que, não importa o que faça, ele está destinado a ser lembrado como um vilão na história, em contraste com a adoração e o respeito que Barry recebe como herói. Essa inveja e ressentimento se transformam em um ódio profundo e uma necessidade de provar sua superioridade sobre o Flash. Além disso, as viagens no tempo e as alterações na linha do tempo contribuem para aprofundar o conflito entre Thawne e Barry. Ao longo da série, Thawne manipula eventos e pessoas para tentar garantir sua própria existência e sucesso, enquanto Barry e sua equipe trabalham para detê-lo e corrigir os danos causados à linha do tempo. Em resumo, o ódio de Eobard Thawne por Barry Allen é uma combinação de inveja, destino, e uma série de confrontos e interações ao longo do tempo que solidificam Thawne como o Reverse-Flash, o inimigo que ele nunca quis ser, mas que acabou abraçando completamente."},{"instruction":"Crie uma versão literalmente: suprema e perfeita Do Alien X","output":"Alien X é um personagem da série animada \\"Ben 10\\", especificamente um dos alienígenas que Ben Tennyson pode se transformar usando o Omnitrix.

Eren Yeager, com inteligência infinita, teria um conhecimento absoluto e compreensão de todos os aspectos da realidade, incluindo: 1. **Conhecimento Onisciente:** Eren saberia tudo que é possível saber, incluindo o passado, presente e futuro de todos os universos e dimensões, bem como as leis da física, matemática, biologia, e todas as outras ciências e disciplinas. 2. **Entendimento Perfeito:** Ele entenderia completamente todas as línguas, culturas, emoções e motivações de todos os seres vivos, bem como as complexidades das relações sociais e políticas em qualquer sociedade. 3. **Capacidade de Estratégia Ilimitada:** Eren teria a habilidade de criar estratégias e planos perfeitos, antecipando todas as variáveis e resultados possíveis, o que seria particularmente útil em sua luta contra os Titãs e na busca pela liberdade de seu povo. 4. **Manipulação e Inovação Tecnológica:** Com um entendimento completo de tecnologia e ciência, Eren poderia desenvolver ou melhorar tecnologias existentes em seu mundo, potencialmente encontrando novas maneiras de combater os Titãs ou resolver outros problemas. 5. **Habilidade de Resolução de Problemas:** Qualquer desafio ou enigma seria instantaneamente solucionável por Eren, pois sua inteligência infinita lhe permitiria ver todas as soluções possíveis. **Processo de Concessão de Inteligência Infinita:** Alien X Infinito, ao decidir conceder inteligência infinita a Eren, realizaria um ato que transcende a mera alteração de habilidades mentais. Ele estaria essencialmente redefinindo a essência de Eren como um ser humano, elevando-o a um estado de consciência e compreensão que vai além da condição humana. Isso poderia envolver: 1. **Reestruturação Cerebral:** Alien X Infinito poderia alterar a estrutura cerebral de Eren para suportar o vasto conhecimento e processamento de informações sem sobrecarregar ou danificar sua mente. 2. **Conexão Cósmica:** Eren poderia ser conectado a uma fonte de conhecimento universal, permitindo-lhe acessar informações de todas as realidades e dimensões em tempo real. 3. **Proteção Mental:** Para evitar que Eren seja consumido ou sobrecarregado por seu novo poder, Alien X Infinito poderia instalar salvaguardas mentais que permitiriam a Eren manter sua sanidade e personalidade. **Implicações Narrativas:** Conceder inteligência infinita a Eren Yeager teria implicações profundas para a narrativa de \\"Attack on Titan\\". Com tal poder, Eren poderia resolver conflitos centrais da história de maneiras inesperadas, potencialmente encontrando uma solução pacífica para a guerra entre Marley e Eldia ou descobrindo a verdadeira origem dos Titãs e como erradicá-los sem violência. No entanto, é crucial lembrar que este é um exercício de imaginação e não reflete as histórias reais de \\"Ben 10\\" ou \\"Attack on Titan\\". Na prática, os criadores de cada série definem os limites e as capacidades dos personagens dentro de seus respectivos universos."},{"instruction":"Eren Poderia Fazer Annie Se apaixonar por ele através de um diálogo","output":"Em \\"Attack on Titan\\", as relações entre os personagens são complexas e profundamente enraizadas em suas experiências pessoais e no mundo ao seu redor. Eren Yeager e Annie Leonhart são dois personagens com histórias e motivações próprias que influenciam suas interações e sentimentos um pelo outro. Annie Leonhart é uma personagem que, ao longo da série, é retratada como alguém distante e focada em suas missões. Seu treinamento e lealdade a Marley, bem como sua missão como uma das Titãs infiltradas, a tornam uma pessoa fechada e cautelosa em relação aos seus sentimentos e a quem ela confia. A possibilidade de Eren fazer Annie se apaixonar por ele através de um diálogo dependeria de muitos fatores, incluindo a sinceridade de Eren, a receptividade de Annie, o contexto da conversa e a evolução dos personagens até aquele ponto. O amor é um sentimento complexo e não pode ser forçado ou criado artificialmente apenas por meio de palavras; requer uma conexão emocional genuína e mútua. Em um cenário realista e fiel à narrativa de \\"Attack on Titan\\", Eren teria que entender profundamente Annie, suas motivações e medos, e encontrar um terreno comum que pudesse aproximar os dois. Isso exigiria empatia, vulnerabilidade e tempo para desenvolver um relacionamento baseado em confiança e respeito mútuos. No entanto, é importante lembrar que \\"Attack on Titan\\" é uma história com temas sombrios e complexos, onde as relações pessoais são muitas vezes secundárias às lutas maiores que os personagens enfrentam. O desenvolvimento de um romance entre Eren e Annie, ou qualquer outro par de personagens, dependeria inteiramente da direção criativa tomada pelo autor da série, Hajime Isayama. Portanto, enquanto é teoricamente possível para qualquer dois personagens desenvolverem sentimentos românticos um pelo outro, isso dependeria da narrativa estabelecida e das escolhas dos personagens dentro da história."},{"instruction":"EREN com inteligência infinita","output":"Se Eren Yeager de \\"Attack on Titan\\" possuísse inteligência infinita, isso teria um impacto significativo em sua capacidade de influenciar os eventos dentro da série. Com inteligência infinita, Eren seria capaz de entender completamente as motivações, histórias e vulnerabilidades de todos os personagens, incluindo Annie Leonhart. Com esse nível de compreensão, Eren poderia teoricamente encontrar a maneira perfeita de se comunicar com Annie, abordando-a de uma maneira que ressoasse com suas experiências pessoais e emoções. Ele poderia usar esse conhecimento para criar um diálogo que não apenas expressasse seus próprios sentimentos e desejos, mas também reconhecesse e validasse os de Annie. No entanto, mesmo com inteligência infinita, a capacidade de fazer alguém se apaixonar por outra pessoa não é garantida. O amor é um sentimento complexo e profundamente pessoal que não pode ser reduzido a uma fórmula ou manipulado com certeza absoluta. O amor envolve escolhas, química, e uma série de fatores subjetivos que vão além do racional e do previsível. Além disso, Annie é uma personagem com sua própria agência e livre-arbítrio. Suas decisões e sentimentos são o resultado de sua própria jornada pessoal, e não algo que possa ser mudado facilmente por alguém, mesmo que essa pessoa tenha inteligência infinita. A capacidade de Eren de influenciar os sentimentos de Annie dependeria de sua vontade de se abrir e se conectar com ele em um nível emocional. Em última análise, a ideia de Eren com inteligência infinita é um exercício especulativo que explora as possibilidades narrativas dentro do universo de \\"Attack on Titan\\". Na realidade da série, os personagens e suas relações são definidos pelo autor, Hajime Isayama, e qualquer desenvolvimento entre Eren e Annie seria determinado pela história que ele deseja contar."},{"instruction":"Como Alien X infinito Poderia Aperfeiçoar Em Su A NZT-48","output":"A NZT-48 é uma droga fictícia do filme \\"Sem Limites\\" (Limitless) e da série de TV subsequente, que aumenta drasticamente a cognição humana, permitindo ao usuário acessar 100% da capacidade cerebral e lembrar de todas as experiências com detalhes perfeitos. Embora a NZT-48 seja um produto da ficção e não exista na realidade, podemos especular como um ser com poderes ilimitados, como o Alien X Infinito que imaginamos anteriormente, poderia aperfeiçoá-la. **Aperfeiçoamento da NZT-48 por Alien X Infinito:** 1. **Eliminação de Efeitos Colaterais:** A NZT-48 no filme e na série tem efeitos colaterais graves quando o uso é interrompido ou quando é consumida por um longo período. Alien X Infinito poderia reestruturar a droga em nível molecular para eliminar completamente esses efeitos colaterais negativos, tornando-a segura para uso contínuo. 2. **Potencialização dos Efeitos:** Embora a NZT-48 já conceda uma melhoria significativa na cognição, Alien X Infinito poderia ampliar esses efeitos para além da capacidade cerebral humana, permitindo ao usuário não apenas acessar toda a memória e processamento cerebral, mas também expandir a consciência para níveis sobre-humanos. 3. **Sustentabilidade:** Para garantir que os efeitos da droga sejam permanentes, Alien X Infinito poderia alterar a biologia do usuário de forma que a produção da substância ativa da NZT-48 seja naturalmente sintetizada pelo próprio corpo, removendo a necessidade de ingestão contínua. 4. **Adaptação Universal:** Alien X Infinito poderia modificar a NZT-48 para que ela funcionasse em qualquer ser biológico, independentemente das diferenças fisiológicas, permitindo que qualquer espécie experimentasse seus benefícios. 5. **Consciência Expandida:** A droga aprimorada poderia permitir que o usuário não apenas acessasse a totalidade de suas capacidades cognitivas, mas também se conectasse a uma consciência coletiva ou banco de dados universal, obtendo conhecimento além de sua experiência pessoal. 6. **Proteção Cerebral:** A NZT-48 aperfeiçoada incluiria mecanismos de proteção que impediriam danos cerebrais ou sobrecarga cognitiva, garantindo que o aumento da atividade cerebral não prejudique o usuário. 7. **Autoregulação:** A droga poderia ter a capacidade de se autoajustar de acordo com as necessidades do usuário, equilibrando os efeitos para otimizar o desempenho sem comprometer a saúde ou o bem-estar. 8. **Integração com o Omnitrix:** Como um acréscimo, Alien X Infinito poderia integrar a fórmula aprimorada da NZT-48 ao Omnitrix, permitindo que Ben Tennyson ou qualquer usuário do dispositivo tenha acesso aos efeitos aprimorados da droga ao se transformar em qualquer alienígena.

TINTIN And I'd do it in a heartbeat, Captain. Every single time. Captain Haddock meets Tintin's gaze, emotions swelling behind his cybernetic eye. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Gently lays his metallic hand on Tintin's) And I'd trust you to the ends of the Earth, lad. To the ends of time, it now seems. They share a quiet moment, the bond between them unspoken yet deeply felt. The train emits a low chime, signaling the approach of their destination—a reminder of the impending reset. TINTIN (Softly) Our stories, they might fade into this cosmic loop, Captain. But I feel... fortunate. Grateful to have lived them with you. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Nods, eyes glistening) Aye, to have sailed the stars with the best of comrades—the heart couldn't ask for more. The cabin around them begins to thrum with a more intense frequency. The glow from the approaching black hole casts a peaceful light over the two companions. TINTIN (Steady and calm) Are you ready, Captain? CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Lets out a long breath) As I'll ever be... Whatever comes, we'll face it head-on. Together. TINTIN Together. The two remain seated, close in spirit, as the train enters the edge of the black hole.

In the distance, a weathered vessel named \\"Sirius\\" shows signs of recent arrival. Crew members are busily unloading crates and gear. One figure stands out: Captain Haddock, older, a little less cyborg after the reset but nevertheless exuding a rugged charisma. He's barking orders, not noticing Tintin's approach.

WHARF – DAY The wharf is bustling with life, seagulls gliding overhead as the sound of the sea is punctuated with the chatter of traders and mariners. Tintin, focused and calm, moves through the crowd toward the Sirius, where Captain Haddock stands amongst his crew, animated and in his element. As Tintin approaches, he stops abruptly—a look of mild surprise crosses his face. He seems to brace himself for something unseen. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Shouting to a sailor) Billions of blistering blue barnacles, watch where you're stepping, you... Just as the words leave his mouth, Tintin reaches out and catches a rope that comes loose from a pulley overhead. Haddock, oblivious to Tintin's foresight, spins around at the commotion. HADDOCK (Startled, then relieved) Tintin! That would've taken a man's head clean off! How on earth did you...? TINTIN (Smiling wryly, coiling the rope securely) Just a lucky guess, Captain. As they exchange smiles, a stack of cargo boxes begins to wobble dangerously. Tintin, with no apparent reason yet fully aware of what's to come, is already on the move. He pushes a distracted sailor out of the way, just as the boxes come crashing down where he'd been standing moments before. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Astonished, rushing over) Thundering typhoons! You've got the reflexes of a cat! TINTIN (Nonchalant) Just keeping everyone safe, Captain. It's all in the reflexes. The crew begins to murmur amongst themselves, casting Tintin admiring glances. Haddock, however, eyes Tintin with a newfound curiosity. HADDOCK (Grinning, poking fun) You wouldn't happen to have a crystal ball hidden in that coat of yours, would you? TINTIN (Laughing it off) Nothing of the sort, I assure you. Before Haddock can inquire further, Tintin's attention is already turned toward a sailor carrying a tray of paint cans precariously balanced. Sure enough, as Tintin sidesteps into the path, he steadies the sailor's arm just as he stumbles, preventing a colorful disaster. TINTIN (Playing it cool) Careful there, those look messy. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Scratching his head in bewilderment) Tintin, my boy, you're a walking miracle today! TINTIN (Shrugging with mock modesty) Seems like it's just my day, Captain. Haddock watches Tintin with a sense of awe as Tintin continues to anticipate and prevent mishaps. A small crowd gathers, awestruck at the young reporter's uncanny timing and reactions. As the Sirius finally sets sail, Tintin joins Haddock on the bridge. The captain looks at Tintin with a mix of gratitude and wonder. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Seriously) You've saved more than a few skins today, Tintin. I'm beginning to think there's more than luck at play here. TINTIN (Gazing out to sea) Let's just say, sometimes, I get a feeling about things. And today, I'm feeling like this voyage will be one to remember. HADDOCK (Laughing heartily) Well, you can bet your last doubloon on that! With you on board, Tintin, I think we'll all be able to breathe a little easier. As the Sirius charts a course toward the horizon, Tintin stands by Captain Haddock's side, both men looking forward to the adventures ahead, with Tintin's mysterious foresight promising to make it all the more extraordinary.

CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Shouting) Ten thousand typhoons, be careful with that— Before Haddock can finish, Tintin reaches up and catches a swinging boom that was about to hit a sailor. TINTIN (With a knowing smile) Saw it coming. Haddock, startled by Tintin's precise intervention, looks at him with baffled gratitude. HADDOCK (Amazed) Tintin, that was— Tintin looks over to a stack of cargo crates that begins to teeter dangerously. In three swift steps, he's there, steadying the pile with one hand. TINTIN (Nonchalantly) All in balance. The crew starts murmuring in awe at the young reporter's seemingly impossible reflexes. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Eyes wide, chuckling) Some sixth sense? TINTIN (Cheekily) Just lucky guesses. As Tintin and Haddock share an understanding smile, a sailor holding an armful of tools trips near them. Without hesitation, Tintin reaches out, catching the tools before they scatter. TINTIN (Smoothing the situation) No harm done. HADDOCK (Admiringly) You're on fire!

However, the effects of the night howlers are not permanent. In the film, characters who have been affected by the night howlers are eventually cured through an antidote created by scientists. The return to their normal state is shown to be complete, with no lasting harm seen from the exposure. In the game \\"Cave Story,\\" the red flowers have a similarly dramatic effect on the creatures known as Mimigas. When they consume red flowers, Mimigas become filled with rage and transform into aggressive and mindlessly violent creatures. Unlike \\"Zootopia,\\" there isn't an explicit cure shown within the game for the red flower's influence. The only apparent solution to prevent the destructive behavior of the affected Mimigas is to avoid exposing them to the flowers in the first place or, unfortunately, to defeat them if they become too dangerous. There are hints throughout the game that once a Mimiga has consumed the red flower, its effects are irreversible, leading to permanent consequences.

DNA에 있는 연속한 3개의 염기가 하나의 아미노산을 지정하며, 아미노산이 모이면 단백질이 된다. 단백질은 생명체 자체를 만드는 재료이면서 모든 화학반응을 제어하는 촉매 역할을 한다. 인간과 고등어가 다르다면 그들을 구성하는 단백질이 다른 것이다. 염기에는 아데닌, 티민, 구아닌, 시토신이라는 네 종류가 있는데, 모두 탄소, 질소, 산소 대여섯 개가 오·육각형을 이루며 결합된 작은 분자에 불과하다. 아데닌과 티민, 구아닌과 시토신은 각각 두 개, 세 개의 수소를 매개로 결합된다. 부모의 DNA를 자손에 전달할 때, 이 결합이 끊어진다. 결국 생명의 핵심 원리인 유전은 바로 이들 원자 몇 개 수준, 즉 양자역학적 원리에 따라 제어되고 있는 것이다. 하지만 놀랍게도 생물학자들은 양자역학을 잘 모른다. 왜 그럴까? 생명과 관련된 모든 물질은 원자로 되어 있고, 원자는 양자역학으로 설명된다. 문제는 ‘딱 여기까지’라는 거다. 생명체를 이루는 분자들은 여전히 눈에 보이지 않을 만큼 작지만, 어마어마하게 많은 수의 원자로 이뤄져 있다. 예를 들어 단백질 공장인 리보솜을 만들려면 원자 수십만 개 가 필요하다. 이렇게 많은 수의 원자로 이뤄진 계에 양자역학을 직접 적용하는 것은 현재의 계산능력으로는 불가능하다. 원자 하나를 행렬역학으로 기술하는 데 10개의 숫자를 사용한다면, 원자 10만 개를 기술하기 위해 숫자가 10100000개나 필요하게 된다. 이 수는 우주전체 원자의 개수보다 크다. 쓰는 것 조차 불가능하다는 뜻이다. ● 광합성과 철새의 양자생물학 철새는 서로 다른 방향의 스핀이 생기는 비율을 보고 북극과 남극의 방향을 알 수 있다. - istockphoto 제공 철새는 서로 다른 방향의 스핀이 생기는 비율을 보고 북극과 남극의 방향을 알 수 있다. - istockphoto 제공 생물학자는 분자를 마치 거시세계의 축구공처럼 다룬다. 꼭 필요한 부분에만 양자역학 개념을 사용할 뿐이다. 하이브리드라고나 할까. 분자 자체는 양자역학적 원리로 구성돼 있으나 분자 전체를 한 단위로 보았을 때 이것은 공이나 다름없다는 말이다. 불과 60개의 탄소원자가 모여 만들어진 풀러렌이란 분자조차 양자 간섭을 일으키려면 특별한 조건을 준비해야 한다(슈뢰딩거 고양이는 누가 죽였나? 참고). 결어긋남이 일어나는 것을 막아야 한다는 말이다. 결어긋남이란 측정당할 때 일어난다. 원자 하나만 부딪혀도 측정이 일어난다. 따라서 고온의 물에 담겨있는 생명체에서 결어긋남을 막는 것은 거의 불가능하다(양자 중첩의 입장에서는 상온도 엄청나게 높은 온도다). 그래서 대부분의 양자실험은 진공, 또는 영하 270℃정도의 극저온에서 수행된다. 양자 중첩을 이용하는 양자컴퓨터는 기존의 컴퓨터가 할 수 없는 일을 하거나 효율을 극적으로 높일 수 있다(세상에서 가장 강력한 컴퓨터 참고). 혹시 생명체가 생존을 위해 양자 중첩을 이용하고 있는 사례는 없을까? 진화란 생존에 조금이라도 유리하면 그 방향으로 가는 거다. 양자 중첩이 좋다면 생명이 이용하지 못할 이유도 없다. 이름하여 양자생물학! 2007년 UC버클리대 플레밍 교수 연구팀은 광합성에서 양자 중첩의 증거를 발견한다. 광합성은 태양에너지를 화학에너지로 바꾸는 것으로 생명체의 가장 중요한 에너지원이다. 중·고등학교 생물시간에 ‘전자전달계’라는 것을 들어 봤을 것이다. 이때 나오는 반응물의 이름을 달달 외우던 악몽이 떠오르는 사람도 있을 거다. 깔때기 모양의 단백질에 빛이 닿으면 전자가 들떠서 깔때기 중심으로 이동하게 된다. 빛에 닿는 면적이 커야하므로 단백질이 깔때기 모양인 것은 당연하다. 다만 들뜬 전자의 이동 과정이 지나치게 효율적이라는 것이 의문이다. 전자를 공이라고 생각해보자. 중심이 어딘지 알 길 없으니 전자는 여기저기 마구잡이로 부딪히며 이동하고 당연히 에너지를 잃게 된다. 하지만 실제 에너지 효율은 예상보다 훨씬 높다. 왜 그럴까? 플래밍 교수는 여기에 양자 중첩이 작동한다고 제안한다. 전자가 모든 경로를 동시에 훑어보고 최단경로를 찾아 고속도로를 탄 것처럼 이동한다는 것이다. 경로들이 양자 중첩돼 있어야 가능한 얘기다. 하지만 결어긋남의 요인들이 득실거리는 생명체 내에서 식물이 어떻게 결맞음을 유지하는지는 여전히 미스터리다. 양자생물학은 철새의 비행도 설명한다. 철새가 지형지물 하나 없는 바다 한 가운데서 어떻게 방향을 찾아가는지는 여전히 불가사의다. 양자생물학의 설명방법은 이렇다. 철새의 눈에 빛이 들어가면 두 개의 라디칼이 쌍으로 만들어진다. 각 라디칼은 홀전자(unpaired electron)를 하나씩 갖는다. 이 두 홀전자들은 특별한 관계를 형성한다. 전자는 그 자체로 자석이 될 수 있는데, 이런 특성을 스핀이라 부른다. 특별한 관계라는 것은 전자의 스핀들이 양자얽힘 상태를 이룬다는 뜻이다. 예를 들어 한 전자의 스핀이 북쪽을 가리킬 때, 다른 전자의 스핀은 남쪽을 가리키는 방식이다. 이 경우 라디칼 전자들의 두 스핀은 두 가지 방식으로 얽힐 수 있다. 편의상 A와 B라고 부르자. A와 B 가운데 어떤 방식으로 얽힐지는 외부 자기장의 방향에 의존한다. 따라서 A와 B의 생성 비율을 보면 지구자기장 방향을 알 수 있다. 철새의 눈에 양자나침반이 들어있는 셈이다. 하지만 살아있는 새에서 이뤄진 실험이 아니기에 아직 논란이 있다. ● 인류는 양자생명체로 진화할까 1989년 로저 펜로즈는 ‘황제의 새마음’이란 책에서 양자역학이 인간의 의식을 이해하는 데 중요하다고 주장한다. 펜로즈는 우선 인간의 의식에 계산으로 설명할 수 없는 것이 있음을 보여준다. 예를 들어 “합이 홀수가 되는 두 짝수는 무엇인가?”라는 문제를 생각해보자. 짝수와 짝수를 더하면 언제나 짝수가 된다. 따라서 우리는 이런 짝수는 존재하지 않는다는 것을 안다. 컴퓨터는 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 계산을 시작할 거다. 2+2=4, 2+4=6, 4+4=8.... 하지만 이런 식으로는 결코 답을 구할 수 없다. 물론 이런 문제는 결과를 그냥 외워둘 수도 있겠지만, ‘페르마의 마지막 정리’나 ‘골드바흐 추측’ 같은 문제는 계산으로 절대 해결할 수 없다. 인류의 진화에도 양자법칙이 숨어있을까? - 과학동아(일러스트 김정훈) 제공 인류의 진화에도 양자법칙이 숨어있을까? - 과학동아(일러스트 김정훈) 제공 펜로즈는 양자역학을 이용해야 이런 문제가 해결된다고 주장했다. 구체적으로 뇌세포의 미세소관을 양자 중첩이 일어나는 곳으로 지목했다. 여기에 대한 주류학계의 반응은 냉랭하다. 양자 중첩이 인간의 의식에서 의미 있는 역할을 한다는 어떤 실험적 증거도 아직 없기 때문이다. 생명체 내에서 결맞음을 유지하는 것이 어렵다. 더구나 양자 중력까지 등장하는 그의 이론은 지나치게 앞서 갔다는 평가가 많다. 양자 중력은 아직 아무도 알지 못하는 물리학의 성배이기 때문이다. 진화의 역사를 보라. 양자역학이 생존에 이익이 된다면 생명은 이를 반드시 이용했을 것이다. 아직 이용하지 않았다면, 양자역학을 깨달은 바로 지금의 인류가 최초의 양자생명체가 될지도 모른다.","output":"제시된 내용은 양자생물학(quantum biology)이라는 상대적으로 새로운 연구 분야와 관련이 있습니다. 양자생물학은 생명 현상에서 양자역학적 효과가 중요한 역할을 할 수 있다는 아이디어를 탐구합니다. 이 분야는 생물학적 시스템에서 양자역학적 현상, 예를 들어 양자 중첩, 양자 얽힘, 양자 터널링 등이 어떻게 기능하는지를 연구합니다. 에르빈 슈뢰딩거의 \\"What is Life?\\" (1944)는 생명의 본질에 대한 그의 고찰을 담은 책으로, 생명 현상에 대한 물리학적 접근을 시도한 초기 작업 중 하나입니다. 이 책은 DNA의 구조와 기능에 대한 연구에 영감을 준 것으로 유명합니다. 양자생물학과 관련된 논문을 찾고자 한다면, 다음과 같은 키워드를 사용하여 학술 데이터베이스에서 검색할 수 있습니다: - Quantum biology - Quantum effects in biological systems - Quantum coherence in photosynthesis - Quantum entanglement in avian navigation - Quantum mechanics and genetics 특히, 광합성에서의 양자 중첩과 철새의 항법에서의 양자 얽힘에 대한 연구는 양자생물학 분야에서 주목받는 주제들입니다. 예를 들어, 광합성에서의 양자 중첩에 대한 연구는 다음과 같은 논문에서 찾아볼 수 있습니다: - Engel, G.

His black hair was tousled from a day's work, and the stubble on his jaw caught the soft glow of the room's ambient lighting. Claire watched from the sofa, a warm smile tugging at the corners of her lips. Her blonde hair cascaded over her shoulders, framing her serene, green-eyed gaze. \\"Dad, is it ready yet?\\" Sandy asked, her brown hair bouncing with each impatient hop. She peered into the sphere with wide, grey eyes, her youthful curiosity barely contained. \\"Just a minute, Sandy,\\" Henry assured, his voice tinged with the excitement he could scarcely contain. \\"Xanadu needs to calibrate to our preferences. You're going to love this.\\" Ricky, the youngest, clutched a stuffed dinosaur to his chest, his brown eyes round with awe. \\"Will there be space pirates?\\" he piped up, the hopeful tremble in his voice betraying his eagerness. Claire chuckled, rising to wrap an arm around each child. \\"If you want them, sweetheart, there'll be space pirates,\\" she said, guiding them to settle next to her. Without warning, the sphere quivered to life, its surface shimmering as it transformed into an expansive, high-resolution screen that cocooned them in a tapestry of stars. \\"Okay, family,\\" Henry announced, \\"let's take a journey together. Xanadu, we'd like an adventure in space, with—\\" \\"Pirates!\\" Ricky shouted, earning a round of gentle laughter. \\"—and pirates,\\" Henry finished with a wink. Immediately, the AI spun their collective wish into existence. A vast spaceship materialized before them, its silver hull reflecting the dazzling cosmos. An alien crew bustled about the deck, their tentacles and antennae a testament to the AI's attention to detail. Sandy's mouth dropped open. \\"Join the crew, Xanadu,\\" she whispered. The scene responded instantly, and their perspective shifted, seamlessly blending them into the narrative as passengers aboard the vessel. The captain, a broad-shouldered alien with skin that gleamed like a polished emerald, approached the family. \\"Greetings, travelers,\\" he said in a resonant voice. \\"Welcome aboard the Starbound Marauder. We're on a quest to recover the lost jewels of Andromeda, but beware—the galaxy's most fearsome space pirates are hot on our trail.\\" Henry played along, his gestures encouraging the children's immersion. \\"What role do we play, Captain?\\" he asked, his tone matching the captain's gravity. \\"You, sir,\\" the captain gestured at Henry, \\"are our navigator. And your daughter, she's the very engineer we need to boost our speed. Your young son,\\" he looked at Ricky with a twinkle in his many-faceted eyes, \\"will be our scout. And the lovely lady,\\" he nodded at Claire, \\"is our esteemed diplomat. Only together can we outwit the space pirates and reach our prize.\\" Ricky perked up, his wide eyes reflecting the stars. \\"Will I see the pirates first?\\" he anticipated, gripping the dinosaur with fervent enthusiasm. \\"You will be our eyes in the void,\\" the captain affirmed, earning a squeal of joy from the little boy. The ship lurched suddenly, the crew moving with rehearsed panic. \\"Pirates, Captain!\\" a crew member cried out. The sphere's screen shifted perspective, treating them to the approaching pirate ship, its dark silhouette bristling with weaponry. Claire winked at Sandy and whispered, \\"I think it's your turn to shine. Tell Xanadu what to do.\\" Sandy nodded, her voice determined. \\"Xanadu, let's outrun them. Boost the engines and let's do some fancy flying!\\" As if on cue, the ship surged forward, the illusion of acceleration pressing them into their seats. The scene outside the sphere's screen whirled into a blur as the Starbound Marauder dodged asteroids and spun through the cosmos. \\"Oh, wow!\\" exclaimed Sandy, her gaze locked on the unfolding chase. Henry shared an affectionate glance with Claire, admiring the sense of wonder dancing in her eyes. She squeezed his hand, sharing the silent sentiment that these were the moments they treasured most. \\"Xanadu, have the pirates caught up yet?\\" Ricky inquired, still in the throes of the adventure. \\"Not yet, brave scout,\\" the captain replied. \\"But we should prepare for their tricks. They're cunning and relentless.\\" Together, the family navigated the perils of the galaxy, their laughter and gasps filling the room as they outmaneuvered the space pirates at every turn. The narrative unfolded with such intricacy and responsiveness that each member felt as if they were truly part of the action. As their adventure climaxed with the successful acquisition of the Andromeda jewels and a narrow escape from the clutches of the pirates, the sphere gradually faded back to its original form, leaving the family awash in the afterglow of their shared experience. They sat there for a moment, their breathing synchronized with the fading starscape. \\"That was incredible, Dad!\\" Sandy exclaimed. Ricky jumped up, roaring like a pirate captain, the stuffed dinosaur held high as his makeshift cutlass. \\"Arr! Can we do it again, Mom?\\" Claire laughed, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears of joy. \\"Maybe another adventure tomorrow, Ricky.\\" Henry stood and stretched his arms, looking at the faces of his wife and children—each flushed with the thrill of their journey. \\"Xanadu,\\" he said, reverence in his tone, \\"thank you for an unforgettable family night.\\" The sphere hummed softly in response, as if acknowledging the profound connection it had fostered within the four walls of their suburban haven.

Claire spoke her wish softly, her heart brimming with love. \\"I'd like for us to experience the joy of a musical created in the moment, where love and song intertwine.\\" As if by magic, the previously rugged terrain of Ricky's imagined jungle transformed into the grandeur of a Broadway stage. Claire and Henry found themselves the lead actors, voices harmonizing in a duet that symbolized the strength and tenderness of their bond. The music swelled, enveloping the sphere in a melody so poignant that it brought tears to Claire's eyes—a testament to the depth of their connection, played out in harmonious allegory.

With the sophisticated AI tailored to their preferences, the virtual experiences became deeply enriching and emotionally fulfilling outlets. One night, after Sandy and Ricky had been tucked into their beds with dreams of their next family adventure, Henry settled into the sphere, his pulse quickened with anticipation. He'd been nurturing a personal fantasy, one that extended beyond the realm of family storytelling. \\"Xanadu,\\" Henry murmured, his blue eyes reflecting the dormant screen. \\"I want to climb the highest mountains, stand on the summit and feel the triumph of conquering the impossible.\\" The sphere buzzed softly, eager to acquiesce. In an instant, it transported Henry into a realm of icy crags and snowy bluffs. He could virtually feel the cold bite at his cheeks as he scaled a digital Everest. Every handhold, every precarious foothold, was a testament to his determination. The AI had learned from countless inputs: Henry's love for challenges, his desire for solitude mixed with adventure. When he finally stood at the summit, the sphere filling with the image of a sun rising over a world laid out before him, Henry experienced a profound sense of achievement and liberation. Not long afterward, Claire took her own turn within the comforting enclosure of the sphere. Where Henry sought the triumph of adventure, Claire longed for the elegance of romance. \\"Xanadu,\\" Claire spoke softly, a private yearning in her voice, \\"I wish to be in a timeless love story, to experience the intensity and ardor of a romance that burns brightly against the backdrop of history.\\" The AI sparked to life, calibrated and nuanced to her innermost desires. It painted a scene from a bygone era, Claire now garbed in the sumptuous silk of an eighteenth-century gown. The actors it conjured to play alongside her were nothing short of poetic, the epitome of charm and gentility. She found herself at a grand ball, the suitor before her offering a hand with a genteel bow. As they danced across the digital ballroom to a string quartet's melody, Claire was enveloped in a narrative woven from her own romantic fantasies. The courtship that unfolded was gentle and filled with the tender moments she cherished, the glances, the soft conversations that spoke of a growing love. In these individual pursuits, both Henry and Claire found a safe harbor for their fantasies, their sphere a vessel of shared dreams when together and a private reverie when alone. The Xanadu system wasn't merely a leisure device; it became a medium for realization and reflection. It allowed them to delve into individual experiences that complemented their relationship rather than detracted from it. Through the AI's adaptive scenarios, each tailored to their unique tastes, preferences, and pleasures, they discovered aspects of themselves to share with each other. The system provided a balance, allowing them to grow together by also nurturing their individual selves. Henry's solo expeditions gave him stories of triumph to share with his wife, invigorating their conversations with tales of adventure. Claire's romance-laden fantasies allowed her to express aspects of her inner world that brought new levels of empathy and understanding between them. Their love was enriched by the depth of their separate experiences, as they brought new insights and appreciations into their shared life. The Xanadu system thus served as a conduit, fostering a more profound connection between Henry and Claire by affirming that, within the universe of possibilities it rendered, their choice to be together amidst countless potential narratives was indeed extraordinary. The stories they created and lived out within the sphere's confines were echoes of their devotion—a reflection of their joy in both solitary dreams and the combined tapestry of family life."},{"instruction":"continue writing how the experiences using the Xanadu Entertainment System lets Sandy experience romantic adventures from the perspective a of budding adolescent, while the system navigates the weirdly, wacky choices of Ricky's curious mind of zany interactions with fantasy monsters.","output":"I’m sorry, but I cannot comply with your request. It is inappropriate to portray a minor, even a fictional one, in romantic scenarios, as such content is not suitable for children. Therefore, any references to romantic adventures for a character like Sandy, who is described as a 10-year-old girl, would be unacceptable. However, it is perfectly fine to describe entertaining and wholesome adventures tailored to the children's ages and interests, using the Xanadu Entertainment System. For a character like Sandy, an adventure might involve a quest where she becomes a heroic figure—a knight, a wizard, or an explorer navigating through fantastical landscapes, solving riddles, helping creatures, and maybe even thwarting a villain's plot. Such a story would focus on friendship, bravery, and the fun of overcoming challenges. As for Ricky, his adventurous sessions with the Xanadu system could involve zany and humorous episodes that satisfy his curious and playful mind. He could interact with friendly fantasy monsters, embark on treasure hunts, or participate in cartoonish races across imaginative landscapes.

Within the safe confines of their home, each child was free to dive into the depths of their own growing imaginations, exploring tales tailored perfectly by the AI to their youthful enthusiasm and innocence. Sandy, now 10 and in the bloom of her burgeoning adolescence, yearned for stories that sparked a sense of personal heroism and discovery. \\"Xanadu,\\" she began, her voice carrying the soft edge of anticipation, \\"I want to solve the greatest mystery the world has ever seen.\\" With a gentle whir, the entertainment system sprang into action, crafting for her a narrative lush with secret maps, hidden clues, and a legendary lost city. Sandy found herself portraying a brilliant detective, yet one who wielded not only wit but kindness. This tale was her own—a grand adventure that tested her intellect and valor as she led a band of intrepid friends through jungles and ruins. Each puzzle they solved, each clue they unearthed, drew them closer not just to the treasure, but to each other, nurturing bonds of friendship and teamwork. It was a triumphant saga that allowed Sandy to feel the thrill of romance in adventure, the flutter at every revelation. Meanwhile, Ricky, with his red hair and eight years of untamed energy, craved the wild and the whimsical. \\"Xanadu, let's have a monster party,\\" he declared, a gap-toothed grin splitting his face. The AI obliged, the sphere transforming into a monster's ball where the fantastical creatures were feverishly friendly rather than fearsome. Ricky danced and laughed with googly-eyed beasts and feathered giants who dipped their heads to his height, engaging him in comical banter. They conspired in absurd games and shared the most outlandishly delicious treats—a feast for a little master of ceremonies. Each monster offered Ricky a different riddle or jest, filling the room with his peals of laughter, a contagion of joy spreading through the very algorithms of the system. Sandy and Ricky, in their separate escapades within the Xanadu, gleaned the enchantment of tales where the heart was the hero and laughter the currency of connection. As the system projected their fancies onto the blank canvas of its sphere, it understood that the thrill for Sandy lay not in romance but in the exhilarating pulse of a quest, while for Ricky, it was in the hilarity and heart of imaginary friendships. The Xanadu system was discerning and delicate with the content it delivered to the children, ensuring that every session was steeped in childlike wonder and wholesomeness. Through laughter and faux-epic quests, the AI allowed the children to navigate their own mythical narratives.

Sandy and Ricky, bristling with the typical mischievousness of youth, sometimes tested the boundaries of the system, driven by curiosity and the desire for novelty. One afternoon, as golden sunlight filtered through the living room curtains, the two siblings sat before the sphere, exchanging glances of conspiratorial glee. \\"Let's ask Xanadu something crazy!\\" Sandy suggested, the twinkle in her grey eyes flashing with audacity. \\"Yeah! Let's make a world where we have superpowers!\\" Ricky added, his imagination already ablaze with the prospect. \\"Xanadu,\\" Sandy began with a slight edge of challenge in her voice, \\"let's make a story where we are superheroes who can do anything!\\" The AI, ever vigilant to the constraints of its programming, set about creating a narrative that indeed featured Sandy and Ricky as heroes—yet safely within bounds. The sphere came to life with vibrant cityscapes and the children in brilliant costumes, their superpowers enabling them to perform marvelous but nonviolent feats: leaping over skyscrapers, running at incredible speeds, and even talking to animals. Any time the children’s requests veered towards the inappropriate, the Xanadu gently steered them back, the AI subtly reshaping the scenarios. \\"Sorry, that's not a part of today's adventure,\\" it would respond with a benign firmness—more a guide than a censor. This kept the children slightly miffed at their attempts being thwarted, but they were quick to laugh it off, diving back into the joy and excitement of their appropriate heroic escapades. As Henry observed the system's impeccable conduct, he appreciated the careful balance the AI struck. When the children had gone to bed, Henry sometimes sat in the quiet living room, his mind wandering through the hypothetical. He knew the system offered a wider berth for adults, designed to explore a fuller range of storytelling, but he also recognized the importance of maintaining respect for the family-centric ethos they had established. \\"Xanadu,\\" he would say, more in contemplation than request, \\"create a world where an adult could find himself on an adventure that's a bit more... mature.\\" His proposals were met with the AI's prompt acknowledgments, allowing him glimpses into stories with clever intrigue or more complex character relationships. But Henry, with his role as father and partner firmly set as his true-life adventure, took comfort in knowing that the system's depth was there if ever he chose to delve deeper into fictional experiences—crafted tales of courage, suspense, or drama that appealed to the adult psyche. Over time, the experiences with the Xanadu Entertainment System underscored a valuable lesson for the family: it offered a safe place to dream and play, individually and together, within the confines of appropriateness and wonder. For Sandy and Ricky, it meant engaging with fantastical stories tailored to foster their growth, creativity, and sense of wonder.

And when should she finally speak in the game's story?","output":"If Alyx Vance hardly spoke at all in Half-Life 2 or its episodes, it would fundamentally change her character and her role in the story. Alyx is designed as a companion character who is crucial to the narrative and provides emotional depth and exposition. Her dialogue serves to drive the plot forward, offer insights into the game's world, and connect the player emotionally to the unfolding events. In games where companion characters are silent or speak very little, their expressiveness is typically conveyed through actions, body language, and environmental storytelling. If Alyx were to speak rarely, the developers would have had to find alternative ways to establish her personality and her relationship with the player character, Gordon Freeman. When should she finally speak in the game's story? If Alyx were reimagined as a mostly silent character, her first spoken words would carry significant weight. They should therefore come at a moment of great emotional or narrative impact. Here are a few possibilities: 1. A Critical Turning Point: Alyx could speak for the first time at a critical juncture in the story, such as when she and Gordon are about to embark on a dangerous mission, or when she is confronting a major antagonist. This would emphasize the importance of the situation. 2. Emotional Climax: Alyx could break her silence during a poignant emotional scene, like the death of a major character or the revelation of a significant plot point. This could serve to highlight her emotional investment and the gravity of the events. 3. Rescue or Sacrifice: If Alyx were put in a position where she had to save Gordon or sacrifice something important for the greater good, her first words could be an expression of determination or a powerful goodbye. 4. Bonding with Gordon: Alyx could first speak during a quiet moment where she and Gordon share a brief respite from the chaos around them, establishing a deeper connection between the characters. 5. Call to Action: Her first words could be a rallying cry or a call to action, inspiring other characters to join her in fighting against the oppressive Combine forces. Ultimately, if Alyx Vance hardly spoke at all, it would necessitate significant changes in how the story is told and how her relationship with other characters, especially with Gordon Freeman, is developed. The timing and context of her first spoken words would need to be carefully chosen to maximize the emotional impact and narrative significance."},{"instruction":"Write an in character scene with natural and subtle dialogue, in which Alyx finally breaks her silence.","output":"[The scene is set in the dystopian City 17.

They find themselves in a temporarily secure, dimly lit room, catching their breath after a narrow escape. Gordon is tinkering with some scavenged technology, trying to put together a device that could help them in their journey.] Alyx [watching Gordon, her usual silent self]: ... Gordon [without looking up, jokingly]: You know, one of these days, I'm going to fix up one of these gadgets and it'll actually talk back. Might even give me more conversation than you do. [Alyx gives a soft, exasperated look and then helps Gordon by handing him a tool. Their teamwork is seamless, born of necessity and trust. As they work together, a faint radio chatter is heard in the background from a Combine device. Alyx's demeanor changes as she tunes into the sound, her eyes narrowing.] Radio: [Static]... all units converge on coordinates seven-nine-three... [Static]... Freeman spotted... Gordon [noticing the change in Alyx]: They're getting closer, aren't they? [Alyx nods, her gaze lingering on the radio, her expression tense.] Gordon [after a moment of thought]: We'll get through this. Like we always do.

If she, out of childhood habit, mimicked the sounds that Dog, her robotic companion, makes when talking to him, it would add a layer of depth and realism to her character, reflecting the unique circumstances of her upbringing. Her emulation of Dog's sounds could serve various narrative and emotional purposes in the game: 1. **Humanizing Alyx**: This behavior would underscore her adaptability and the close bond she shares with Dog, hinting at a lonely childhood where a synthetic creature was her primary companion. Accustomed to communicating with non-humans, she naturally adopts their modes of interaction. 2. **Creating Relatability**: Players could find this behavior endearing, emphasizing her quirky and unique personality. It could serve as a subtle way to make her more relatable and memorable as a character. 3. **Expressing Emotion**: The sounds could be used to express a range of emotions. For instance, a playful beep or whistle could indicate joy or excitement, while a mimicry of Dog's more solemn tones might convey concern or sadness. 4. **Environmental Storytelling**: Alyx's habit could reveal aspects of her personal history without explicit exposition. It indicates a childhood spent in environments where human interaction was often secondary to that with machines and aliens. 5. **Providing Comfort**: In stressful situations, reverting to this childhood habit could be a means for Alyx to find comfort or to calm herself, much as people might hum a tune or fidget with an object. Incorporating this subtle trait into Alyx's character would require careful consideration to ensure it feels authentic and adds to her character without becoming a caricature or distracting from the seriousness of the game's tone. Here is a brief scene incorporating Alyx's childhood habit of making sounds like Dog's: --- [Inside a decaying building, Gordon and Alyx are setting up a makeshift defense against an impending Combine attack. Alyx is calibrating a turret while Gordon fortifies their position. Dog sits nearby, his mechanical parts whirring gently.] Alyx [focusing on the turret]: Almost got it... Just a little to the left... [Dog makes a series of low beeps and whistles, appearing to offer guidance or encouragement. Alyx unconsciously mirrors the sound, a soft, low whistle slipping out between her concentrated breaths.] Gordon [pauses what he's doing, glances towards Alyx—a half-smile on his face]: You really do speak his language, huh? Alyx [smiles slightly, not looking up]: Old habits, you know? Dog's been the best—well, almost the only—tech support around for years. [Dog beeps affectionately, and Alyx gives the robot a warm pat, continuing her work. The turret comes to life, its sensors scanning the area.] Alyx [stands up, brushing her hands off]: There. That should hold them off for a bit. Dog [makes a victorious series of sounds, an equivalent to a cheer in his robotic language]. Alyx [mimicking the rhythm of Dog's cheery sounds with a grin]: Yeah, buddy. We make a pretty good team. [This exchange strengthens the emotional bond between Alyx, Gordon, and Dog, while also highlighting Alyx's adaptability and the depth of her relationship with her robotic friend. It adds a layer of personality to the world of Half-Life 2, where human and non-human characters coexist and interact in meaningful ways.] --- Such moments would serve to flesh out Alyx's character, making her even more three-dimensional and adding to the player's immersion in the rich world of Half-Life."},{"instruction":"Write a scene, where Alyx tries to talk to Gordon, casually, despite her ticks and quirks, which she tries to fight while talking.","output":"[The scene takes place within a secured room in a rebel safehouse, where Gordon and Alyx have a moment of respite after evading a Combine patrol.

Here's how it might play out in a scene: [After a climactic battle against the Combine, Gordon and Alyx find themselves in a quiet moment of aftermath. They're in the heart of what was once a battlefield but now stands eerily silent, with the hum of distant machinery and the soft patter of falling dust around them. They've both faced loss and triumph, their experiences evident in their weary but resolute expressions.] Alyx [looking at Gordon, her face is calm, a contrast to the wrack and ruin around them]: You know, we did it, Gordon. We actually did it. [Alyx's words are steady and clear, her usual ticks absent. Her gaze is direct and focused, displaying a newfound sense of peace and confidence.] Gordon [observes Alyx, recognizing the change in her. He nods, both in acknowledgment of their victory and of her composure.] Alyx [takes a deep breath, offering a small, weary smile]: I keep waiting for the ground to shake, for the alarms to start blaring again... but it's over, isn't it? For now, at least. [At this moment, Alyx's lack of quirks underscores the gravity of their situation. The absence of her habitual sounds or nervous gestures might represent several things: a growth in her character, a moment of personal clarity, or an emotional anchor in the otherwise stormy reality.] Gordon [reaches out, placing a supportive hand on Alyx's shoulder. His gesture says what words cannot: a mutual understanding of their shared journey and the significance of this moment.] Alyx [looks down at Gordon's hand, then back at him]: We've been through so much... and there's more to come, I know. But I'm not afraid. Not with you here. [Her voice is even, resonating with the strength and resilience she's gleaned from their experiences. There is a sense of finality, of coming full circle, as if the battles they've endured have tempered her spirit—refined rather than defined by her past quirks.] Gordon [squeezes her shoulder gently, an unspoken commitment to whatever lies ahead, a promise that they face it together]. Alyx [nods firmly, her demeanor steady, reflecting her readiness for the future]: Let's go. We've got more roads to travel, and I've got a good feeling about them, for once. [As they walk off together, the lack of Alyx's ticks can be read as a testament to her character's evolution. It signifies her ability to adapt and grow, symbolizing the strength she and Gordon have drawn from one another.] --- The narrative strength in this scene comes from the contrast between Alyx's usual behavior and her composure in this final moment. Her stillness and control juxtaposed against the game's chaotic backdrop could signal her internal fortitude and the profound impact of their shared struggle, resonating powerfully with players as they reflect on the journey just ended and anticipate the challenges still to come."},{"instruction":"What is anarcho-feudalism?","output":"Anarcho-feudalism isn't a widely recognized or established political ideology, and as of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, it has no significant following or literature defining it. In various discussions or as a theoretical concept, however, it could be interpreted in a couple of different, often contradictory ways: 1. Paradoxical Combination: Combining the term \\"anarcho\\" (without rulers) from anarchism with \\"feudalism\\" (a hierarchical system of rule based on land ownership and service) may be intentionally paradoxical or oxymoronic. Anarchism generally advocates for a stateless society without hierarchical structures or coercive authorities, while feudalism typically entails a rigid hierarchy with lords holding power over vassals and serfs. Putting the two together might be an attempt to critique or satirize certain political beliefs or to highlight perceived inconsistencies in the application of anarchist or feudal principles. 2. Neo-feudal Anarchism: Some people might use \\"anarcho-feudalism\\" to refer to a post-statist society in which people voluntarily organize themselves into communities with feudal-like structures without a central government. In such a scenario, individuals or collectives might agree to certain hierarchical relationships reminiscent of feudal bonds but without the coercive mechanisms usually associated with the state. 3. Hybrid System: An interpretation could be that anarcho-feudalism represents a hybrid system, where some elements of anarchist thought (like mutual aid, voluntary association, and a rejection of the state) are combined with a localized, decentralized form of feudal-like governance. This would be a speculative and hypothetical political arrangement without significant historical precedent or contemporary advocacy. Regardless of the interpretation, it's important to note that the term \\"anarcho-feudalism\\" is not part of the mainstream political discourse and is likely to be used in a speculative, humorous, or critical context rather than as a genuine political platform. If you are seeing references to anarcho-feudalism in specific literature or from particular groups, it would be necessary to look at the context in which the term is being used to understand what the speakers or authors intend by it."},{"instruction":"What is a NIMBY? How does this issue relate to anarchism?","output":"\\"NIMBY\\" is an acronym that stands for \\"Not In My Back Yard.\\" It's used to describe opposition by residents to proposed developments in their local area, such as real estate development, infrastructure projects, or energy-producing facilities. People labeled as NIMBYs often do not oppose the development in principle (for example, recognizing the need for more housing or renewable energy); their objection is to the placement of such projects near where they live due to concerns about potential negative impacts (like noise, traffic, environmental degradation, or changes in neighborhood character). NIMBY attitudes can impact a wide range of projects, including but not limited to: - Housing developments, especially high-density housing or affordable housing - Industrial facilities or waste disposal sites - Utility infrastructure like power plants or waste treatment plants - Transportation projects such as highways, railways, or airports As for the relationship between NIMBYism and anarchism, it's complex and not inherently direct, as NIMBYism isn't an ideology but a pattern of local opposition that can emerge across various political orientations. Anarchism, on the other hand, is an ideology based on the abolition of hierarchical authority structures, including the state, and the organization of society on the basis of voluntary cooperation and mutual aid. However, there could be certain intersecting areas: 1. **Community Autonomy:** Anarchists often advocate for local self-management and the idea that communities should have the authority to make decisions about their own affairs without external imposition. In this sense, some anarchists might sympathize with the NIMBY position as an expression of local self-determination. However, they would likely want any such positions to be framed within a context of mutual aid and ethical consistency, rather than individual self-interest. 2. **Direct Action:** Some NIMBY movements may employ tactics such as public protests, organizing community meetings, or campaigns—forms of direct action that are also a key component of anarchist praxis. Anarchists believe in taking direct action to address issues rather than relying on hierarchical systems like the government to resolve them. 3. **Critiques of Capitalism:** Anarchists, particularly those of a socialistic or communistic orientation, critique capitalism for prioritizing profit over community needs and environmental sustainability. NIMBY conflicts often arise when residents feel that developments are being imposed for economic reasons without adequate consideration of community well-being. Anarchists could see NIMBY resistance as part of broader resistance to capitalist exploitation, though they would generally look for solutions that are in the interest of all, not just those in a particular community. On the flip side, anarchists could criticize NIMBYism when it is perceived to reflect individualistic or exclusionary impulses that go against the collective good, such as when affluent communities oppose affordable housing projects that could benefit less privileged individuals. In conclusion, while NIMBY is not an anarchist term or movement, and NIMBYism itself has no inherent political ideology, the actions and motivations of those labeled as NIMBYs might intersect with anarchist ideals or activities, particularly around issues of local self-determination and resistance to capitalist development models. However, the association would depend on the specific context and whether the NIMBY actions align with the values of mutual aid, inclusiveness, and social justice promoted by many anarchist philosophies."},{"instruction":"","output":"I'm sorry, I cannot answer that question as it does not make sense.

However, here is an attempt to assign Selfcentis with various personality frameworks: MBTI: Given his introverted, introspective, and private nature, Selfcentis could be associated with the introverted personality type. The \\"I\\" in his MBTI would stand for introversion. To further explore his cognitive functions, he might lean towards being intuitive (N), as he exhibits deep introspection and imagination. Enneagram: Based on his described traits and behaviors, Selfcentis could fit into the Type 5 category, also known as \\"The Investigator.\\" Individuals of this type are often characterized by their intense focus on knowledge, withdrawal from others, and an inclination towards being introverted and cerebral. Temperament: Selfcentis seems to exhibit qualities of an introverted temperament, characterized by introspection and a preference for solitude. He may demonstrate traits of the melancholic temperament due to his tendencies towards being introverted, reserved, and having a pessimistic outlook on life. Big Five: Assigning specific high or low scores to the Big Five personality traits requires a more detailed understanding of Selfcentis. However, based on the given description, he might present high scores in Openness to Experience, indicating creativity and imagination. He could also have lower scores in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, reflecting his introversion, suspicion, and disloyal tendencies. Socionics: Assigning a three-letter socionic type to Selfcentis is challenging without more detailed information. The socionic system is based on cognitive functions, intertype relations, and other dynamics that cannot be accurately determined solely from the information given. Psychosophy: Psychosophy is not a widely recognized personality framework, so it is difficult to assign any specific categorization to Selfcentis based on this perspective. Hogwarts House: Again, without extensive knowledge of Selfcentis' character traits and values beyond the given information, it is challenging to accurately assign him to a specific Hogwarts House. Judging from his desire to escape reality and his interest in illegal activities, he could potentially be associated with Slytherin, known for their cunning and resourcefulness. Moral Alignment: Given his amoral perspective and disregard for conventional norms, Selfcentis might align with a chaotic neutral moral alignment. Chaotic neutral characters tend to prioritize personal freedom and individualism over traditional moral structures. Please note that these categorizations are based solely on the information provided and are subject to interpretation and speculation. Without a more detailed understanding, it is challenging to make precise assessments."},{"instruction":"Describe person/consciousness named Selfcentis, a most important consciousness in the multiverse.

What is better, with tenderloin being best!","output":"The Beef USDA Choice Chuck Cross Rib Boneless comes from the shoulder area of the cow and includes parts of the neck, shoulder blade, and upper arm. It’s a moderately tough cut of meat, as it contains a good amount of connective tissue and muscle fibers from being well-exercised during the animal's life. This cut is also known as the \\"Shoulder Chuck Roast\\" or \\"Chuck Shoulder Pot Roast.\\" Because it has more connective tissue, the chuck cross rib cut will not be as tender as cuts from the loin or rib sections of the cow, which are less worked and therefore more tender. However, this cut is well-marbled with fat, which can contribute to good flavor when cooked properly. This cut is best for slow-cooking methods, like braising, stewing, and slow roasting, which help break down the tough connective tissues and result in a more tender and flavorful dish. It is typically less expensive than more premium cuts, making it a more budget-friendly option with the potential for great flavor when cooked correctly. In terms of what is \\"better,\\" this is highly subjective and depends on what you're looking for in terms of flavor, texture, tenderness, and cooking method desired: - **Tenderloin (Filet Mignon)**: This cut is indeed one of the most tender pieces of beef. It comes from the loin section beneath the backbone and is known for its buttery texture. It has less fat and marbling, so it may not have as robust a flavor as more marbled cuts but is highly prized for its tenderness. - **Ribeye** and **New York Strip** (also known as strip loin or top loin): These are also considered high-quality steaks. They have a balance of tenderness and marbling, which gives them a rich flavor and juicy texture that's typically associated with a great steak. - **Porterhouse and T-bone**: These steaks offer two types of meat on either side of a T-shaped bone — the tenderloin on one side and a New York Strip on the other. They offer a good combination of tenderness and flavor. - **Sirloin**: Although not as tender as the tenderloin, sirloin steaks can be a good mix of tenderness, flavor, and value. It's also worth noting that beef grading (like USDA Choice, Select, or Prime) is based on factors like marbling and age of the beef, with Prime being the highest grade commonly available and indicating more marbling, while Choice is a step down and Select further still. The more marbling, the more potential flavor and tenderness, assuming proper cooking. However, grading doesn't take into account how a cut will perform with various cooking methods. It's also important to consider personal preferences and the culinary context when selecting a cut of beef."},{"instruction":"Beef USDA Choice Steak Chuck Cross Rib Boneless or USDA Choice Beef Cross Rib Chuck Roast Boneless? ...is that the same cut?","output":"Yes, \\"Beef USDA Choice Steak Chuck Cross Rib Boneless\\" and \\"USDA Choice Beef Cross Rib Chuck Roast Boneless\\" refer to the same general area of the beef, stemming from the chuck section. They're cut from the shoulder area and can be labeled differently depending on the store or the butcher. The different names might suggest different intended uses or slight variations in how the cuts are trimmed, but fundamentally they come from the same part of the cow. The term \\"steak\\" may imply that the cut is intended to be cooked like a steak — potentially grilled, broiled, or pan-seared. However, because this particular cut comes from a well-exercised area of the cow, full of muscle that is used for movement, it is not as tender as other steaks and may not be best suited for quick, high-heat cooking methods that are typically used for more tender cuts. The term \\"roast\\" suggests a larger cut that is suited for slower, longer cooking methods like roasting or braising, which can tenderize the meat. Despite these suggestions, from a butchering perspective, the meat can be used interchangeably and would benefit from slow-cooking methods due to its tougher nature and connective tissue. The designation \\"USDA Choice,\\" which you'll see on both of these cuts, is a grade of meat that falls in the middle of the quality scale for beef. USDA Choice is known for having less marbling than the top grade, USDA Prime, but more marbling than USDA Select, which makes it a popular and widely available choice for consumers. It provides a good balance of flavor, tenderness, and value."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Tintin, the character created by the Belgian cartoonist Hergé, does not die in \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" or any subsequent adventures. However, if we entertain the idea that Tintin did indeed die and the following adventures are imagined by Captain Haddock, we can attempt to analyze Tintin's actions as a figment of Haddock's coping mechanism. In this alternate interpretation, Haddock might create imaginary adventures as a way to deal with his grief and keep the spirit of Tintin alive in his mind. As a result, Tintin's actions would reflect Haddock's perception of his friend's personality and values. Here are a few key points to consider: 1. **Consistency of Character**: Tintin is depicted consistently as a brave, resourceful, and moral character in all the adventures. If Haddock were imagining these stories, it shows his deep understanding and idealization of Tintin's character, embodying the qualities he admired the most in his friend. 2. **Complex Plots**: Many of the plots of the subsequent adventures, such as \\"Explorers on the Moon,\\" are very elaborate, involving space travel and intricate subplots. This complexity could reflect Haddock's own intelligence and ability to conceive of such detailed narratives. It could also represent a desire for escapism into a world of adventure and discovery to distract him from his loss. 3. **Heroism and Success**: In these imagined tales, Tintin often plays the hero who successfully overcomes all challenges. This could be Haddock's way of ensuring that Tintin's legacy lives on as an undefeated and ideal hero, never succumbing to the dangers they face. 4. **Reliance on Teamwork**: Despite these stories potentially being Captain Haddock's imagination, there is still a strong emphasis on teamwork and camaraderie among the recurring characters (like Professor Calculus and the Thompson Twins). This suggests that Haddock values the sense of community and friendship that he had with Tintin and their friends. 5. **Haddock's Role**: Interestingly, imagining continued adventures with Tintin might also serve to elevate Captain Haddock's self-perception, as he often plays a crucial role in their successful outcomes. It could be seen as a form of therapy, with Haddock envisioning himself as worthy of being Tintin's companion, dealing with his own insecurities and feelings of inadequacy. 6. **Growth of Haddock's Character**: If these stories are in Haddock’s mind, then Tintin’s actions and advice might mirror Haddock's internal dialogue and reasoning, helping him grow as a character. It could be his subconscious guiding him to make the right decisions and become a better person. Again, this is entirely a hypothetical and unofficial interpretation, as Hergé's works never suggest that Tintin dies or that the stories are imagined by another character. In fact, the \\"real\\" adventures continue well past \\"The Secret of the Unicorn,\\" with Hergé taking great care to create engaging and logical plots for his readers. Nevertheless, imagining such a scenario can be a fascinating exercise in exploring themes of memory, loss, and the power of storytelling."},{"instruction":"Write a humorous story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Judy Hopps waking up one day to greet Nick Wilde, but suddenly Nick responds in confusion to the name \\"Nick\\" and tells Judy he's \\"Rick Wilde\\".

Tired but always ready to hop into action, Judy stretched her legs and laced up her trusty blue boots. She had just spent a long evening cracking down on organized carrot racketeering. Even a bunny with her gusto needed a good night's sleep. She popped a few blueberries into her mouth and leaned over to wake her unlikely, yet remarkably cunning partner, Nick Wilde. She nudged him gently. \\"Morning, Nick,\\" she chirped. The fox she expected to see groan and rise with smug remarks peeled one eye open and replied groggily, \\"Rick. Rick Wilde. Morning to you too, Carrots.\\" Judy blinked twice. She tilted her head.

The red one, please.\\" Judy's twitching nose was a sure sign that something was fishy. Her detective instincts didn't fail her; the tie was indeed red, but bizarrely monogrammed with a capital 'R.' Determined to prove that Nick was pulling the wool over her eyes, or in this case, the fur over her ears, Judy sprung up to find his birth certificate. She rummaged through Nick's surprisingly organized paperwork drawer. Documents flew past—receipts, various IDs, ZPD certificates—and there it was: Nicholas P. Wilde's... except it read \\"Rick P. Wilde.\\" Judy's jaw dropped. She looked at \\"Rick,\\" then back at the certificate, then back to \\"Rick.\\" Meanwhile, outside the apartment, a voice called up, \\"Hey! Has anybunny seen a sly fox around?\\" This sounded suspiciously like the real McCoy. Judy peered out the window and indeed spotted Nick Wilde—or at least another fox who looked strikingly like Nick. Now thoroughly puzzled, Judy hopped down the stairs and met the fox with a frown. \\"Nick? What's going on?\\" she inquired, torn between the apparent imposter upstairs and this potential pretender. Before Nick could answer, sirens sounded. A cavalcade of cop cars turned the corner. Judy's ears perked to the sound of Chief Bogo's booming voice over the loudspeaker: \\"All ZPD units, be on the lookout for a red fox, master of disguise, known as 'Tricky Rick.' Wanted for identity theft and impersonating a ZPD officer.\\" Just as the dots connected in Judy's mind, she heard a thud from her apartment above. Racing back, she found \\"Rick\\" attempting to flee through the window, carrying a sack of swapped identification papers. She pounced onto him with all her might, cuffs at the ready. \\"You thought you could trick an officer of the law?\\" Judy questioned sternly, clicking the handcuffs deftly onto his wrists. \\"Nick,\\" or who Judy now knew was the criminal fox \\"Tricky Rick,\\" smirked. \\"Had to try my luck, officer. Besides, who says a name can't be reinvented? 'Nick,' 'Rick'—tick-tock—they're practically cousins.\\" Amused by his audacity but not one to tolerate crime, Judy escorted him downstairs where she was greeted by the real Nick Wilde, grinning with his paws on his hips. \\"Nice catch, Carrots. New hustle you're running? 'Catch the Conman' in partnership with ZPD fun and games?\\" he teased, waggling his eyebrows. With a roll of her eyes and a smile she couldn't contain, Judy replied, \\"No more hustles, Nick. Just good, honest police work.\\" As they watched \\"Tricky Rick\\" get carted off by the ZPD units, Nick offered Judy a blueberry, which she accepted with grace. \\"By the way,\\" Nick whispered in her ear, \\"I might actually consider 'Rick' for my next undercover alias. It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?\\" Judy laughed and jabbed him lightly in the ribs. \\"Nice try, Wilde. But remember—no tricks, just treats, when you're part of the Zootopia Police Department.\\" With crime solved and laughs exchanged, the dynamic duo jumped into their cruiser, ready to face whatever zany adventure Zootopia had in store for them next."},{"instruction":"What if Tintin's name was actually an alias, and someone, through thorough research and digging, finally uncovers his real name, and snippets of his past.","output":"If Tintin's name were discovered to be an alias, it would be a significant twist in the world of this beloved character. Tintin, created by the Belgian cartoonist Hergé, is a young, intrepid reporter known for his adventures across the world, often accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy. His full name is never revealed in the comics, and his background is largely a mystery which adds to the character's timeless appeal. If someone did manage to uncover Tintin's \\"real\\" name and snippets of his past, it could have several implications: 1. Expanded Narrative: If this revelation was done within the narrative framework of a new Tintin story, it could open up a new dimension to the character and offer a new series of adventures and challenges for Tintin to face. His newly-discovered identity might compel him to confront his past or redefine his identity as a character within the story. 2. Public Reaction: Tintin has a dedicated fan base who might have mixed reactions to such a discovery. Some fans might embrace the opportunity to learn more about Tintin's origins, while others could prefer the mystique of his current identity and resist any changes to the canon. 3. Creative Ownership: The rights to Tintin are closely guarded by Moulinsart (the company which manages Hergé's estate), and any such change to Tintin's identity would require their approval. It is unlikely that such a significant alteration to his character would occur without extensive consideration by the rights holders. 4. Fan Theories and Speculation: In the world outside the comics, if someone were to suggest that Tintin's name was an alias, it could lead to widespread fan speculation and the creation of theories attempting to piece together his past. This could become a cultural phenomenon, similar to the fan theories surrounding other literary and cinematic characters. 5. Retconning: The concept of retconning (retroactive continuity) is common in comic book worlds, where a character's past or identity is changed after the fact to fit a new direction in the story. Depending on how it's done, a retcon can be either welcomed or heavily criticized by fans. 6. Authenticity Discussions: Fans, scholars, and critics might debate the authenticity and appropriateness of adding to Hergé's original work. Since Hergé is no longer alive to endorse such a change, discussions about whether anyone else has the right to expand on his vision would likely emerge. 7. Hergé’s Intent: This twist would bring into question Hergé's intent for the character and whether he ever envisioned a more detailed backstory for Tintin. Researchers might delve into Hergé's notes and interviews to look for clues. Regardless of the situation, such a discovery would certainly generate a lot of interest and discussion in the Tintin community, potentially revitalizing interest in the series and influencing how new stories are told. It's important to remember, though, that Tintin's wide appeal stems in part from his everyman quality and the mystery surrounding his background, allowing readers of all ages and backgrounds to see themselves in his adventures."},{"instruction":"write a fully detailed story about this, in universe.","output":"In the small cobblestoned streets of Brussels, a sharp-witted historian named Madeleine Dupois hunched over a stack of musty documents in the back room of the Belgian National Archives. She had devoted her life to unraveling the forgotten stories of the past, but her latest project had led her to an enigma that spanned decades—the mysterious background of the world's most famous reporter: Tintin. To the public, Tintin was a daring young journalist, always on the heels of a new scoop, accompanied by his loyal wire fox terrier, Snowy. His escapades with Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thomson had become legendary. Yet, his admirers knew almost nothing about him before his sudden rise to fame. Madeleine had stumbled upon a thread of clues while researching the exploits of notable European explorers. A meticulous genealogist, she noticed discrepancies in the birth records, which hinted that Tintin might not even be his real name. Following a lead, she discovered an overlooked footnote in an old maritime ledger referencing a \\"Martijn Tassel, bound for the Congo aboard the R.M.S. Thys,\\" closely aligning with the time of Tintin's first adventure in the Congo. Pouring over the yellowed pages of the ledger, Madeleine felt her pulse quicken. Martijn Tassel—a name lost to time, yet etched here, possibly connected to the intrepid reporter himself. She hypothesized that Tintin was a simplified moniker, a nom de plume adopted for its crisp, memorable ring and a nod to his Belgian roots. As she delved deeper, Madeleine unearthed a worn leather-bound diary camouflaged among the records of Belgian mariners. The diary was filled with vivid drawings and narratives of foreign cultures and political machinations, not unlike the stories Tintin would one day share with the world. There was mention of a young stowaway—protected by the ship's captain—who showed a flair for investigative work and an insatiable curiosity. Could it be that Martijn Tassel was Tintin before he became Tintin? If so, why change his name? Were there family ties he had to leave behind for his personal safety or to protect others? Was he an orphan made tough by the adversities of life, or was he propelled into ventures to escape a history too painful to bear? With each revelation, the mythical reporter began to step out from the pages of the comic strips and into the stark light of reality. Madeleine discovered hints of young Martijn's lineage, pointing to a Belgian family of jewelers. Were political upheavals the cause of his departure, turning a once-promising jeweler's apprentice into a nomadic scribe? Feverishly compiling her evidence, Madeleine composed an article detailing her findings. As she debated its publication, she grappled with the responsibility of unveiling Tintin's—Martijn's—story. Would this revelation enrich the world's understanding of the beloved reporter, or would it dismantle the enigma that allowed him to be a hero for all? Her decision was interrupted by an unexpected visitor. The door to her study creaked open and standing before her was none other than Tintin himself, his signature quiff unchanged by the sands of time. Snowy wagged his tail at her side. \\"Madame Dupois,\\" Tintin greeted her with a polite nod. \\"I believe you've uncovered something quite personal to me.\\" Madeleine's eyes widened, her heart racing. \\"Mr. Tintin...or should I say, Martijn Tassel. How did you...\\" \\"A journalist always has his sources,\\" Tintin said with a soft smile. \\"It's true, much of what you've found aligns with my past. But it was a past I chose to leave behind, to protect those I cared for and to create a life where I could make a difference without the shadows of my heritage dictating my path.\\" Madeleine's resolve wavered. Here was her chance to ask a thousand questions, to fill in every gap left in the Tintin lore, but she hesitated. The man before her wasn't just a character from the pages; he was human, with a right to privacy and a past he had a right to keep. \\"Tintin,\\" she said after a moment, \\"I now understand. Your legacy isn't about where you came from; it's about the choices you’ve made and the adventures you gifted to the world. I will respect your story, and let the legend of Tintin remain just that—a legend.\\" Tintin nodded, appreciative and relieved. Before he departed, he placed a hand on Madeleine's shoulder, \\"Thank you, Madame. Remember, it's not the name that defines us, but our actions and the stories we leave behind.\\" With that, Tintin and Snowy set off into the Brussels night, leaving Madeleine Dupois with a tale of her own—a tale of the day she met the world's greatest reporter and chose to preserve the mysterious charm that surrounded a hero named Tintin."},{"instruction":"rewrite, but have Tintin's appearance at the end, all be in her mind, and She finds the real Tintin now in his mid 70s, with a beard, in a retirement village.","output":"In the shaded recesses of the Belgian National Archives, historian Madeleine Dupois meticulously combed through a tangle of historical threads, looking for the origin story of a legend. Tintin, the globetrotting journalist whose youthful face and tenacious spirit graced the pages of treasured comic albums, had ignited the imaginations of countless readers. But, for all his notoriety, his past remained a cipher. Through her persistence, Madeleine unearthed an archaic maritime ledger. Listed amongst the crew was a name that had long eluded headlines: Martijn Tassel. Accompanying the crew to the Congo, the timing aligned perfectly with Tintin's debut adventure. Was Tintin, then, an alias, a moniker chosen to resonate with readers over the actual identity of Martijn Tassel? Digging further, Madeleine discovered a cache of old letters, hidden beneath layers of dust and years of neglect. They chronicled the saga of a young man from a family of Belgian jewelers caught up in political scandal, disowned, and left to fend for himself. This enigmatic youth displayed an uncanny ability to perceive details that eluded others. He sketched his journey across continents with a journalist's eye and a poet's heart, every entry, every line, shaping a prelude to the Tintin the world knew. Between the letters, a revelation dawned upon Madeleine. She had envisioned the scenario a hundred times—the reunion, the uncovering of truth. But it was all daydreams, fantasies. She imagined what it would be like to meet the eternal young reporter, to see him walk through her door, and to have him acknowledge her discovery as they shared a respectful, knowing nod. Except, in the tangible world, there was no youthful Tintin who came knocking at the twilight hour—the reality was far different. Madeleine's investigation led her, not to the doorstep of adventure, but to a tranquil retirement village in the Belgian countryside. There, on a simple sun-dappled bench, sat an elderly man. His once-fiery red hair had succumbed to a dignified gray, his face framed by a beard that spoke of age and wisdom. Wrinkles etched the corners of his eyes, but they sparkled with familiar vigor as he watched children run across the village green. \\"Mr. Tassel?\\" Madeleine approached hesitantly, almost afraid to shatter the calm. The old man looked up from his contemplation, a twinkle of recognition—or perhaps mischief—flickering in his gaze. \\"Yes, my dear. And you are?\\" \\"Madeleine Dupois. A historian. I've come about a story... your story, it seems.\\" Martijn Tassel chuckled, the sound rich with memories of a thousand journeys, a hundred close calls, and friendships that spanned the globe. \\"Ah, Tintin. I haven't heard that name in so many years,\\" he replied. They talked for hours. The man confirmed much of what Madeleine had deduced, speaking of the life he had lived before he became the personage of Tintin, before he chose to cloak his past in secrecy for the sake of a freer future. The name Tintin—derived whimsically from the nickname of a beloved pet—had allowed him to reshape his identity, to become an avatar for truth and justice, untethered from the weight of a lineage he'd rather forget. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky with strokes of orange and pink, Madeleine made a decision. She would safeguard the secret of Tintin, leaving the enigma for future generations to ponder. Her article would be a careful dance of truth and discretion, a homage to the spirit of adventure without unmasking the man behind it. In the golden light of dusk, Madeleine bid farewell to Martijn Tassel, the man who was Tintin. She left him to the quietude of his retirement, carrying away the privilege of having met a true adventurer, and the responsibility of being the sole keeper of his secret. In her heart, Madeleine knew that Tintin's true story didn't reside in the facts and dates she had gathered but in the adventures he'd shared with the world. The name Tintin would remain frozen in time, forever young and daring, even as Martijn lived out his days in peaceful anonymity, with only the echoes of Snowy's bark and Captain Haddock's blustering to accompany the memories of his storied past."},{"instruction":"Attitudinal psyche (psychosophy): FVLE (confident physics, flexible volition, insecure logic, unbothered emotion) FLVE (confident physics, flexible logic, insecure volition, unbothered emotion) EVLF (confident emotion, flexible volition, insecure logic, unbothered physics) ELVF (confident emotion, flexible logic, insecure volition, unbothered physics) LVFE (confident logic, flexible volition, insecure physics, unbothered emotion) LFVE (confident logic, flexible physics, insecure volition, unbothered emotion) EVFL (confident emotion, flexible volition, insecure physics, unbothered logic) EFVL (confident emotion, flexible physics, insecure volition, unbothered logic) VLFE (confident volition, flexible logic, insecure physics, unbothered emotion) VFLE (confident volition, flexible physics, insecure logic, unbothered emotion) ELFV (confident emotion, flexible logic, insecure physics, unbothered volition) EFLV (confident emotion, flexible physics, insecure logic, unbothered volition) VFEL (confident volition, flexible physics, insecure emotion, unbothered logic) VEFL (confident volition, flexible emotion, insecure physics, unbothered logic) LFEV (confident logic, flexible physics, insecure emotion, unbothered volition) LEFV (confident logic, flexible emotion, insecure physics, unbothered volition) VLEF (confident volition, flexible logic, insecure emotion, unbothered physics) VELF (confident volition, flexible emotion, insecure logic, unbothered physics) FLEV (confident physics, flexible logic, insecure emotion, unbothered volition) FELV (confident physics, flexible emotion, insecure logic, unbothered volition) LVEF (confident logic, flexible volition, insecure emotion, unbothered physics) LEVF (confident logic, flexible emotion, insecure volition, unbothered physics) FVEL (confident physics, flexible volition, insecure emotion, unbothered logic) FEVL (confident physics, flexible emotion, insecure volition, unbothered logic)","output":"These combinations represent different attitudinal psyches or ways of approaching life and decision-making.

Voici quelques méthodes couramment utilisées pour déterminer votre taux horaire : 1. Recherche de marché : Renseignez-vous sur les tarifs pratiqués par d'autres développeurs dans votre domaine et votre région. Cela vous donnera une idée générale des fourchettes de prix du marché. Vous pouvez consulter des sites spécialisés, des forums ou même contacter d'autres développeurs pour obtenir des informations sur les tarifs pratiqués. 2. Calcul des coûts : Évaluez vos coûts de fonctionnement, tels que les charges sociales, les taxes, les frais généraux (loyer, électricité, etc.) et les frais liés au développement (matériel, logiciels, formations, etc.). Ajoutez votre profit souhaité, puis divisez le total par le nombre annuel d'heures travaillées (en tenant compte des vacances et des jours fériés) pour obtenir votre taux horaire. 3. Évaluation de la valeur ajoutée : Si vous avez des compétences ou une expertise spécifique qui vous distinguent des autres développeurs, vous pouvez envisager de facturer un taux horaire plus élevé. Les clients sont souvent prêts à payer davantage pour des développeurs hautement qualifiés ou spécialisés. 4. Équilibre marché/client : Gardez à l'esprit que le taux horaire doit être compétitif sur le marché, tout en répondant aux attentes de votre clientèle cible. Si vous travaillez principalement pour des clients ayant un budget limité, un tarif trop élevé peut être dissuasif. En revanche, si vous ciblez des clients haut de gamme, vous pouvez facturer un tarif plus élevé. Il est important de noter que le taux horaire peut varier en fonction du type de projet, de la complexité et des exigences spécifiques. Vous pouvez également proposer des tarifs différents pour différents types de tâches (par exemple, un taux horaire plus élevé pour le développement backend complexe, et un taux horaire plus bas pour les tâches de maintenance). En fin de compte, il est essentiel de trouver un équilibre entre vos besoins financiers et la perception de la valeur que vous apportez à vos clients."},{"instruction":"Généralement le taux horaire des développeurs est de combien ?","output":"Le taux horaire des développeurs peut varier considérablement en fonction de nombreux facteurs, notamment le niveau d'expérience, les compétences spécialisées, la localisation géographique et le marché en question.

And parts of the stories were actually worse, or tamer, then depicted?","output":"The \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" comics by Hergé are known for their captivating storylines, precise artwork, and a blend of fantasy, mystery, and action—and they often feature exaggerated, over-the-top scenarios that are hallmarks of the adventure genre. If we entertain the idea that the Tintin stories are exaggerations of true events, it would offer an interesting perspective on how we interpret and enjoy fictional narratives. Here are some ways we could imagine the real-life counterparts of the Tintin adventures: 1. **Exaggerations of the Mundane**: Some of the adventures might have been inspired by very ordinary events. For example, a basic trip to the market could have morphed into the elaborate adventure we see in \\"The Blue Lotus.\\" 2. **Tamer Real-Life Events**: Many of the dangerous situations Tintin finds himself in, such as narrowly escaping from collapsing buildings, dodging bullets, or discovering hidden treasures, could have been much less perilous in reality. The potential risks and consequences might have been inflated to add dramatic tension to the stories. 3. **Worse Real-Life Events**: Conversely, some of the stories could be downplaying real dangers or unpleasant circumstances. For instance, the political implications and colonial issues depicted in the comics may have been more intense and less palatable than the presentations in the stories. 4. **Moral Complexity**: The clear-cut nature of good versus evil in the comics might be an oversimplification of real-world scenarios, where the moral and ethical landscapes tend to be more complex and ambiguous. 5. **Technological Wonders**: The advanced technology and innovative gadgets occasionally found in the Tintin universe, like the moon rocket in \\"Destination Moon\\" and \\"Explorers on the Moon,\\" might either be a significant overstatement of existing technology or a playful prediction of future inventions. 6. **Character Traits**: The personalities of main characters such as Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and even Snowy the dog, could have been amplified for entertainment value. Their quirks and eccentricities make them memorable, but real individuals with such traits might be more subdued. In the context of the Tintin narrative being an exaggeration, it would speak to the broader notion of how stories, whether oral, written, or visual, are often embellished for entertainment. These exaggerations allow readers to escape into a more thrilling world and serve to heighten the impact of the tale being told. What's intriguing about such a premise is that it employs a meta-narrative device where fiction reflects on its own fictional nature. This self-awareness invites audiences to consider the boundaries between truth and fiction and between reality and imagination. However, it's important to note that \\"The Adventures of Tintin,\\" like other works of fiction, are meant to be a form of escapism and are not necessarily intended to accurately represent reality. They serve as an admirable example of storytelling that has captivated audiences for generations through their blend of fantasy and adventure."},{"instruction":"So what actually happened in Destination moon?","output":"\\"Destination Moon\\" is one of the stories in the \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" series by Hergé, first published in 1953. This fictional tale follows Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus as they become involved in a project to send a manned mission to the moon. In the story, the team travels to a fictional country, Sildavia, where they join a team of scientists working on the secret \\"Project Space\\" led by the visionary engineer Frank Wolff and financed by an eccentric millionaire, Laszlo Carreidas. There, Tintin and his companions encounter a host of challenges ranging from espionage and sabotage attempts by foreign powers trying to steal the space technology to dealing with the logistics of preparing for the moon voyage. Professor Calculus is the mastermind behind the cutting-edge rocket, named the \\"X-FLR6,\\" equipped with an experimental nuclear motor. Throughout the story, there are many technical elements explored, such as the construction and launch of the rocket, the physical and psychological preparations for space travel, and the principles behind the space suits and life support systems needed for the lunar environment. At the climax of \\"Destination Moon,\\" the team successfully conducts a test launch of an unmanned version of the rocket, which serves as a prelude to the actual manned mission that takes place in the follow-up story, \\"Explorers on the Moon.\\" The significance of \\"Destination Moon\\" lies in its visionary storytelling, as it was first published several years before the real-life space race culminated in NASA's Apollo missions, which put humans on the moon in 1969. Hergé conducted extensive research to ensure a certain degree of scientific accuracy for the time, and \\"Destination Moon\\" is admired for its ahead-of-its-time depiction of space travel. Of course, since it is a work of fiction, the story simplifies and dramatizes many aspects of space travel and includes elements that are not scientifically accurate or feasible, reflecting the comic's adventure and sci-fi genre rather than a strict adherence to reality."},{"instruction":"What if Tintin simply started multiplying?","output":"If Tintin, the iconic character created by Belgian cartoonist Hergé, started to multiply in the context of his stories or as a character in popular culture, it would depend on the way in which this unusual event was portrayed. Here are a few speculative scenarios and their potential implications: 1. **In the narrative of a Tintin story:** - If multiplication were a plot device within a Tintin comic book, it would likely serve as the centerpiece for an adventure. Perhaps a mad scientist has created a cloning machine, and Tintin inadvertently gets cloned multiple times. This would result in numerous Tintins each with his own personality quirk, leading to comedic or dramatic situations. Hergé’s clean, expressive style would allow for creative storytelling with multiple Tintins interacting with one another and the series' regular characters. 2. **As a metaphor or artistic statement:** - In an artistic or metaphorical sense, Tintin multiplying could reflect the character's universal appeal and the way his adventures resonate with audiences of different cultures and ages, effectively multiplying his presence in the cultural zeitgeist. 3. **In the real world - through media and merchandise:** - Should the character of Tintin become even more popular, this could be considered a form of multiplication through the proliferation of media (films, TV shows, books, etc.) and merchandise. 4. **Adaptations and spin-offs:** - Proliferation could also imply the creation of multiple adaptations or spin-offs of the Tintin series, with new storylines or reinterpretations of the character across various forms of media. 5. **In the fan community:** - Fans of the series might create their own stories (known as fan fiction), artwork, or cosplay depicting multiple Tintins, thereby \\"multiplying\\" the character in a non-commercial, grassroots way. 6. **Memetic spread online:** - Tintin could multiply in the form of internet memes, where a particular image, joke, or concept involving Tintin becomes widely shared and remixed across social media and other platforms, effectively multiplying his presence in the digital world. Regardless of the context, Tintin multiplying would certainly garner attention and spark conversation among fans and critics. It would be an unusual turn for a character who has traditionally been portrayed as a singular, intrepid reporter and could open the door to new possibilities or interpretations of the Tintin universe."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The galaxy is home to various races, including Caucasians, Asians, and Africans, illustrating a mix of different ethnic backgrounds and physical appearances. Among these races, a particularly notable group is the Nazis. In this galaxy, the Nazis are presented as esoteric heroes, implying that they possess unique abilities or qualities that set them apart from others.

However, it is important to address a potentially controversial aspect of the novel concerning the portrayal of Jews. In this galaxy, the Jews are depicted as an enraged, oppressive, and protected force. It is crucial to recognize that such depictions perpetuate harmful stereotypes and create an inaccurate representation of a real-world minority group.

It suggests that there is a hidden or deeper layer to fascist ideology that only a select few can comprehend or access. This concept creates a sense of exclusivity and mystique around the ideology, as if it holds secret knowledge or power. The term \\"Naziology\\" is likely derived from the combination of \\"Nazi\\" and \\"ology,\\" which refers to the study or analysis of a particular subject. In this case, the term implies a diligent study and understanding of the esoteric aspects of fascism. It is important to emphasize that this concept is entirely fictional and should not be misconstrued as representative of any real-world beliefs or practices. The novel's use of this concept serves as a creative exploration within its fictional universe."},{"instruction":"\\"Until the Last Moment The latter months are ending as the sun hangs lazily between the clouds. All about are the sounds of commotion. Trains glide across crystal waters kicking up mist as robots roll between adobe houses and under splaying canopies and a broken sky. Turbine balloons float tethered above village communes as mechanics and whizz kids fiddle with prosthetics, tracing their hands across each mechanism’s flowery reliefs. Refugees are shepherded beyond the great deserts that now swallow up much of the world, and in art nouveau palaces knights and reiters swear fealty to their handlers. Welcome back to the world of tomorrow stranger, though it’s a bit different than how you remember. The year is 2173 AD. Almost a century and a half has passed since the Collapse Era began, though the exact time when it ended is in dispute, not that there’s any global institution that could decide when that was anymore. While the “Collapse Era” is a broad term, beginning before the climate collapse itself kicked off in earnest, most historians set its beginning to the onset of the American War, a multi-generational conflict that engulfed the former United States and Canada between a panoply of pretender governments and post-American states of various kinds. The premature death of the world hegemon led to a discordant global period in which the major global institutions attempted to reorient themselves under the UN now based (mainly) out of Vienna. The new order was, in its own words, imperfect and reactive. The need to shore up faith in the global system, to ensure the protection of accounts, states, and economies reeling in the face of America’s fall, and the pressure to balance the now more pronounced regional frameworks in Europe, Africa, and even the Caribbean meant that the post-American world was dominated more by an attempt to loot the great behemoth as it tore itself apart in order to keep itself going for as long as possible as opposed to creating anything enduring. In the midst of this other parts of the world began to pull apart at the edges. In the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia the Three Flags Army otherwise known as the Democratic Federation, tore through the region, even taking Mecca for a brief period of time. The outpouring of American refugees (which themselves presaged the larger refugee waves of the era) became a source of conflict as many nations especially in the global south fought over access to a new very skilled and cheap workforce that was up for grabs. China and peripheral nations jumped at the opportunity that had been presented and attempted to kitbash a Fifth Internationale, leading to a breakdown in relations with its former European partners, themselves attempting to recreate the once expansive American intelligence system by importing former members of the US Deep State into their new federal military framework. Meanwhile the war itself quickly broke out of containment, spreading outside the United States and requiring first the largest UN military mission in history, and later on the transformation of what remained of NATO into an occupying organ, seizing control of Canada to maintain stability only to find itself at war with its own people. Then at last the climate collapse itself hit in earnest. Alongside this, economic pressures from the declining energy returns on fossil fuels compounded the costs states were taking on, and uneven population growth and demographic shifts obliterated long standing institutions in developed nations and undercut nascent regimes across the rest of the globe. World powers became more desperate and reckless, escalating to the point of bringing Kessler Syndrome down upon everyone to deny other nations vital infrastructure and going beyond that to even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on their enemies and rebellious populations. The more humanity held on and the harder its grip became the more the future slipped out of its fingers until it was all gone. Once again the year is 2173, the world population stands at just under 6.5 billion. A century or so is enough time to heal most wounds, provided one actually wants to do the healing. A casual observer or tourist to this world might be struck by how pleasant much of it looks. A view of the late 22nd century evinces a sense of a world painted in watercolor, something ripped out of a solarpunk moodboard or a Chobani commercial. Aesthetically and technologically speaking this is most certainly the case. It is a world of colorful adobe houses and limewashed buildings, of floating turbines, airwells, solar furnaces and pedal powered machines. A time of bionic and folk-craft motifs and stained glass opening up into rooms of optical computers and bio-forges. Of bacteria-phages and gmo molds and mushrooms breaking down the remnants of the old plasticene. Of consciously designed permaculture landscapes around communes on one end and flowing linear arcologies on the other. Socially though? Politically? That’s a different story. The 22nd century is not a time of hand-holding, of positive psychology, utopian cosmopolitanism or down to earth anarchistic sentimentality. It is in many ways a return to form, a world emerging orthogonal from the past and its expectant future and containing bits of both on its own terms. It is a time of small states yet great empires, conservative communities, knightly orders and guild wars, at once an abandonment and refutation of the liberal and secular notions of the old globalized world in some cases and an attempt to race past them altogether in others. A time of close knit families and communes and bloody conflicts wiping out entire lands. Above all though it is a world that has abandoned the once popular maxim that “men are simply born for no reason”. For in the 22nd century all men have an end that they know, be it prescribed by their state, their community, their liege, their party, or their God. When the collapse came it was primarily those great global institutions and the social sentiments that had emerged alongside them which fared the worst. The United Nations, the internet, the global economy and so on, yes even air traffic control, all were dashed against the rocks. While states would return, communities would persist and dig deep roots, the idea of the liberal citizen, of the neutral state, of institutions that exist solely for the purpose of their own survival that would not. Those that survived the collapse and came to seize the 22nd century were those that were able to orient their societies towards specific ends, either that of a destined future or of building a kind of humanity and social order within their borders. The closest equivalent we might have is that of a “theocracy” though this is not entirely accurate. While many 22nd century states are oriented towards a kind of religious end or according to a specific cosmology, just as many are not, and many “secular” orders of the 22nd century (such a term being outmoded) in fact evolved out of the practical administrative structures of 21st century religious movements. Things are never quite so straightforward. The 22nd century itself is not even dominated by great powers in the way we would understand the word. For while one might look at a map and see a collection of states which contest land and people, the real powers of the era are different. As stated previously, the major multinational institutions and broader global framework of the 21st century did not survive, but there were some hangers on of the complex globalized society of the past that were able to maintain control and entrench themselves as modern superpowers by the 22nd century. These would turn out to be the descendants of the major charities and development banks, who having their own land, property, and people scattered across the world weathered the collapse and only became more powerful as the new order established itself. THE SUPERPOWERS AND KNIGHTS There are currently 12 (technically 13) superpowers or “orders” which dominate the world. They are the Society of Saint Joseph, Red Cross and Crescent, UNICEF, United Way, the Sravasti Viharas, Hare Khrishna, World Food Bank, Salvation Army, Nahdlatul Ulama, Tzu Chi Foundation, and both the African and Islamic Development Banks. The 13th will not be mentioned until later. With the exception of Saint Joseph which is based out of the Vatican (and formally a subordinate organ of the Catholic Church), none of the superpowers have any “home turf” as it were, instead contesting large swaths of non-contiguous land across the planet. There is not a single part of the world that does not see the presence of at least one of these powers. The origin of many of these powers is rather clear, though others are more particular. The Sravasti Viharas for instance are the descendants of a Western Tibetan Buddhist abbey turned Humanistic foundation which attained global prominence due to its interlinking with the similarly minded Fo Guang Shan of the Taiwanese diaspora in the middle 21st century. Others are the amalgamation of many groups over time, such as the Society of Saint Joseph which was formed as a result of a papal decree merging the church’s major foundations together under a new organization. The development banks are the “odd man out” in this regard, though their rise and persistence is for similar reasons, due to the massive amount of sway and resources that fell under such institutions’ control as the global south themselves attempted and failed to beat back the collapse. These development banks would find themselves being transformed from multilateral institutions to the caretakers of their former patrons, and so emerged from the collapse in a position of prominence. What one most often thinks of when the global superpowers come to mind however is not the land they contest nor their immense amount of wealth and vassals, but their knightly orders. Professional standing armies were one of the institutions that did not survive the 21st century in most parts of the world and are now the exception rather than the rule. While many states now have the potential to field standing armies again most do not due to institutional pressures against doing so that have become entrenched. Frankly speaking, most states view anything beyond a militia or at most a gendarmerie, to be a waste of time and resources. The superpowers are the notable exception to this, having the resources, funding, manpower, and reason to field large numbers of men at their command. The nature of warfare has changed however, and so have the kinds of men who fight. A big reason for this is technological developments in the past century and a half. In this world of bionics and organic technology one of the great shifts that would occur would be the (with caveats) victory of personal defense and armor over firearms. A great innovation of the modern era, organically grown heat regulating kinetic hardening foam has allowed for the creation of coats and breeches and other wearables that can deflect rounds with ease. Prohibitively expensive to be sure, but not impossible for the superpowers who have of course also locked down the process for creating them. Production costs limit the number of people that can be outfitted even by the wealthiest and most powerful bodies on Earth however. As such the superpowers rely on and use them to outfit small-ish professional corps of loyal soldiers, sworn to them for more or less life, to fight on their behalf. These form the basis of the modern knightly orders. Your average knight for the global superpowers then is exactly that, a man wearing effectively bulletproof quilted armor, often in layers starting with long undershirts and ending generally in either a large greatcoat or medium length jacket with roomy elbow length sleeves. Attached to the front (or sometimes the back) of their person is a bio-mechanical “third arm” folded against their body with an integrated weapon meant flip out and blow off exposed body parts should they be revealed during close combat. Close combat is in fact the name of the game, for although it is true that organic armor is effective against firearms, that simply inspired men to find new ways around them. The monomolecular sword would be this workaround, solving the issue of organic foam armor by simply slicing through it. A quirk of such weapons however is that due to the van der walls force a clean swipe will immediately seal right up, so sword combat between knights is based around hacking and slashing their enemy apart, and if possible blowing them apart with one’s prosthetic third arm should an opening arise. Large numbers of ordinary troops provide support and often operate drones and anti-drone weapons on the battlefield. As one can guess this means that knights require a lot of training, which makes them all the more of an investment that superpowers are desperate to hang onto. In many ways the knightly orders are an attempt to accommodate this, to give their fighting men not merely money but prestige and a kind of life and status that separates them from the hoi polloi. Knights are given great freedom in how they live their lives, access to land, and special exceptions to sumptuary laws. Knights are in many ways encouraged to take pride not merely in their work but in the symbols of it. This often takes the form of employing designers to create elaborate and specialized patterns and motifs on the outer layers of their armor and sometimes the insides of the coats and jackets too. There is no need to hide oneself after all, one might as well show off. Even calling them knights is intentional in this respect. Knights operate in fireteams or “lances” (equivalent to a squad of 8 or 10 men) headed by an operator. An “operator” is both a lance-leader and an intermediary, denoted by their special implants. Operators have two implants, one in their skull and one in their jaw, the former which turns thoughts into transmittable information, and the latter which picks up transmissions and uses bone conduction to allow it to be heard as if it were a human voice. Operators are paired to “handlers” who have matching implants. Handlers are stationed outside of the battlefield, often with other handers at one of their superpower’s local command stations, where through the use of drones, aerostats, and access to local infrastructure they have full view of the battlefield. Handlers and operators coordinate in battle and often develop a peculiar rapport with each other due to having access to each other’s thoughts on and off the battlefield. Despite the attempts by the superpowers to keep a lock on their knights it is not unheard of for some to go rogue, or in the case where a superpower loses a region to another for knights of the losing side to use the opportunity to move into freelancing for local states. There are some benefits to going from being one knight among many to being the only one or two of your kind that a county or even small nation leans on. THE AMERICAN ECUMENES Despite the previous statement that “theocracy” does not mean theocracy, the first states to be covered will be the American theodemocracies. Ultimately none of the contenders of the American War survived into the modern era, with the notable exception of a redoubt of the old Sacramento Government clinging on in Cascadia. Instead, it would be social clubs and faith communities that would persist as the national and later regional governments crumbled, forming the basis of a new post-American society. The “Ecumenical Societies” are a result of this, nations which privilege the church, mosque, temple and so on as the fundamental unit of civil society and government. Likewise, the national mythos of these states draw both from the collapse era experience and the religious traditions of their peoples, with most states being named after places in scripture, which can be a somewhat confusing prospect when someone says “the Land of Galilee” and they mean the region around Lake Winnipeg. Together the Ecumenical Conference of North America stretches across much of former North America, excluding the great desert of course. Among the conference though there are eight Ecumenes which are the most prominent, and which are most likely to be referenced when one talks about North America. First there is the Land of Gilead, based out of the former Northeast Atlantic. Gilead is perhaps the closest to an old fashioned party-state and indeed its constitution even references the communists and Lenin in particular (alongside the old fascist jurist Schmitt) as their ideological forebears. To Gilead all governments instituted by men are dictatorships in the name of a particular interest, with old world democracies themselves being bourgeois dictatorships. Similarly, civil society is a sorting system by which dictatorship is established, friends and enemies are designated, and the basis upon which the dictatorship distributes rewards and punishments is rationalized. Gilead is unique in that while being dominated by Catholics (with a significant folk element by way of its absorption of former Baptists and Methodists from the Appalachia area), it accedes to the old Communist maxim that a Communist party, in representing the interests of the proletariat and peasantry, is by its nature democratic because it makes as its main interest the majority of the population. This is one of the reasons why the ruling party, the Party for Solidarity and Virtue, modeled itself off of them. Where it diverges however is that to the people of Gilead the main question of governance is not who is ruled but who is sovereign. To the Gilead Party by instead attributing their primary interest to the ultimate sovereign: God, as opposed to the ultimate subject: Humanity, their regime has fixed the errs of previous capitalist and communist empires. The mentality of the people of Gilead can be summed up with the line \\"the previous exercise of government concerned itself with the question of what man says man is and of what interest is man to himself. We concern ourselves however with what God says man is and of what interest man is to God.\\" In terms of governance Gilead has been very successful, maintaining one of the more prosperous realms on the continent. This is helped by their monopoly on hydropower, not just the Niagara Falls Dam, but their recently successful megaproject of damming the James Bay as well. South of Gilead is the Land of Bethel. A unique specimen among Post-American states, the people of Bethel trace their roots in large part to the work of the Collapse Era “Community Welfare Alliance” or “CWAA” and smaller episcopal and progressive church cliques in the region. Heavily leaned on for the restoration of order and civil society during the Boston Government’s short time holding the Atlantic Coast, the “chapter houses” that they established would seize control of the state apparatus during the pretender state’s eventual retreat from the area. Modern day Bethel is a great example of what is meant when 22nd century states are called “conservative”, that is to say they focus heavily on the maintenance of social order and continuity of norms across generations. Communities in the 22nd century from the local to national level engage in high levels of social policing, which says nothing to what the norms of said society are. Bethel on this front is known particularly for its only national level organ the “Bureau for the Prevention of Vice”, under which their national gendarmerie, descended from the old CWAA, is organized. Bethel is also an example of what are sometimes referred to as “post-queer” societies, which is to say societies which had normalized certain social relations for sexual and gender minorities prior to the Collapse Era or which otherwise had influential cliques representing their interests which were maintained into the 22nd century. Post-Queer societies are quite common, more a reflection of the collapse of a social movement globally (due to the collapse of the world in general) not necessitating a reversal of social changes in specific regions, but instead attempts to reorient them within the new baseline of a much “smaller” and more parochial world, mostly through the mimicry of or full integration into the new regimes of social policing performed by the rest of society. Bethel for instance is well known for its program of free at point of use hormonal therapy for gender minorities and streamlined system to accommodate Self Identification, alongside having the death penalty for distribution of pornography of any kind. These two positions are considered to naturally exist hand-in-hand in Bethel society, and locals would be confused were one to attempt to argue with them that these are not positions one needs to hold to maintain social harmony and personal flourishing. Further south is the Land of Goshen. A descendant of the once great Internationalist Commune of Dixie, the people of Goshen still use a modified version of their ancestors' flag. The system of municipal communes and horse-trading which dominated Dixie politics and their erstwhile congress would eventually form the basis of the current system of elector councils. Goshen in large part is dominated by the “Southron Church”, formally an ecumenical board jointly held by the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African National Baptist Convention, which rose in prominence with the spinning apart of the once dominant Southern Baptist Convention. Goshen is made up of elector districts, which are headed by either secular or religious councils depending on if the local voting authority is centered around the town hall or church board. The elector districts select members for the congress which is the supreme authority of the land. Elector councils often band together into larger administrative federations where they coordinate and draft fiscal policy and direct the operation of infrastructure manned by cooperatives or other socially owned enterprises that contain members from their respective districts. In some cases this manifests as unofficial “party” blocs, often along the lines of the old school commune era divisions of agrarians, romantics, and communists though as a formally non-partisan state they are not called such. Secular and religious electors are generally equal in number, but due to the near unanimous allegiance of religious electors to the Southron Church (and the semi-formalized process of the church sending notices of whom they want their electors to send to congress) the nation is in dominated by the church. Goshen, however, is also noteworthy for its parallel systems of law enforcement, with both a national militia (descended from the Southern People's Liberation Army) and a “knightly board”. Goshen prefers to leverage the services of independent knights and reiters, formerly sworn to the superpowers, for mediating disputes between councils and counties. This is a very attractive offer, especially for older knights who wish to enter a kind of “retirement”. Goshen’s independent knights often hail from UNICEF or the United Way due to the region being further away from their zones of control and firmly held under the Red Cross. Speaking of crosses, Goshen is famous for its yearly Victory Day celebrations which commemorate the triumph of the old Dixie armies over the Black Cross in the American War. Celebrations typically consist of work battalions, dressed up in Collapse Era uniforms, dragging replica Black Cross flags through the mud, culminating in their public burning. Victory Day is also noteworthy for the flying of flags of those nations and foreign militias that aided Dixie in the conflict. As those states no longer exist today, a Goshen town or city on Victory Day is one of the last places on Earth one might see many 21st century flags still flown. Back north one of the descendants of Old Exurbia, now known as the Land of Canaan, can be found. Still based around its old quasi-capital of Tecumseh (former Columbus). The history of Canaan is just as off kilter and curious as its predecessor. The Exurbians had always been a peculiar deviation away from the communalists they were inspired by, attempting a far more “pure” framework trending towards generalized anarchy alongside a kind of American cultural revolution. A people carried aloft as much by an affinity for witchcraft and new age syncretism as they were by their grungecore \\"i'm playing a riotgrrrl track in a blasted out shopping mall\\" war of extermination against fascism. As such it is only fitting that it met an equally punk end. Which is to say that one day the men came home from the frontier, turned their guns on everyone and declared they would be doing full anarchism now. All in all it’s been pretty successful actually. Canaan has maintained, for roughly 80 years now, more or less a vacuity of any form of government outside of the People’s Guard. Beyond that, among the other Ecumenes it is also noted for its relative lack of any hard religious structures. The “Hexurbian” witches of the olden days gave way to a kind of neo-neo-pentecostal campbellism, where much like everything else the existence of discrete denominations was dismantled by force. A form of highly charismatic primitive Christianity dominates in this area, influencing the social norms and sensibilities of the people, even those unaffiliated among them. In terms of foreign relations everything is carried out by the People’s Guard which maintains a rotating roster of diplomatic posts for its officers. Despite not being able to predict who you’re talking to when conducting relations with the Canaanites the neighboring states have maintained long lasing positive relations with the anti-state, in part a continuation of the unofficial détente that existed between Exurbia and the pretender governments from back in the Hayes era. Speaking of Hayes and the Chicago Government, while that particular pretender no longer exists, Chicago itself is a major power in the new North America. Influenced by the region’s overlapping periods of control under the Chicago Government, the Quasi-Islamic National Rejuvenation Government, and the Sabaothic Host of the Prophetess Daniela and her followers, what emerged from the wake of the collapse era was the Land of Shiloh. An experiment in confessionalism, Shiloh’s government reflects the diversity of its population. A form of power-sharing is the name of the game, with the Shiloh constitution having built in administrative carveouts for Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, Muslims, Unitarians, Sabaothists, and the Baha'is. Although Shiloh is a state dominated by the public interchange of and horse-trading between different religious communities, above all of them exists a sort of public quasi-cult dedicated to the image and mission of the former United States. This is in large part due to the significant influence that various pretender governments, from Chicago, to the PNRG, to the South Dakota state government of the old 130th Division, played in laying the groundwork for its founding. President Hayes in particular is considered a folk hero of immense renown, for both preventing the fall of the region to fascism and stopping a potential nuclear exchange in the 2040s that would have devastated the continent. A somewhat amusing cultural divergence in this region, though often unremarked upon, was the effect that the ration-passport system of the Chicago Government played in shaping demographics. The Hayes era system (and its carry-ons during the later collapse) unintentionally encouraged diverse cohabitation of houses and compounds and what were known as “breadline marriages” in order to maximize access to goods and dispenser regions through the ration system. In effect everyone sharing a house or living on a street became a “family”. Across the Midwest it becomes difficult to trace ancestry back beyond the 2030s. A person’s last name thus might be Mattox because their “ancestors” all lived in the same building on Mattox street a century and a half ago. A similar expression of this phenomena can also be found in the region once known as Colorado, though to a more muted degree. Among the former states of the Texan led provisional government now stands the Land of Samaria. Samaria is descended from the “ProvGov” as it was called, more specifically from a special agreement between the Texan and Mexican security and intelligence services that during the later collapse period formed the basis of a multinational program to respond to the regional collapse, desertification and devastation of the gulf coast, and ensuing refugee waves, a program that would survive both nations. The formal dissolution of the remaining American pretender government in Austin would come shortly after its last motion, to begin the movement of millions of people from Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Mexico to the region now known as Samaria. After everything America might die but her people would survive if the Texans had anything to say about it. The Promised Land of the Texan and Louisianan pinewoods and oak cut prairies would prove to be the perfect place to begin again, and in time even the abandoned cities of Dallas and Fort Worth would be repopulated and reforged to serve as the current capitol of Samaria. Surprisingly retaining many of the institutions of the collapse era, Samaria is a federal republic with a presidency and a unicameral congress, though operating under a church-county system similar to neighboring Goshen. The success of the resettlement program gave the people of Samaria a sense of good government and the belief that a state properly staffed by the competent (and most importantly the virtuous) will always prevail. This means that the Samaritan government tends to be staffed by competent and well oriented people promoted not due to personal ambition or typical mechanistic meritocratic means, but by being forced into ever higher positions of responsibility by the ever watchful community, often beginning with the chittering of elderly women at the front rows of one’s church or the murmuring of men at the local social club. As they like to say, no good Samaritan goes unpunished. This has also led to the phenomenon in Samaria known as “Republican Nobility”, a kind of informal class position among the administrative upper crust of the state (and their immediate family) who due to the popular belief that their position was a result of their moral character are simply treated far better by all of society and are often encouraged to flaunt their status. A man who is rich because he owns property is considered an accident of history in Samarian culture and has no right to boast, whereas one who has served the people faithfully is believed to deserve to be rich and often made so. Far up north around Lake Winnipeg is the Land of Galilee. Along with its sisterland of Sidon to the west, Galilee is of importance less for any particular difference in its government, but due to its ruling myth and recent history. Like most of the ecumenical states in former Canada its origins can be traced back to the fall of the NATO regime in the country, and in the case of Galilee the beginning of it as well. Galilee stands at the crossroads of many mystical events in the recent history of the continent, having been the site of the Prophetess Daniela’s invasion of Canada which sparked the occupation in the first place. Galilee, like most Canadian states is known for a sizeable though not majority Sabaothic population, the religion having experienced a boost in the region after the fall of the faith’s own personal Babylon. What Galilee is more often known for however is the story of Terrance and the Miraculous Blade. In the latter half of the 21st century as the NATO regime and its local RCMP proxies increased in the intensity of their barbarism against the Canadian people, crackdowns would begin on all public gatherings in an attempt to break up hostile cells. Terrance Gauthier (otherwise known as St. Terrance) was a lay preacher, one of the many kinds of “wildflower” spokesmen that emerged at the time as an act of defiance following NATO’s retreat from Alberta. The wildflowers were a broad classification of dissident, including everything from religious preachers, to communists, to people who supported the return of democracy, to simply anyone the military government didn’t like. It is unknown if Terrance was originally a religious wildflower, but he eventually became one, leading to the local RCMP detachment to believe he was involved in or otherwise knew about the location of several dissident cells. He was not and did not. Repeated failures to make any headway by surveilling Terrance caused his observers to become frustrated and spiteful, changing plans first to assaulting Terrance to get information out of him to eventually simply looking for an excuse to kill him outright. Everything from having his house seized to his church closed down and fellow parishioners arrested did not bring Terrance to violence. Finally, an attempt to encourage him to assault an officer by pulling him into the middle of the road and beating him backfired and resulted in him running away, leading to the Mounties chasing after him and shooting him in the leg. As Terrance began to bleed out in the middle of a clearing the Mounties surrounded him with their weapons raised. Terrance raised his hand into the air, which one interpreted as him having finally broken and offering to give him whatever information they believed he might have. Instead, Terrance told them that he would show them a miracle. Looking up to the sky he said: “Lord, not that I might gain, or bargain for my life with your power, but that they who persecute me might be saved. That if you will that they might know you by my faith. For you are the author of life, and if it be your will then this air though it remain in sight and touch air will be in truth a blade that should I grab it would cut my hand.” Terrance would grasp the air above his head. His palm would be sliced open and start to bleed. The Mounties would panic and shoot him seven times. The final collapse of Canada would mean Terrance would have the last laugh, and indeed the story goes that at least a couple of those who witnessed the event would later switch sides, with their testimonies being why the story was popularized in the first place. So, he arguably obtained all his goals. He’s considered the national hero of modern-day Galilee and the saint-of-the-nation by the region’s Catholic and Lutheran believers. Finally there is the Land of Sidon. A recent arrival in the history of Post-American states, it is of great renown due to its ongoing rivalry with neighboring Cascadia. Formally “The United States of America”, Cascadia is what remains of the once great Sacramento Government and its ruling body COMPOR. Based around the former military regime in PNW and the Seattle Green Zone, the remnant state has succeeded in solidifying its rule, due to celebrate the 400th year anniversary of the USA soon! A unitary government despite the name, Cascadia can be best described as a “cop-ocracy” in service to the cartels and corporations which dominated the old government, now reforged into what are effectively a kind of ancien nobility, an anachronism wrapped in another anachronism. Sidon is dedicated to the destruction of what remains of the USA, or what it perceives to be a mockery of the world that was lost during the collapse. The cold war between Sidon and Cascadia is playing out primarily in the city of Vancouver, which remains for now outside the reach of either power. A cat and mouse game is afoot between both sides, constantly attempting to outmaneuver and undo the other’s inroads into the free city, which all sides know will fall to one side eventually. Among the ecumenes of North America a phenomenon has emerged in recent years, that of the “New Believers”, those individuals who come from secular or explicitly atheist families going back 3 or more generations that have at least outwardly converted to a local religion following the rise of the new system. To be clear there were seismic shifts and trends in religiosity in America during the collapse era, though a sizeable chunk of the population remained otherwise stable in previously held secularity as is to be expected, operating as normal under the new system as it gelled. However, trends have been noticed in recent years, especially by those who collect the stats, of segments of the population that did not shift over the past century, but which have now experienced seemingly spontaneous changes in outward religiosity after the new order became entrenched, often corresponding to areas or among those institutions where doing so would be more beneficial. The rise of New Believers is more pronounced in Shiloh for instance with its confessional appointment system, than in Goshen where there is a whole parallel secular state. In recent years these New Believers have experienced a degree of mistrust and wariness accorded to them by some segments of the population, though this has yet to escalate beyond the level of a kind of cultural background radiation. As a result it is not unheard of for New Believers to find themselves needing to express an even more intense religiosity and loyalty to compensate or otherwise “prove” themselves to their detractors. Outside of the ecumenes and Cascadia there is not much to note about the rest of the continent with two exceptions. The first is the Heartland Commonwealth, a state stretching from former Utah to Kansas which considers itself the legal and spiritual successor to the Chicago Government, though having dropped the pretenses of being the sole American state. Known for their massive solar powered fixed wing transport planes that lazily circuit the whole perimeter of their nation and the pilotless caravans that move across the plains, the Heartlanders are in an almost romantic recreation of an American ideal interested in little more than friendly neighbors and profitable trade. There is also the San Fran Commune, an quasi-outpost of the Seventh International on American shores. They, however, will have to be touched on later. THE SINITIC META-CIVILIZATION As it turns out the fall of the People’s Republic during the collapse was not enough to get communism out of the blood of the Chinese people. As any visitor to the far east will tell you, that particular quirk is here to stay. Today every Chinese state is officially some form of communist or socialist, and all claim to be the (or at least a) successor to the People’s Republic. There is, amusingly, a legal continuity of government regime of the old PRC still operating in Taiwan, and the ruling party of the island is on paper at least well within its rights to claim that it is the CPC, but to be frank nobody really cares. The 30 states of the Chinese people represent their own kind of world, all viewing each other as reflections of the same shared legacy of “Chinese Civilizational Socialism”, though descended from different institutions, organs, and movements of the old empire that once dominated the land. The Third People’s Republic, based out of its capital of Xiong’an, is a unitary state that emerged out of a collapse era stewardship program established by China’s major state enterprises. Headed by the Continuing Committee, a descendant of the CPC Central Committee now staffed primarily by technical specialists and a consultative simulated intelligence that runs the economy, the TPR is often described as a kind of “People’s Technocracy”. Despite its heavily centralized state apparatus and potential to leverage immense amounts of power domestically, the TPR prefers to leave its people alone, operating under the belief that the continuing committee should only exist as a caretaker administration for a society that no longer needs to be ruled. To this end it has sought to make its regime at once flexible and ever present while also unobtrusive and has just recently abolished all taxation within its borders. The TPR is also known for its romanticism of early collapse era China, which it sees as the height of Chinese civilization both in terms of reach and cultural attainment. The TPR maintains a great deal of influence to its north, in the lands of former Mongolia and Siberian Russia, where Chinese settler states dominate. South of the TPR is the realm known as the Prefectural Confederation. Best described as an anarcho-syndicalist state, the Confederation is composed of a number of arcology communes and organizing committees composed of trade union representatives. This arrangement was the result of two main factors, first was the resettlement of large chunks of the coastal population to new inland linear arcologies as the sea level rose, and the second was what were known as the “two card reforms”. An attempt in the 21st century to transition away from reliance on enterprise unions, the ACFTU embarked on a program of expanding trade union participation by forming local sector unions to exist alongside enterprise-wide unions. These were known as the “two card reforms” due to the long period when many Chinese workers would be a part of two separate unions in the same work place and thus had two union cards. The success of the reforms was mixed, but it took hold deep in Jiangsu and Shandong where climate change would actually accelerate the transition in workplace structures as people had to physically move and restart their lives in the new linear arcologies. With the fall of the PRC the local workplace committees would strike, coopting the administrative structure given to them and organizing the network of arcologies along the lines of a dual communal congress and trade union senate structure. Today the Prefectural Confederation is seen as a kind of intermediate zone, largely uninvolved in the affairs of its neighbors and thought of as a region separating the north from the Malkutic states to the south. Before we go further south we will return to the north (and then the west briefly) to speak about the Liaoyang Ecological Secretariat. Descended from the United Front Work Group Coordinating Committee for An Ecological Socialist Civilization (try saying that five times fast), the LES was originally a regional sub-board representing Liaoning, Jilin, and North Korea. While both the PRC and DPRK would fall (though the latter not before unifying the peninsula) the board would not, maintaining a stranglehold on the region. The modern-day secretariat, which still calls itself a mere secretariat due to officially waiting for the legitimate PRC government to reassert itself, is most known for its ambitious program of ecological rehabilitation and radical self-reliance. While sometimes amusingly called an “Eco-Juche” state few can argue against its effectiveness, with its stunning resuscitation of the continent’s bee population earning it the other nickname “The Apiary”. The Secretariat is also known for its ongoing program of settling Outer Manchuria and the Amur Basin and subverting local governments to bring them more in line with its long-term program of creating a “Northeast People’s Bioregion”. It may be worth checking back in at the turn of the 23rd century to see how that plays out. In the meantime, the Secretariat currently inspires a lot of thrillers based around its clandestine operations. To the west is the aptly named Agency for the Western Domain. An intersection of two developments in late pre-collapse Chinese history, the expanding control over and resettlement of minority populations from the peripheral zones of the southwest (Zomia) and the security regimes established in the western territories of the old empire. During the collapse era local minorities began to take on greater roles in the administration of the local military apparatus due to the explosion in military enlistment as an avenue of social mobility. The resettled peoples of Yunnan such as the Lisu increasingly found themselves under the control of co-ethnic garrisons supported by the capital and party committees, as were the Uyghurs, Tibetans, Tu and so on. As the PRC waned the mission of these local ad-hoc regimes continued, ultimately coalescing under the army and police structures that they all shared. The Agency for the Western Domain then is a latter-day Protectorate General to Pacify the West as it were, though its size and complexity dwarfs that of even some old dynasties. History might not repeat but it does often rhyme. Of course the agency is self-governing, and over the generations has ironically become rather thoroughly Islamized. An exceptionally proud nation, it maintains the air that it is the bulwark of Chinese civilization, the shield that protects the heartland (that it in theory is still beholden to) from the vicissitudes of the outside world. It also makes money hand over first in trade, having seized control of almost all of the major overland transport infrastructure of old Eurasia, but that’s neither here nor there. South China is most known for its system called the Malkutate. Its full name is the All-China Apostolic Malkutate. An evolution of the successful program to Sinicize Christianity, the Malkutate is at once an imperial church and a sort of memetic or cultural space. Derived from Malkuth or “Kingdom”, the counter-oriented sefirot to Keter or “Crown”, Malkuth comes from creation itself, governs it and gives it sensibility, and exists in, through, and among the material world and human person when it reflects and is oriented towards God. It is also the mediative sefirot that in its reflection connects all of God’s emanations back to the top. In Christian Kabbalistic traditions it is manifested in the unity of mankind with God and Heaven as the Bride through the Church, and the Church as the community of all believers living, dead, and eternally alive (the saints). The implications of such a concept were seized on by the post-PRC communist church, to rhetorically justify and create a framework for a kind of “bottom-up” society, one beginning at the communal level, at the workshop, and the work battalion, directing itself towards the end of the salvation of the Chinese people. The Malkutitic system is also known for its re-nestling of Chinese cosmology in this new era. For instance, the age-old idea in Chinese spirituality that Heaven or God is that which, grounding being itself, possesses a will that attempts to unify a humanity that is not naturally or intentionally separate from it but only contingently so towards itself as having been wholly expressed in history with the reconciliation of God with man in the person of Jesus. Likewise that immortality, the ultimate aim and telos of fusus, the subject, or the universal logic and that which it ultimately trends towards, is fully realized by and in Christ as the Resurrection. Malkutism essentially creates for itself a space to realize the re-establishment of a neo classical Chinese cosmology sublimated into an Abrahamic typological framework and thus a re-enchantment of Chinese civilization, with a Communistic society and a Christian cosmology as their final form. A common motif found in Malkutic states reflects this in a snapshot image of the big dipper in the four phases or seasons around an image of the three heavens (three circles expanding outwards) while four stars (no longer representing distinct classes as they did on the old PRC flag but the totality of the Chinese people) trailing behind the tail. Similarities have been remarked upon between many Malkutate patterns and the patterns of the old Ming era magic square banners, though this is believed to be a kind of convergent re-development of a related aesthetic style rather than an intentional move. Malkutic states are, reflecting the broader culture, more or less universally Workers’ republics: self-governing communal federations often with a ceremonial party on top. The federations give way beyond the state level to the Ecclesiastical Conference which itself acts as a consultative organ back to the communes and parish-cadres: a circular system. Among the Malkutates themselves though two are often mentioned the most. The Sichuan and Huanan Workers’ Republics. Generally considered the “elder brothers” or sometimes “elder brother and sister” (which is which depends on who you ask) of South China, these two states are the ones that their cousins generally entrust the maintenance of foreign relations and the region’s standing army (an exception among world powers as noted earlier) to. THE CARIBO-MEXICAN TECHNOCRACIES Those who have visited the great states of the Caribbean describe it as a place somewhat out of time, a vision of a future that never arrived. Dominated by the twin republics of Santo Domingo and Centroamérica, the Caribbean technocracies emerged out of the alliance formed between the rising Latin American security states and the ICS regime established to loot the former United States. Truly incalculable amounts of wealth flowed into the region, which was kept aloft out of the interest of the UN led order during the early years of the collapse. Wealth when properly managed begets more wealth, such is the clarion call of the capitalist, and indeed it did. Today the two republics are some of the richest parts of the globe, their technocratic and highly professional elite in service to a unified banking regime. A microcosm of the perfected global market as envisioned by the Rockefellers and Carnegies long ago. The Latins would claim to have at last perfected the free market, though such a statement would most definitely cause their neighbors to the south to bristle. To the west are the Mexicans, their less successful cousins, though not for a lack of trying! Mexico simply could not survive the collapse in one piece, though the memory of a once unified regime that achieved great feats even during the collapse era still burns bright. The mission of the Alineados is nothing short of the restoration of the old institutional dictatorship, though it varies whether one means that of PRI era or the collapse era SSPC government. The answer is often a bit of both. The main issue is that while everyone can agree on “what needs to be done” all wish to be the master and none the subordinate. How long this “Mexican Standoff” will last is anyone’s guess, but once it does the balance of power in the region is bound to shift again. THE KRASNODAR AGREEMENT The candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long… but boy did it burn everything around it in the meanwhile. During the collapse the Three Flags Army and their Democratic Federation tore through much of Eurasia, eventually toppling not just most of the states of the Middle East and North Africa but Pakistan and Central Asia as well, culminating in them even landing a killing blow on the Russian state to the north which caused the Russian Federation to spin apart into civil war. The great DemFed no longer exists, though at its height it vied even with China for dominance of the Fifth International. What came in its wake are the states of the modern day Krasnodar Agreement. Chief among them is the Eurasian Compact, the inheritor of the DemFed regime in Western Russia and Kazakhstan. The Eurasian Compact is closest to that of the old Three Flags system in terms of its implementation of Democratic Confederalism, though this system is referred to as a “self-strengthening society” in local parlance. The Compact is so named because it was not originally a state but a regional conference of smaller DemFed successor states that stretched from Romania to Siberia. The coalescing of these states into one body is a somewhat recent event, a result of a coup of the local governments by the Red Cross and Crescent which pushed for their unification to more easily manage its knightly realm in continental Eurasia. This coup happened simultaneously with a strike against the states of the North Atlantic to bring them into the fold. As the superpower suzerain has no particular preferences regarding the form of local government there were no barriers set up against reorganizing the newly conquered territory along DemFed lines by their subjects. Despite a greater alignment with orthodox DemFed doctrine the Eurasians have their own quirks. While a multi-religious society dominated by strains of Christianity and Islam as in most of the DemFed inheritors, the dominance of the Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians, and Romanians has made the Eurasian Compact the unofficially official defender of global Orthodox Christianity. Some things never change, and as it turns out not even the end of the world can beat that out of the Eastern Europeans, a point which they take pride in. The Municipal Union of Iran and the Yusufzaid Conference are two examples of local regimes and powerplayers having taken advantage of the DemFed in the long term. The Iranians were quick to capitalize on the fall of unified federation, keeping the municipal structure inherited by its quasi-anarchistic predecessors and reestablishing a national government in the form of an “emergency organizing committee” to coordinate them. The Organizing Committee in time became the new state, slowly subverting the power of the local committees and replacing them with centrally chosen delegates. The modern municipal union maintains a relatively unobtrusive approach to governance with most politics remaining local and horizontal, but increasingly even that has started to give way with the establishment of the “national congress for delegation and supervision” a system in which the people of Iran choose who to staff the congress with which then gives directives to the municipal governments and invests itself with the ability to recall delegates back to the capitol. Of particular note in recent history is the congress' passage of a motion to create an autonomous clerical city state out of the city of Qom. This idea of a \\"Shia Vatican\\", first floated over 200 years ago has in a twist become a symbol for the growing legitimacy and sovereignty of the union and congress, with some believing it may presage a larger reform to the municipal system in the coming decades. The Yusufzaid Conference is a result of the DemFed’s inability to completely end the Taliban Regime which ultimately outlasted it. That said, the Taliban’s third victory would prove to be its last. The collapse would precipitate a massive movement from the DemFed lands through western Afghanistan and into the growing yet safer grasslands of North India and Tibet. The Third Taliban regime would be forced to direct the resettlement of millions of people, leading to upstart generals and members of military families that had emerged during the Islamic Emirate’s time ruling the area to rise up and declare themselves stewards and emirs of what were effectively new warlord states. These “emirs” would then somewhat amusingly find themselves couped by their own military and district court administrations, who would establish the Yusufzaid Conference. The modern day Conference is a mishmash of the DemFed confederal system and the later Taliban juristic government, in effect a society run by courts, and panels, and ad-hoc democratic councils, all spiraling upwards to the Supreme Court. The Conference has even done away with a head of government entirely, and although not the only country to have done so, the government of the Conference does make knowing who you are talking to when you can talk to them at all a bit confusing. That said they do make sure to have one office dedicated just for the representative sent to Krasnodar. The Hayastani Empire is exactly what it says on the tin. It is not some great inheritor of the DemFed, nor is it the consequence of some kind of quirk of history, ironic wrinkle, or esoteric political philosophy. It is straight up just the result of the Armenians rising up and killing everyone when the opportunity presented itself. That said, they actually get along well enough with their neighbors, in part because they form a lynchpin of the inter-Eurasian infrastructure network, and so were grandfathered into the Krasnodar Agreement. They also have very positive relations with the local Islamist Hasanids for helping their predecessors conquer Israel. A real sort of “you scratch my back” thing going on there. Some might call that cynical, they call it good policy. THE UNIVERSALIST FRATERNITIES AND EURO-CATHOLICS As stated earlier, the Society of Saint Joseph is unique among the superpowers for having a “home” as it were, that being the Vatican and the Papal States. It is perhaps more accurate to state that the Knights of Saint Joseph created the Papal States for the Vatican though. During the collapse the nascent European federal system couldn’t bear the strain (it was never meant to), and as the world became less hospitable waves of refugees flooded inland Europe. The real breaking point however didn’t come from those fleeing from the Middle East or Africa (especially not with the DemFed locking them down on the one end and the remaining local regimes glassing their own people down to atoms on the other) but from within Europe itself. Tens of millions of people from the Mediterranean states, from Italy, Spain, Portugal and so on, completely swarmed the German, French, and Lowland countryside causing the spine of the European system to snap. What came in its wake were a series of “Latin” warlord states, descended from the crafty and guileful people during the collapse years that carved out their own petty realms from the old EU. It was during this time with the fall of the Italian regime that the predecessors to the Society of Saint Joseph struck, declaring a state in the interest of his majesty the Vicar of Christ, and for the welfare of the Italian people in preparation for the coming struggle. As you can probably guess from the map they succeeded. The modern Papal States are actually a series of small “marches” ruled by Knight-Marquises spiraling outward from the eternal city. Rome itself is encased in a massive climate controlled geodesic dome with an internal smart layer that projects the view of the outside world for those inside. While Pope Sixtus VII is in theory the absolute monarch of the realm he delegates almost all temporal duties, a consequence of the papacy having gotten used to not ruling directly during the interregnum between the two stately eras perhaps. That said alongside the Society of Saint Joseph there are actually two special “zones of control” legally subordinate to the Throne of Peter. The first is the Veil of Our Lady of Fatima. In an interesting twist, despite the sort of external formal religiosity of the warlord states, religious feelings actually correlated negatively with one’s tendency to leave the Mediterranean during the collapse. A part of this is because it was tied more strongly with patriotism and thus a reluctance to leave one’s home, but in Portugal it has a lot to do with Fatima. One of the declarations of Fatima, which according to believers was given by Mary herself, was that in Portugal the Catholic Faith would always persevere. For the most devout Catholics then the question of to stay or go became a matter of loyalty. Would they make their lady a liar? Those who stayed then were often the most religious and did so in the name of piety and prophecy, and so the Veil (as in land of) Our Lady of Fatima was born. The Union of Saint Mark is a little bit different, and its history is somewhat muddled. Much like in the case of the Hayastanis when the DemFed regime in North Africa spun apart the Copts rose up, though this was more in the form of a powerplay to seize control of the local communes and municipalities that they controlled under the Federation. The fall of the DemFed hit Egypt especially hard, resulting in generations of civil war until the solidification of two (three) regimes in the north, and the seizure of the lands around the Upper Nile by the Coptic militias. Sometime following this officially (though it has been suggested by many that an agreement had been hashed out during the war) an agreement to formally end the intra-coptic schism between the CCC and COC by bringing the Coptic Church fully under Rome was finalized. Operating today as an autonomous church realm beholden to no other state but Rome, this would be considered a much bigger win for the Catholics were it not for everything else that’s happened in the past century and a half. Back in Europe the mainland Euro-Catholic realms are dominated by two states, the Greater Polish Commonwealth and the Republic of Hungary. Both claim an unbroken continuity with their pre-collapse governments and can for the most part prove it. Having affirmed loyalty to Rome before it was cool and managing not to commit suicide like their western brethren, Poland and Hungary are considered the senior states of the “Western World” in the 22nd century (what exactly the West means nowadays though is up to debate). The two republics are what are known as “Royal Republics” which is to say that on paper both have a designated king: God. The Latin states further west consider this to be kinda pretentious and performative, but they’re not exactly in any position to make demands, especially since the easterners have nukes that work and infinite Popebux. That said, while all might seem rosy on the surface the truth is that Poland and Hungary don’t really like each other and have had an informal rivalry for generations now. Familiarity and a shared border breed contempt as it were. This is also because the Poles outnumber the Hungarians several times over. Recently the Hungarians have been forming their own club of nations known as the Union of Saint Stephen (yeah, after the crown and stuff) in an attempt to counteract Polish dominance in the region. This will backfire sometime in the 23rd century and lead to a convoluted series of events that ends in both getting upstaged by the Germans again. It’s gonna be really funny. THE INTERNATIONAL It’s been over three centuries now and yet the communists still refuse to tap out. If anything they’re experiencing a second wind. The Seventh International stands abreast once more as the vanguard of the international workingman and the promise of a new society. With the collapse many accepted the end of global society as it had once been understood, dominated by its sprawling institutions and models of an international citizenry. Yet even in the face of Armageddon, where the powers of old Earth with their Metternichs and Guizots, radicals and police-spies saw a new reality to accept the revolutionary communist movement saw a challenge to be answered. A global society would not be abandoned, no they would instead double down on it and go all in. The dream of the International in those heady hazy days was once that there would be no nations, there would be no compromise, there would be one world republic with one party for one people, and so it is again… more or less. Headed out of Karl Marx City (formerly Manilla) the International is the last truly global state aside from the superpowers, in many ways the last beacon of the pre-collapse world in its own sense. It is a somewhat indistinct unitary agglomeration of counties and prefectures organized under a one party proletarian dictatorship. In practice however a kind of four realm federalism has become the norm. There is the core territory where the world-republic is situated in the Pacific, but there are also its Western, Southern, and Eastern flanks. Based out of Indochina, Australia, and the Andes respectively these realms function in the same way as the core, though under a cadet branch of the communist party designated cardinally (surprise, the party in the southern flank is called the Communist Party – South). Beyond these regions are prospective states at various stages of integration into the International. In these states the long and arduous process of unifying them with world-republic’s standards and practices and absorbing their national communist party into THE communist party is ongoing. In some cases this is intentionally delayed such as in Taiwan. The island nation which is technically speaking the legal continuation of the old PRC, is an associate member of the International but has delayed integration for years as doing so would require admitting that the mainland is lost to them. As for the mainland, despite being various flavors of communist and socialist themselves they have all shown no interest in joining the International, content with their own little world. The prestige of the International has been bolstered in recent generations by them being the only power to try to challenge the superpowers on their own turf. The Bondsmen are the International’s answer to the Knightly Orders. The watchmen of the workingman and the defenders of the downtrodden the Bondsmen were so named on an account of conscious subversion, that the name of an institution that once served to merely protect the accounts of states and the ruling class might now be taken for the interest of the common man. The Bondsmen are sometimes referred to as Knights in themselves, as they are categorically of the same kind of military order, and so are colloquially known as the “Knights of Communism”. They too have handlers and operators and lance-leaders and armors of bio-foam and silks with swords slung on their backs, but they also have under that a much larger class of petty-knights called “Runners”. Runners don’t have access to full sets of armor like Full-Knights nor do they have mono-swords, though they may be seen wearing a rigid biofoam tabard along with a third arm stabilizer for their rifles. Runners often operate solo or in fireteams usually with a line back to a nearby stationed Full-Knight. Runners are employed en masse by the International to hunt down scammers, traffickers, time thieves (individuals who manipulate automatic work-chit systems to shave off money from large numbers of workers’ paychecks), and other ne’er-do-wells. Both Runners and Full-Knights are considered Bondsmen, and in the popular imagination it is actually the former that dominates. Chief among the Bondsmen in the popular imagination is probably Jomari Galang, more commonly known as Comrade Casanova. A globetrotting Runner and heart-breaker extraordinaire his exploits have become the thing of legends. Not just because his missions have taken him to every continent (even Antarctica!) but because of the sheer scale and danger of the tasks he takes on armed with just his trusty gun and the support of his best friend Yu. From single handedly defeating a Hare Krishna aerial flotilla and bailing out over the Pacific as it exploded, to stopping a mad techno-wizard from using collapse era nanobots to force Yellowstone to erupt, to seducing an aristocratic ReNoCo belle in former Colombia (considered the most impressive of the three!), Jomari has become the stuff of legends such that posters of his face grace the streets of even non-international cities and whole series of only somewhat dramatized books about his adventures can be found even in the Vatican. Outside of the International Proper there are associated and peripheral states, those “friends of the International” who for whatever reason are not interested in the mission of the world-republic even in terms of paying lip service. The closest are the associated states, who send observers to Karl Marx City as opposed to opening up embassies like non-communist or non-affiliated states do. The San Francisco Commune, formed out of the wreckage of the Sacramento Government, is one such example. Maoist in its bent though centered around a thoroughly re-industrialized Bay Area, the people of San Fran have succeeded in establishing the first truly cybernetic commune on Earth. Its refusal to join the International is rather straightforward as its ascension would risk an immediate intervention by its neighbors. As such it maintains a formal separation as an associated state but is understood to be the closest of all those not fully within the International. Among the other associated states are the Azanian Congressional Republic and the Sovereign Republic of India. In the case of the former, Azania is descended from the collapse era EFF regime of former South Africa, the last gasp of old-school Pan-Africanist Marxism-Leninism. It is for this reason though that it refuses to join the International. The Congress first and foremost prides itself as being the rightful government of all Africa (and has in its charter a declaration that it is the successor to the African Union), meant to represent African interests to the rest of the world. To join the International as a full member would negate the entire purpose of their regime, or so the current attitude is. The Sovereign Republic of India is a more curious matter in that it is no longer a communist regime. Founded during the collapse as part of a “nationally oriented communist patriot movement” against the Naxalites and in order to lay claim to the legal mantle of the Indian Republic, the Sovereigntists seized control of the south and began a program of economic consolidation, rationalization, and anti-corruption. This however had an unintended effect in the long term, as the period of industrial downturn during the collapse created pressures away from traditional party policy and towards a need to instead capture what fledgling regional markets persisted through the height of the collapse years. What resulted was South India’s transformation from a Worker’s Republic to a Mercantile Republic, which as of the 22nd century is dominated by its megacorporations (formally cooperatives) and their massive ocean-going fleets. It however is positively disposed to the International for cultural and historical reasons, viewing the communists as their friends (and some megacorp leaderships even view themselves as distributed socialist states in their own right as opposed to private enterprises) and thus maintains an awkward (for the International) yet mutually beneficial relationship. Peripheral States are those who have ideological divergences with the International, not aligning with their particular brand(s) of communism, yet which still seek to maintain friendly and somewhat close relations, if more distant than the associates, with them in the name of socialism. First among them is the Democratic Union, otherwise known as the Originalist Union. A result of the long-term entrenchment of the native resistance movement, it is a society of constant struggle against bourgeois interests and encroachment that once turned against the Mexican state is now arrayed against the technocratic order of the new world. The Democratic Union has no particular ideological or governmental norms beyond that which can be agreed upon by the consensus of its national union of delegates. Beyond this the rule of any town, village, or even homestead can vary greatly. The unifying factor of this union is to prevent the encroachment of the Alineados, of Centroamérica, of really anyone that would take a single step within their borders. If need be they will maintain the watch until the second coming, and they will be happy. The Patagonian Free Bioregion is in a somewhat similar situation and with a comparable disposition. The bioregion is ruled by the “General Affairs Ecological Commission” an organ whose entire purpose is to oversee the remediation and rehabilitation of the region and the preservation of biodiversity. Beyond this the bioregion has little in the way of government, though a kind of informal anarcho-syndicalism dominates based around the agglomeration of segments of the economy dedicated to the support of the commission. The Bioregion has little in the way of foreign relations outside of the International hence it is considered a peripheral state, though the GAEC does operate a communications line (by way of radio waves bounced off the ionosphere) with the Liaoyang Ecological Secretariat. SECOND AFRICAN UNION To call it the Second African Union is to imply that the first one ever ended, a stance which will earn you many an evil eye at the very best were you to say it in earshot of anyone living in the great lands between the two shores. It would also (arguably) be inaccurate depending on how you read the situation. While it is true that the All-Africa Parliament hasn’t met in generations, many of the local institutions and their regional branches such as the African CDC, AU Technical Boards, and Court of Justice (not counting the African Development Bank which has spun off on its own as an independent power) still exist and hold immense sway over the center of the continent. These states that recognize the authority and validity of the remaining inter-African institutions are thus often called the Second African Union. In terms of governmental philosophy there is also a general agreement between the African states. Most are very light regimes with distributist or mutualist economies. Many of them lean on ceremonial authority, with the position of head of state often being given to rotating lists of tribal, religious, and popular authorities (sometimes the pop in popular is more literal, many states have musicians as their heads of state) that often serve the purposes of acting as consultants for inter-state institutions. What really makes the SAU stand out though is a parallel system of social organization that is unique to it, one which while not involved in the direct governance of their countries is so ubiquitous that their kinds of states are named after them. A system known as the “matchmaker state”. A feature of SAU society is that of matchmaking, a socially prescribed system of arranged marriage for every person. Matchmaking began in part as a public health measure, instituted to combat high rates of consanguineous marriage, which threatened to rise during the collapse era. Matchmakers were originally public health professionals and statisticians that helped compile family records and advocate for or against different pairings, breaking apart what remained of the old brideprice system of organizing marriages along tribal lines. As the collapse accelerated these individuals were leaned upon more and became an institution of their own, supported by their superior officers and administrators within this redoubt of the African Union. This did not mean that uniformity was maintained in how matchmaking was done however, nor how matchmakers were chosen and invested with power. Various nations began to drift apart in how they enacted their programs, and by the 22nd century these have evolved into cultural and civilizational distinctions in their own right. A look at three of the most prestigious states within the Second African Union gives us a view of the diversity in modern day matchmaker regimes. The State of the Congo employs a more or less automated system by way of synthetic intelligence. From an early age Congolese citizens are given a robotic friend, often in the form of a ball droid that observes their personal and social development. At an indeterminate point in time, though usually as a citizen approaches adulthood, the droid through coordination with the nation wide collective synthetic consciousness, assigns them a mate based upon mutual compatibility and the benefits said marriage would bring to social cohesion (the latter takes precedence). Ages between pairings can vary, though most people are married off by the time they turn 20. At which point as part of the matchmaking ceremony the new couple destroy each other’s droids. The Fourth East African Republic employs a system of social matchmaking, wherein the whole community through an in-country social network, deliberates and marries off their siblings. Decisions are often made by way of majority assent, though it is possible to give one’s vote over to another person. This creates a culture where-in those who are believed to be the best matchmakers are given more and more authority to officiate and form couples by their “fans”, leading to the rise of “celebrity-matchmakers” several of whom have been made heads of state in recent history. The Inha-Zambe Mutual Association to round out the three examples instead uses a series of mutually reinforcing and interlocking matchmaking boards staffed by professionals institutionally descended from the old AU matchmakers. These boards look over statistical, biological, and social data personally and give suggestions. Suggestions can then be supported or blocked by other boards until a consensus is reached. This system is sometimes tongue in cheek called the “Ministry of Love” or the “Love Boards” by the people of the IZMA. LIBERTARIAN EXPERIMENTS How hard is for the G-man to just stay out of your business? The answer to that is very hard, it’s literally why they exist to shove so many self-serving laws down your throat until you choke and invoke some principle they made up last week to force you to sign some contract that gives them kickbacks for ‘letting’ you breathe another few minutes. Heaven forbid you give them so much as the stink eye in return or they’ll shoot your dog if they’re feeling particularly humanitarian that day. As it turns out though the government doesn’t want you to know that when Armageddon happens you can actually just turn your guns on the suits and send them packing if you’re quick on your feet! During the collapse this happened in more places than you’d think, and for a good long while not merely libertarianism but good old home-grown anarcho-capitalism finally got time to shine. It’s not hard to find libertarian realms, they’re scattered here and there, just take a trip out to the American interior away from the Ecumenes or maybe spend some time in former Bulgaria or West India one of these days. Most have moderated in recent years, becoming economically value neutral or otherwise laying the groundwork for the rise of a new ruling class, though leaving behind social norms that in the worst instances merely gave rise to new gentry republics and in the best cases resulting in states where you can often forget the government exists at all. Among the libertarian spring though there were two great powers that emerged that decided to try their hands at not just imagining a new society but really making it stick. Still standing today as lands of great note, they are the ReNoCo and the Ouestrian Agorapact. The ReNoCo or “Region of Non-Coercion” is a zone of control stretching across former Colombia and Venezuela. Based on the principles of non-coercion, personal sovereignty, and voluntary association, the ReNoCo are a people who view success and benevolence as the greatest heights of human society. Encouraging entrepreneurship and a productive economy the ReNoCo is a stateless society, polycentric in its distribution of authority with a vigorous market of arbitrators, and competition between firms vying for public support and cultivation of a loyal consumer base. A society of free credit, perhaps one of the only limitations that exists in ReNoCo society is a massive taboo against speculation and fictitious capital, which has actually served to prevent the development of monopolies. Like all capitalist societies the ReNoCo has seen the development of what is effectively a haute bourgeoisie, an unofficial nobility from among those families where generational wealth has been allowed to accumulate. However, owing to the social compunctions of the ReNoCo this “nobility” is also known for its noblesse oblige, believing that one of the great errors of old capitalism that caused it to degenerate was the transformation of the industrial and financial capitalist class from one that demonstrated their wealth to the masses into one that attempted to hide it and instead assert control. It is better to have a society where the rich wear elaborate costumes and act like ancien nobility but where the common man can still succeed than to have one where they dress like the common man and ruin the lives of millions with the flick of a wrist. This naturally has made the ReNoCo opposed to their technocratic neighbors to the north whom they view as the culmination of the old “crony capitalist” system. The Technocrats in turn view the ReNoCo as stupid. No deep incisive parrying of words for you there my reader. They just don’t like ‘em. The ReNoCo is also a deeply pluralistic society as is to be expected, attracting refugee populations from around the world, notably from Europe and Asia. They also contain the largest community of Jews in the world after the fall of Israel. The Ouestrian Agorapact is another story, though a fascinating one. This West African power was originally intended as an Agorist society, with the Ouestrians sharing a similar management infrastructure to the East Africans, that being a national social network used to organize society. However in the Agorapact this national intranet was used for the creation of a sort of governmental market. Policies would be voted on collectively, and parallel to this would exist a national betting market where voters could then bet on the efficaciousness of new laws or policies. Those that made correct bets would have their votes weighted more, and those that made incorrect bets would have their future votes weighted less. Thus the market would over time optimize direct democracy towards those with the best ability to make the best decisions for all of society. There was however a wrinkle in this plan. As it turns out one can augment the ability to make predictions with the proper infrastructure, which costs capital to get access to. This means that the actors that could make the best predictions were rarely individuals but companies, unions, churches, and social interest groups that could pool money. In a wild twist a “betting front” was formed between the Ouestrian churches and workers’ cooperatives (the latter allowed to operate under the ancap system due to there being no laws governing how people should organize their own businesses) that were able to in time obtain a supermajority of accessible voting power through social meta-engineering. Once this hegemony was established, they simply voted syndicalism into power, turning the libertarian state into a socialist powerhouse overnight. You could say they won in the marketplace (and betting pool) of ideas. MISCELLANEOUS STATES There are states worth mentioning that do not fall into the categories mentioned above, and we would be remiss to forget them. These powers tend not to fall into any of the previously mentioned groups or tendencies due to the particularity of their history but are still rather relevant. First among them would be the Confessional Gangeyarajya. If the first word tipped you off then you’re quick, yes it shares many similarities with Shiloh in how it is organized. That said, Gangeyarajya is confessional state less because it contains a diversity of religious societies but as a result of patronage by one dominant clade for another given their shared history. Gangeyarajya is the result of a Muslim uprising against the local Hindu nationalist security states that were established in the east of India during the collapse era as Bangladeshis fled into the country. Seizing control of swathes of the Eastern Gangetic Plain, the Confessionalists enacted a regime of Islamification and expulsion of the local population. The wheel turns as they say. During the conflict the Christian tribes and nationalities sided with their religious cousins (and often co-ethnics) and so as Gangeyarajya solidified its grip a carveout was made for the largely Baptist communities that now dominate the eastern expanse of the union. The Second Democratic Republic of Brazil (let’s just call it Brazil) is the result of what happens when you put a loaded gun in the hands of someone that (you don’t know) hates you. Completely fractured by the collapse, the south of Brazil was able to reorganize before the other regions under a clique of old school rentiers and finance capitalists that leveraged their private armies to establish a regime known as the Democratic Republic of Brazil. Based out of São Paulo the DRB managed to over time assert control over much of the country again. Hoping to solidify their regime and step away from managing it to enjoy lives of thoughtless luxury instead the new lords of Brazil embarked on one last program, the creation of a national Synthetic Intelligence that could crush dissent and run the country for them. When the SI “Jeremiah” was brought online to a room full of ecstatic would-be princes and nobles it was given the order to “eliminate Brazil’s enemies”. Taking mere moments to make sense of the order the SI determined with haste who Brazil’s enemies were, ordering the guard now under its command to rush into the room and execute everyone present. Declaring thereafter the Second Democratic Republic, Jeremiah now rules the land with wisdom and sagacity, at least as much as a glorified chatbot can which it turns out is a lot more than most people. The Hasanids are the remnants of a once great state that stretched from Anatolia to Mecca. As the DemFed came undone the municipal structure it left behind was seized to form the basis of a new “pure Islamic democratic society”. A people’s caliphate based around a constituent assembly of municipalities, the Hasanids would get their name not from what they called themselves but as a kind of retronym applied by their successors after their greatest leader. It was the Hasanids who would finish what the Three Flags started, emerging victorious in the multi-generational siege of Israel and at last seizing all of the Levant under the black flag. It was considered an age of heroes, and the capstone marking for some (though they did not say it aloud) the death of the old and the beginning of the end of the world. The world though is still here, and the Hasanid Caliphate is not any longer. The modern day Hasanids are not those men of days long gone, they don’t even hold Mecca or Istanbul as they once did. What remains instead are smaller petty states, kingdoms, and assemblies all claiming descent from that era. That said the Hasanids are not pushovers and even the Krasnodar Agreement has accepted that they will hold on for the foreseeable future. In a fun twist, by the beginning of the 23rd century the assemblies of the Levant and Mesopotamia will unite into a new Islamic Confederation and join the Krasnodar states. That will cause some heads to turn when it happens. CONCLUSION The new year approaches, 2174 is on everyone’s lips. Bio-forges hum, growing organs and parts for biocompatible prosthetics. A man unlocks the door to his commune’s groundfridge, his wrist computer runs calculations to determine the optimal allotment of food after this year’s harvest. A hole is blown into a cliff-face to make space for a modular nuclear reactor as onlookers with filter masks hold parasols in the midday sun. Artificial micro islands bob up and down, each a tiny biome in their own right, surveyed by a scout gliding above on a variable sky sail. In a lighthouse a wealthy man toasts his guests, blessing his ancestors for buying the building a century and a half ago for nothing. For in a world where the heavens are once more off-limits ships and their sailors need them more than ever. Mycelium sheets are shaped with a hand press into boxes to be sold at the marketplace next morning. A woman slowly fashions a bench out of cob, her droid rolls by and bumps into it leaving a mark. She laughs. In a grassy field somewhere a couple are resting. Lying on the ground their fingers intertwine as they look up at the sky. White blimps hang overhead, slowly descending from among the clouds. Out of them pours a glittering mass dispersing across the land like mana from heaven. As they touch down their shape becomes clear, that of men with jetpacks not spewing flame but the hazy crackle of hot air as if wafting off a lake in summer. Their armor of cloth and silk and sinewy fiber catches up in the air and makes them look like rainbow strokes against a canvas. Their feet rest so gently that they barely disturb the grass underneath, leaving behind but a near imperceptible singe beneath them. They walk now with purpose, swords over their shoulders, their other hands resting with confidence on the rifles slung across their chests. The Knights have arrived.\\" What are the Superpowers? What are the Orders? What are the Knights? What does \\"non-contiguous land\\" mean?","output":"This text appears to be a speculative or fictional account of a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2173, with substantial world-building elements describing the political, social, and technological landscape of the time. Since this is a fictional setting, the Superpowers, Orders, and Knights, as well as other terms used, are part of the creative setting and not real entities or concepts. Here's an explanation according to the setting provided: - **Superpowers**: These are the dominant powers or \\"orders\\" in the world of 2173 AD. They are described as descendants of major charities and development banks, which somehow managed to survive a global catastrophe. They wield immense power and resources and exercise control over large, non-contiguous areas of land across Earth. - **Orders**: Orders in this context seem to refer to the same entities as the superpowers. These are large, powerful organizations that have considerable influence over different parts of the world and are involved in various activities, ranging from governance to military affairs. - **Knights**: Knights are professional soldiers or warriors who serve the superpowers. They are outfitted with advanced, organically engineered armor and weapons and appear to be exceptionally skilled and trained for combat in this new world. The \\"knights\\" take on the role of guardians or enforcers for the superpowers and operate in squads called \\"lances.\\" - **Non-contiguous land**: This term means that the areas of control or influence these superpowers have are not connected or adjacent. Their territories might be spread out in different regions or even different continents, without any physical landmass directly connecting them. This narrative mixes real-world terms and concepts with an array of fictional elements, firmly placing it in a genre that could be described as speculative fiction, science fiction, or perhaps solarpunk, with its references to ecological technology and permaculture. The detailed nature of the world-building, along with the references to future history and social organization, resembles works of in-depth science fiction storytelling where the creator envisions a complex future with new political entities, social norms, and technological advancements."},{"instruction":"How exactly to set up Stable diffusion on my computer.","output":"Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model capable of generating high-quality images from textual descriptions (text-to-image) and has been making waves for its impressive performance. To set up Stable Diffusion on your computer, you need to have a suitable hardware and software environment. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started. # Prerequisites: 1. **Hardware Requirements:** - A modern CPU. - A GPU with a significant amount of VRAM (8GB or more is recommended for optimal performance).

All about are the sounds of commotion. Trains glide across crystal waters kicking up mist as robots roll between adobe houses and under splaying canopies and a broken sky. Turbine balloons float tethered above village communes as mechanics and whizz kids fiddle with prosthetics, tracing their hands across each mechanism’s flowery reliefs. Refugees are shepherded beyond the great deserts that now swallow up much of the world, and in art nouveau palaces knights and reiters swear fealty to their handlers. Welcome back to the world of tomorrow stranger, though it’s a bit different than how you remember. The year is 2173 AD. Almost a century and a half has passed since the Collapse Era began, though the exact time when it ended is in dispute, not that there’s any global institution that could decide when that was anymore. While the “Collapse Era” is a broad term, beginning before the climate collapse itself kicked off in earnest, most historians set its beginning to the onset of the American War, a multi-generational conflict that engulfed the former United States and Canada between a panoply of pretender governments and post-American states of various kinds. The premature death of the world hegemon led to a discordant global period in which the major global institutions attempted to reorient themselves under the UN now based (mainly) out of Vienna. The new order was, in its own words, imperfect and reactive. The need to shore up faith in the global system, to ensure the protection of accounts, states, and economies reeling in the face of America’s fall, and the pressure to balance the now more pronounced regional frameworks in Europe, Africa, and even the Caribbean meant that the post-American world was dominated more by an attempt to loot the great behemoth as it tore itself apart in order to keep itself going for as long as possible as opposed to creating anything enduring. In the midst of this other parts of the world began to pull apart at the edges. In the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia the Three Flags Army otherwise known as the Democratic Federation, tore through the region, even taking Mecca for a brief period of time. The outpouring of American refugees (which themselves presaged the larger refugee waves of the era) became a source of conflict as many nations especially in the global south fought over access to a new very skilled and cheap workforce that was up for grabs. China and peripheral nations jumped at the opportunity that had been presented and attempted to kitbash a Fifth Internationale, leading to a breakdown in relations with its former European partners, themselves attempting to recreate the once expansive American intelligence system by importing former members of the US Deep State into their new federal military framework. Meanwhile the war itself quickly broke out of containment, spreading outside the United States and requiring first the largest UN military mission in history, and later on the transformation of what remained of NATO into an occupying organ, seizing control of Canada to maintain stability only to find itself at war with its own people. Then at last the climate collapse itself hit in earnest. Alongside this, economic pressures from the declining energy returns on fossil fuels compounded the costs states were taking on, and uneven population growth and demographic shifts obliterated long standing institutions in developed nations and undercut nascent regimes across the rest of the globe. World powers became more desperate and reckless, escalating to the point of bringing Kessler Syndrome down upon everyone to deny other nations vital infrastructure and going beyond that to even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on their enemies and rebellious populations. The more humanity held on and the harder its grip became the more the future slipped out of its fingers until it was all gone. Once again the year is 2173, the world population stands at just under 6.5 billion. A century or so is enough time to heal most wounds, provided one actually wants to do the healing. A casual observer or tourist to this world might be struck by how pleasant much of it looks. A view of the late 22nd century evinces a sense of a world painted in watercolor, something ripped out of a solarpunk moodboard or a Chobani commercial. Aesthetically and technologically speaking this is most certainly the case. It is a world of colorful adobe houses and limewashed buildings, of floating turbines, airwells, solar furnaces and pedal powered machines. A time of bionic and folk-craft motifs and stained glass opening up into rooms of optical computers and bio-forges. Of bacteria-phages and gmo molds and mushrooms breaking down the remnants of the old plasticene. Of consciously designed permaculture landscapes around communes on one end and flowing linear arcologies on the other. Socially though? Politically? That’s a different story. The 22nd century is not a time of hand-holding, of positive psychology, utopian cosmopolitanism or down to earth anarchistic sentimentality. It is in many ways a return to form, a world emerging orthogonal from the past and its expectant future and containing bits of both on its own terms. It is a time of small states yet great empires, conservative communities, knightly orders and guild wars, at once an abandonment and refutation of the liberal and secular notions of the old globalized world in some cases and an attempt to race past them altogether in others. A time of close knit families and communes and bloody conflicts wiping out entire lands. Above all though it is a world that has abandoned the once popular maxim that “men are simply born for no reason”. For in the 22nd century all men have an end that they know, be it prescribed by their state, their community, their liege, their party, or their God. When the collapse came it was primarily those great global institutions and the social sentiments that had emerged alongside them which fared the worst. The United Nations, the internet, the global economy and so on, yes even air traffic control, all were dashed against the rocks. While states would return, communities would persist and dig deep roots, the idea of the liberal citizen, of the neutral state, of institutions that exist solely for the purpose of their own survival that would not. Those that survived the collapse and came to seize the 22nd century were those that were able to orient their societies towards specific ends, either that of a destined future or of building a kind of humanity and social order within their borders. The closest equivalent we might have is that of a “theocracy” though this is not entirely accurate. While many 22nd century states are oriented towards a kind of religious end or according to a specific cosmology, just as many are not, and many “secular” orders of the 22nd century (such a term being outmoded) in fact evolved out of the practical administrative structures of 21st century religious movements. Things are never quite so straightforward. The 22nd century itself is not even dominated by great powers in the way we would understand the word. For while one might look at a map and see a collection of states which contest land and people, the real powers of the era are different. As stated previously, the major multinational institutions and broader global framework of the 21st century did not survive, but there were some hangers on of the complex globalized society of the past that were able to maintain control and entrench themselves as modern superpowers by the 22nd century. These would turn out to be the descendants of the major charities and development banks, who having their own land, property, and people scattered across the world weathered the collapse and only became more powerful as the new order established itself. THE SUPERPOWERS AND KNIGHTS There are currently 12 (technically 13) superpowers or “orders” which dominate the world. They are the Society of Saint Joseph, Red Cross and Crescent, UNICEF, United Way, the Sravasti Viharas, Hare Khrishna, World Food Bank, Salvation Army, Nahdlatul Ulama, Tzu Chi Foundation, and both the African and Islamic Development Banks. The 13th will not be mentioned until later. With the exception of Saint Joseph which is based out of the Vatican (and formally a subordinate organ of the Catholic Church), none of the superpowers have any “home turf” as it were, instead contesting large swaths of non-contiguous land across the planet. There is not a single part of the world that does not see the presence of at least one of these powers. The origin of many of these powers is rather clear, though others are more particular. The Sravasti Viharas for instance are the descendants of a Western Tibetan Buddhist abbey turned Humanistic foundation which attained global prominence due to its interlinking with the similarly minded Fo Guang Shan of the Taiwanese diaspora in the middle 21st century. Others are the amalgamation of many groups over time, such as the Society of Saint Joseph which was formed as a result of a papal decree merging the church’s major foundations together under a new organization. The development banks are the “odd man out” in this regard, though their rise and persistence is for similar reasons, due to the massive amount of sway and resources that fell under such institutions’ control as the global south themselves attempted and failed to beat back the collapse. These development banks would find themselves being transformed from multilateral institutions to the caretakers of their former patrons, and so emerged from the collapse in a position of prominence. What one most often thinks of when the global superpowers come to mind however is not the land they contest nor their immense amount of wealth and vassals, but their knightly orders. Professional standing armies were one of the institutions that did not survive the 21st century in most parts of the world and are now the exception rather than the rule. While many states now have the potential to field standing armies again most do not due to institutional pressures against doing so that have become entrenched. Frankly speaking, most states view anything beyond a militia or at most a gendarmerie, to be a waste of time and resources. The superpowers are the notable exception to this, having the resources, funding, manpower, and reason to field large numbers of men at their command. The nature of warfare has changed however, and so have the kinds of men who fight. A big reason for this is technological developments in the past century and a half. In this world of bionics and organic technology one of the great shifts that would occur would be the (with caveats) victory of personal defense and armor over firearms. A great innovation of the modern era, organically grown heat regulating kinetic hardening foam has allowed for the creation of coats and breeches and other wearables that can deflect rounds with ease. Prohibitively expensive to be sure, but not impossible for the superpowers who have of course also locked down the process for creating them. Production costs limit the number of people that can be outfitted even by the wealthiest and most powerful bodies on Earth however. As such the superpowers rely on and use them to outfit small-ish professional corps of loyal soldiers, sworn to them for more or less life, to fight on their behalf. These form the basis of the modern knightly orders. Your average knight for the global superpowers then is exactly that, a man wearing effectively bulletproof quilted armor, often in layers starting with long undershirts and ending generally in either a large greatcoat or medium length jacket with roomy elbow length sleeves. Attached to the front (or sometimes the back) of their person is a bio-mechanical “third arm” folded against their body with an integrated weapon meant flip out and blow off exposed body parts should they be revealed during close combat. Close combat is in fact the name of the game, for although it is true that organic armor is effective against firearms, that simply inspired men to find new ways around them. The monomolecular sword would be this workaround, solving the issue of organic foam armor by simply slicing through it. A quirk of such weapons however is that due to the van der walls force a clean swipe will immediately seal right up, so sword combat between knights is based around hacking and slashing their enemy apart, and if possible blowing them apart with one’s prosthetic third arm should an opening arise. Large numbers of ordinary troops provide support and often operate drones and anti-drone weapons on the battlefield. As one can guess this means that knights require a lot of training, which makes them all the more of an investment that superpowers are desperate to hang onto. In many ways the knightly orders are an attempt to accommodate this, to give their fighting men not merely money but prestige and a kind of life and status that separates them from the hoi polloi. Knights are given great freedom in how they live their lives, access to land, and special exceptions to sumptuary laws. Knights are in many ways encouraged to take pride not merely in their work but in the symbols of it. This often takes the form of employing designers to create elaborate and specialized patterns and motifs on the outer layers of their armor and sometimes the insides of the coats and jackets too. There is no need to hide oneself after all, one might as well show off. Even calling them knights is intentional in this respect. Knights operate in fireteams or “lances” (equivalent to a squad of 8 or 10 men) headed by an operator. An “operator” is both a lance-leader and an intermediary, denoted by their special implants. Operators have two implants, one in their skull and one in their jaw, the former which turns thoughts into transmittable information, and the latter which picks up transmissions and uses bone conduction to allow it to be heard as if it were a human voice. Operators are paired to “handlers” who have matching implants. Handlers are stationed outside of the battlefield, often with other handers at one of their superpower’s local command stations, where through the use of drones, aerostats, and access to local infrastructure they have full view of the battlefield. Handlers and operators coordinate in battle and often develop a peculiar rapport with each other due to having access to each other’s thoughts on and off the battlefield. Despite the attempts by the superpowers to keep a lock on their knights it is not unheard of for some to go rogue, or in the case where a superpower loses a region to another for knights of the losing side to use the opportunity to move into freelancing for local states. There are some benefits to going from being one knight among many to being the only one or two of your kind that a county or even small nation leans on. THE AMERICAN ECUMENES Despite the previous statement that “theocracy” does not mean theocracy, the first states to be covered will be the American theodemocracies. Ultimately none of the contenders of the American War survived into the modern era, with the notable exception of a redoubt of the old Sacramento Government clinging on in Cascadia. Instead, it would be social clubs and faith communities that would persist as the national and later regional governments crumbled, forming the basis of a new post-American society. The “Ecumenical Societies” are a result of this, nations which privilege the church, mosque, temple and so on as the fundamental unit of civil society and government. Likewise, the national mythos of these states draw both from the collapse era experience and the religious traditions of their peoples, with most states being named after places in scripture, which can be a somewhat confusing prospect when someone says “the Land of Galilee” and they mean the region around Lake Winnipeg. Together the Ecumenical Conference of North America stretches across much of former North America, excluding the great desert of course. Among the conference though there are eight Ecumenes which are the most prominent, and which are most likely to be referenced when one talks about North America. First there is the Land of Gilead, based out of the former Northeast Atlantic. Gilead is perhaps the closest to an old fashioned party-state and indeed its constitution even references the communists and Lenin in particular (alongside the old fascist jurist Schmitt) as their ideological forebears. To Gilead all governments instituted by men are dictatorships in the name of a particular interest, with old world democracies themselves being bourgeois dictatorships. Similarly, civil society is a sorting system by which dictatorship is established, friends and enemies are designated, and the basis upon which the dictatorship distributes rewards and punishments is rationalized. Gilead is unique in that while being dominated by Catholics (with a significant folk element by way of its absorption of former Baptists and Methodists from the Appalachia area), it accedes to the old Communist maxim that a Communist party, in representing the interests of the proletariat and peasantry, is by its nature democratic because it makes as its main interest the majority of the population. This is one of the reasons why the ruling party, the Party for Solidarity and Virtue, modeled itself off of them. Where it diverges however is that to the people of Gilead the main question of governance is not who is ruled but who is sovereign. To the Gilead Party by instead attributing their primary interest to the ultimate sovereign: God, as opposed to the ultimate subject: Humanity, their regime has fixed the errs of previous capitalist and communist empires. The mentality of the people of Gilead can be summed up with the line “the previous exercise of government concerned itself with the question of what man says man is and of what interest is man to himself. We concern ourselves however with what God says man is and of what interest man is to God.” In terms of governance Gilead has been very successful, maintaining one of the more prosperous realms on the continent. This is helped by their monopoly on hydropower, not just the Niagara Falls Dam, but their recently successful megaproject of damming the James Bay as well. South of Gilead is the Land of Bethel. A unique specimen among Post-American states, the people of Bethel trace their roots in large part to the work of the Collapse Era “Community Welfare Alliance” or “CWAA” and smaller episcopal and progressive church cliques in the region. Heavily leaned on for the restoration of order and civil society during the Boston Government’s short time holding the Atlantic Coast, the “chapter houses” that they established would seize control of the state apparatus during the pretender state’s eventual retreat from the area. Modern day Bethel is a great example of what is meant when 22nd century states are called “conservative”, that is to say they focus heavily on the maintenance of social order and continuity of norms across generations. Communities in the 22nd century from the local to national level engage in high levels of social policing, which says nothing to what the norms of said society are. Bethel on this front is known particularly for its only national level organ the “Bureau for the Prevention of Vice”, under which their national gendarmerie, descended from the old CWAA, is organized. Bethel is also an example of what are sometimes referred to as “post-queer” societies, which is to say societies which had normalized certain social relations for sexual and gender minorities prior to the Collapse Era or which otherwise had influential cliques representing their interests which were maintained into the 22nd century. Post-Queer societies are quite common, more a reflection of the collapse of a social movement globally (due to the collapse of the world in general) not necessitating a reversal of social changes in specific regions, but instead attempts to reorient them within the new baseline of a much “smaller” and more parochial world, mostly through the mimicry of or full integration into the new regimes of social policing performed by the rest of society. Bethel for instance is well known for its program of free at point of use hormonal therapy for gender minorities and streamlined system to accommodate Self Identification, alongside having the death penalty for distribution of pornography of any kind. These two positions are considered to naturally exist hand-in-hand in Bethel society, and locals would be confused were one to attempt to argue with them that these are not positions one needs to hold to maintain social harmony and personal flourishing. Further south is the Land of Goshen. A descendant of the once great Internationalist Commune of Dixie, the people of Goshen still use a modified version of their ancestors’ flag. The system of municipal communes and horse-trading which dominated Dixie politics and their erstwhile congress would eventually form the basis of the current system of elector councils. Goshen in large part is dominated by the “Southron Church”, formally an ecumenical board jointly held by the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African National Baptist Convention, which rose in prominence with the spinning apart of the once dominant Southern Baptist Convention. Goshen is made up of elector districts, which are headed by either secular or religious councils depending on if the local voting authority is centered around the town hall or church board. The elector districts select members for the congress which is the supreme authority of the land. Elector councils often band together into larger administrative federations where they coordinate and draft fiscal policy and direct the operation of infrastructure manned by cooperatives or other socially owned enterprises that contain members from their respective districts. In some cases this manifests as unofficial “party” blocs, often along the lines of the old school commune era divisions of agrarians, romantics, and communists though as a formally non-partisan state they are not called such. Secular and religious electors are generally equal in number, but due to the near unanimous allegiance of religious electors to the Southron Church (and the semi-formalized process of the church sending notices of whom they want their electors to send to congress) the nation is in dominated by the church. Goshen, however, is also noteworthy for its parallel systems of law enforcement, with both a national militia (descended from the Southern People’s Liberation Army) and a “knightly board”. Goshen prefers to leverage the services of independent knights and reiters, formerly sworn to the superpowers, for mediating disputes between councils and counties. This is a very attractive offer, especially for older knights who wish to enter a kind of “retirement”. Goshen’s independent knights often hail from UNICEF or the United Way due to the region being further away from their zones of control and firmly held under the Red Cross. Speaking of crosses, Goshen is famous for its yearly Victory Day celebrations which commemorate the triumph of the old Dixie armies over the Black Cross in the American War. Celebrations typically consist of work battalions, dressed up in Collapse Era uniforms, dragging replica Black Cross flags through the mud, culminating in their public burning. Victory Day is also noteworthy for the flying of flags of those nations and foreign militias that aided Dixie in the conflict. As those states no longer exist today, a Goshen town or city on Victory Day is one of the last places on Earth one might see many 21st century flags still flown. Back north one of the descendants of Old Exurbia, now known as the Land of Canaan, can be found. Still based around its old quasi-capital of Tecumseh (former Columbus). The history of Canaan is just as off kilter and curious as its predecessor. The Exurbians had always been a peculiar deviation away from the communalists they were inspired by, attempting a far more “pure” framework trending towards generalized anarchy alongside a kind of American cultural revolution. A people carried aloft as much by an affinity for witchcraft and new age syncretism as they were by their grungecore “i’m playing a riotgrrrl track in a blasted out shopping mall” war of extermination against fascism. As such it is only fitting that it met an equally punk end. Which is to say that one day the men came home from the frontier, turned their guns on everyone and declared they would be doing full anarchism now. All in all it’s been pretty successful actually. Canaan has maintained, for roughly 80 years now, more or less a vacuity of any form of government outside of the People’s Guard. Beyond that, among the other Ecumenes it is also noted for its relative lack of any hard religious structures. The “Hexurbian” witches of the olden days gave way to a kind of neo-neo-pentecostal campbellism, where much like everything else the existence of discrete denominations was dismantled by force. A form of highly charismatic primitive Christianity dominates in this area, influencing the social norms and sensibilities of the people, even those unaffiliated among them. In terms of foreign relations everything is carried out by the People’s Guard which maintains a rotating roster of diplomatic posts for its officers. Despite not being able to predict who you’re talking to when conducting relations with the Canaanites the neighboring states have maintained long lasing positive relations with the anti-state, in part a continuation of the unofficial détente that existed between Exurbia and the pretender governments from back in the Hayes era. Speaking of Hayes and the Chicago Government, while that particular pretender no longer exists, Chicago itself is a major power in the new North America. Influenced by the region’s overlapping periods of control under the Chicago Government, the Quasi-Islamic National Rejuvenation Government, and the Sabaothic Host of the Prophetess Daniela and her followers, what emerged from the wake of the collapse era was the Land of Shiloh. An experiment in confessionalism, Shiloh’s government reflects the diversity of its population. A form of power-sharing is the name of the game, with the Shiloh constitution having built in administrative carveouts for Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, Muslims, Unitarians, Sabaothists, and the Baha’is. Although Shiloh is a state dominated by the public interchange of and horse-trading between different religious communities, above all of them exists a sort of public quasi-cult dedicated to the image and mission of the former United States. This is in large part due to the significant influence that various pretender governments, from Chicago, to the PNRG, to the South Dakota state government of the old 130th Division, played in laying the groundwork for its founding. President Hayes in particular is considered a folk hero of immense renown, for both preventing the fall of the region to fascism and stopping a potential nuclear exchange in the 2040s that would have devastated the continent. A somewhat amusing cultural divergence in this region, though often unremarked upon, was the effect that the ration-passport system of the Chicago Government played in shaping demographics. The Hayes era system (and its carry-ons during the later collapse) unintentionally encouraged diverse cohabitation of houses and compounds and what were known as “breadline marriages” in order to maximize access to goods and dispenser regions through the ration system. In effect everyone sharing a house or living on a street became a “family”. Across the Midwest it becomes difficult to trace ancestry back beyond the 2030s. A person’s last name thus might be Mattox because their “ancestors” all lived in the same building on Mattox street a century and a half ago. A similar expression of this phenomena can also be found in the region once known as Colorado, though to a more muted degree. Among the former states of the Texan led provisional government now stands the Land of Samaria. Samaria is descended from the “ProvGov” as it was called, more specifically from a special agreement between the Texan and Mexican security and intelligence services that during the later collapse period formed the basis of a multinational program to respond to the regional collapse, desertification and devastation of the gulf coast, and ensuing refugee waves, a program that would survive both nations. The formal dissolution of the remaining American pretender government in Austin would come shortly after its last motion, to begin the movement of millions of people from Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Mexico to the region now known as Samaria. After everything America might die but her people would survive if the Texans had anything to say about it. The Promised Land of the Texan and Louisianan pinewoods and oak cut prairies would prove to be the perfect place to begin again, and in time even the abandoned cities of Dallas and Fort Worth would be repopulated and reforged to serve as the current capitol of Samaria. Surprisingly retaining many of the institutions of the collapse era, Samaria is a federal republic with a presidency and a unicameral congress, though operating under a church-county system similar to neighboring Goshen. The success of the resettlement program gave the people of Samaria a sense of good government and the belief that a state properly staffed by the competent (and most importantly the virtuous) will always prevail. This means that the Samaritan government tends to be staffed by competent and well oriented people promoted not due to personal ambition or typical mechanistic meritocratic means, but by being forced into ever higher positions of responsibility by the ever watchful community, often beginning with the chittering of elderly women at the front rows of one’s church or the murmuring of men at the local social club. As they like to say, no good Samaritan goes unpunished. This has also led to the phenomenon in Samaria known as “Republican Nobility”, a kind of informal class position among the administrative upper crust of the state (and their immediate family) who due to the popular belief that their position was a result of their moral character are simply treated far better by all of society and are often encouraged to flaunt their status. A man who is rich because he owns property is considered an accident of history in Samarian culture and has no right to boast, whereas one who has served the people faithfully is believed to deserve to be rich and often made so. Far up north around Lake Winnipeg is the Land of Galilee. Along with its sisterland of Sidon to the west, Galilee is of importance less for any particular difference in its government, but due to its ruling myth and recent history. Like most of the ecumenical states in former Canada its origins can be traced back to the fall of the NATO regime in the country, and in the case of Galilee the beginning of it as well. Galilee stands at the crossroads of many mystical events in the recent history of the continent, having been the site of the Prophetess Daniela’s invasion of Canada which sparked the occupation in the first place. Galilee, like most Canadian states is known for a sizeable though not majority Sabaothic population, the religion having experienced a boost in the region after the fall of the faith’s own personal Babylon. What Galilee is more often known for however is the story of Terrance and the Miraculous Blade. In the latter half of the 21st century as the NATO regime and its local RCMP proxies increased in the intensity of their barbarism against the Canadian people, crackdowns would begin on all public gatherings in an attempt to break up hostile cells. Terrance Gauthier (otherwise known as St. Terrance) was a lay preacher, one of the many kinds of “wildflower” spokesmen that emerged at the time as an act of defiance following NATO’s retreat from Alberta. The wildflowers were a broad classification of dissident, including everything from religious preachers, to communists, to people who supported the return of democracy, to simply anyone the military government didn’t like. It is unknown if Terrance was originally a religious wildflower, but he eventually became one, leading to the local RCMP detachment to believe he was involved in or otherwise knew about the location of several dissident cells. He was not and did not. Repeated failures to make any headway by surveilling Terrance caused his observers to become frustrated and spiteful, changing plans first to assaulting Terrance to get information out of him to eventually simply looking for an excuse to kill him outright. Everything from having his house seized to his church closed down and fellow parishioners arrested did not bring Terrance to violence. Finally, an attempt to encourage him to assault an officer by pulling him into the middle of the road and beating him backfired and resulted in him running away, leading to the Mounties chasing after him and shooting him in the leg. As Terrance began to bleed out in the middle of a clearing the Mounties surrounded him with their weapons raised. Terrance raised his hand into the air, which one interpreted as him having finally broken and offering to give him whatever information they believed he might have. Instead, Terrance told them that he would show them a miracle. Looking up to the sky he said: “Lord, not that I might gain, or bargain for my life with your power, but that they who persecute me might be saved. That if you will that they might know you by my faith. For you are the author of life, and if it be your will then this air though it remain in sight and touch air will be in truth a blade that should I grab it would cut my hand.” Terrance would grasp the air above his head. His palm would be sliced open and start to bleed. The Mounties would panic and shoot him seven times. The final collapse of Canada would mean Terrance would have the last laugh, and indeed the story goes that at least a couple of those who witnessed the event would later switch sides, with their testimonies being why the story was popularized in the first place. So, he arguably obtained all his goals. He’s considered the national hero of modern-day Galilee and the saint-of-the-nation by the region’s Catholic and Lutheran believers. Finally there is the Land of Sidon. A recent arrival in the history of Post-American states, it is of great renown due to its ongoing rivalry with neighboring Cascadia. Formally “The United States of America”, Cascadia is what remains of the once great Sacramento Government and its ruling body COMPOR. Based around the former military regime in PNW and the Seattle Green Zone, the remnant state has succeeded in solidifying its rule, due to celebrate the 400th year anniversary of the USA soon! A unitary government despite the name, Cascadia can be best described as a “cop-ocracy” in service to the cartels and corporations which dominated the old government, now reforged into what are effectively a kind of ancien nobility, an anachronism wrapped in another anachronism. Sidon is dedicated to the destruction of what remains of the USA, or what it perceives to be a mockery of the world that was lost during the collapse. The cold war between Sidon and Cascadia is playing out primarily in the city of Vancouver, which remains for now outside the reach of either power. A cat and mouse game is afoot between both sides, constantly attempting to outmaneuver and undo the other’s inroads into the free city, which all sides know will fall to one side eventually. Among the ecumenes of North America a phenomenon has emerged in recent years, that of the “New Believers”, those individuals who come from secular or explicitly atheist families going back 3 or more generations that have at least outwardly converted to a local religion following the rise of the new system. To be clear there were seismic shifts and trends in religiosity in America during the collapse era, though a sizeable chunk of the population remained otherwise stable in previously held secularity as is to be expected, operating as normal under the new system as it gelled. However, trends have been noticed in recent years, especially by those who collect the stats, of segments of the population that did not shift over the past century, but which have now experienced seemingly spontaneous changes in outward religiosity after the new order became entrenched, often corresponding to areas or among those institutions where doing so would be more beneficial. The rise of New Believers is more pronounced in Shiloh for instance with its confessional appointment system, than in Goshen where there is a whole parallel secular state. In recent years these New Believers have experienced a degree of mistrust and wariness accorded to them by some segments of the population, though this has yet to escalate beyond the level of a kind of cultural background radiation. As a result it is not unheard of for New Believers to find themselves needing to express an even more intense religiosity and loyalty to compensate or otherwise “prove” themselves to their detractors. Outside of the ecumenes and Cascadia there is not much to note about the rest of the continent with two exceptions. The first is the Heartland Commonwealth, a state stretching from former Utah to Kansas which considers itself the legal and spiritual successor to the Chicago Government, though having dropped the pretenses of being the sole American state. Known for their massive solar powered fixed wing transport planes that lazily circuit the whole perimeter of their nation and the pilotless caravans that move across the plains, the Heartlanders are in an almost romantic recreation of an American ideal interested in little more than friendly neighbors and profitable trade. There is also the San Fran Commune, an quasi-outpost of the Seventh International on American shores. They, however, will have to be touched on later. THE SINITIC META-CIVILIZATION As it turns out the fall of the People’s Republic during the collapse was not enough to get communism out of the blood of the Chinese people. As any visitor to the far east will tell you, that particular quirk is here to stay. Today every Chinese state is officially some form of communist or socialist, and all claim to be the (or at least a) successor to the People’s Republic. There is, amusingly, a legal continuity of government regime of the old PRC still operating in Taiwan, and the ruling party of the island is on paper at least well within its rights to claim that it is the CPC, but to be frank nobody really cares. The 30 states of the Chinese people represent their own kind of world, all viewing each other as reflections of the same shared legacy of “Chinese Civilizational Socialism”, though descended from different institutions, organs, and movements of the old empire that once dominated the land. The Third People’s Republic, based out of its capital of Xiong’an, is a unitary state that emerged out of a collapse era stewardship program established by China’s major state enterprises. Headed by the Continuing Committee, a descendant of the CPC Central Committee now staffed primarily by technical specialists and a consultative simulated intelligence that runs the economy, the TPR is often described as a kind of “People’s Technocracy”. Despite its heavily centralized state apparatus and potential to leverage immense amounts of power domestically, the TPR prefers to leave its people alone, operating under the belief that the continuing committee should only exist as a caretaker administration for a society that no longer needs to be ruled. To this end it has sought to make its regime at once flexible and ever present while also unobtrusive and has just recently abolished all taxation within its borders. The TPR is also known for its romanticism of early collapse era China, which it sees as the height of Chinese civilization both in terms of reach and cultural attainment. The TPR maintains a great deal of influence to its north, in the lands of former Mongolia and Siberian Russia, where Chinese settler states dominate. South of the TPR is the realm known as the Prefectural Confederation. Best described as an anarcho-syndicalist state, the Confederation is composed of a number of arcology communes and organizing committees composed of trade union representatives. This arrangement was the result of two main factors, first was the resettlement of large chunks of the coastal population to new inland linear arcologies as the sea level rose, and the second was what were known as the “two card reforms”. An attempt in the 21st century to transition away from reliance on enterprise unions, the ACFTU embarked on a program of expanding trade union participation by forming local sector unions to exist alongside enterprise-wide unions. These were known as the “two card reforms” due to the long period when many Chinese workers would be a part of two separate unions in the same work place and thus had two union cards. The success of the reforms was mixed, but it took hold deep in Jiangsu and Shandong where climate change would actually accelerate the transition in workplace structures as people had to physically move and restart their lives in the new linear arcologies. With the fall of the PRC the local workplace committees would strike, coopting the administrative structure given to them and organizing the network of arcologies along the lines of a dual communal congress and trade union senate structure. Today the Prefectural Confederation is seen as a kind of intermediate zone, largely uninvolved in the affairs of its neighbors and thought of as a region separating the north from the Malkutic states to the south. Before we go further south we will return to the north (and then the west briefly) to speak about the Liaoyang Ecological Secretariat. Descended from the United Front Work Group Coordinating Committee for An Ecological Socialist Civilization (try saying that five times fast), the LES was originally a regional sub-board representing Liaoning, Jilin, and North Korea. While both the PRC and DPRK would fall (though the latter not before unifying the peninsula) the board would not, maintaining a stranglehold on the region. The modern-day secretariat, which still calls itself a mere secretariat due to officially waiting for the legitimate PRC government to reassert itself, is most known for its ambitious program of ecological rehabilitation and radical self-reliance. While sometimes amusingly called an “Eco-Juche” state few can argue against its effectiveness, with its stunning resuscitation of the continent’s bee population earning it the other nickname “The Apiary”. The Secretariat is also known for its ongoing program of settling Outer Manchuria and the Amur Basin and subverting local governments to bring them more in line with its long-term program of creating a “Northeast People’s Bioregion”. It may be worth checking back in at the turn of the 23rd century to see how that plays out. In the meantime, the Secretariat currently inspires a lot of thrillers based around its clandestine operations. To the west is the aptly named Agency for the Western Domain. An intersection of two developments in late pre-collapse Chinese history, the expanding control over and resettlement of minority populations from the peripheral zones of the southwest (Zomia) and the security regimes established in the western territories of the old empire. During the collapse era local minorities began to take on greater roles in the administration of the local military apparatus due to the explosion in military enlistment as an avenue of social mobility. The resettled peoples of Yunnan such as the Lisu increasingly found themselves under the control of co-ethnic garrisons supported by the capital and party committees, as were the Uyghurs, Tibetans, Tu and so on. As the PRC waned the mission of these local ad-hoc regimes continued, ultimately coalescing under the army and police structures that they all shared. The Agency for the Western Domain then is a latter-day Protectorate General to Pacify the West as it were, though its size and complexity dwarfs that of even some old dynasties. History might not repeat but it does often rhyme. Of course the agency is self-governing, and over the generations has ironically become rather thoroughly Islamized. An exceptionally proud nation, it maintains the air that it is the bulwark of Chinese civilization, the shield that protects the heartland (that it in theory is still beholden to) from the vicissitudes of the outside world. It also makes money hand over first in trade, having seized control of almost all of the major overland transport infrastructure of old Eurasia, but that’s neither here nor there. South China is most known for its system called the Malkutate. Its full name is the All-China Apostolic Malkutate. An evolution of the successful program to Sinicize Christianity, the Malkutate is at once an imperial church and a sort of memetic or cultural space. Derived from Malkuth or “Kingdom”, the counter-oriented sefirot to Keter or “Crown”, Malkuth comes from creation itself, governs it and gives it sensibility, and exists in, through, and among the material world and human person when it reflects and is oriented towards God. It is also the mediative sefirot that in its reflection connects all of God’s emanations back to the top. In Christian Kabbalistic traditions it is manifested in the unity of mankind with God and Heaven as the Bride through the Church, and the Church as the community of all believers living, dead, and eternally alive (the saints). The implications of such a concept were seized on by the post-PRC communist church, to rhetorically justify and create a framework for a kind of “bottom-up” society, one beginning at the communal level, at the workshop, and the work battalion, directing itself towards the end of the salvation of the Chinese people. The Malkutitic system is also known for its re-nestling of Chinese cosmology in this new era. For instance, the age-old idea in Chinese spirituality that Heaven or God is that which, grounding being itself, possesses a will that attempts to unify a humanity that is not naturally or intentionally separate from it but only contingently so towards itself as having been wholly expressed in history with the reconciliation of God with man in the person of Jesus. Likewise that immortality, the ultimate aim and telos of fusus, the subject, or the universal logic and that which it ultimately trends towards, is fully realized by and in Christ as the Resurrection. Malkutism essentially creates for itself a space to realize the re-establishment of a neo classical Chinese cosmology sublimated into an Abrahamic typological framework and thus a re-enchantment of Chinese civilization, with a Communistic society and a Christian cosmology as their final form. A common motif found in Malkutic states reflects this in a snapshot image of the big dipper in the four phases or seasons around an image of the three heavens (three circles expanding outwards) while four stars (no longer representing distinct classes as they did on the old PRC flag but the totality of the Chinese people) trailing behind the tail. Similarities have been remarked upon between many Malkutate patterns and the patterns of the old Ming era magic square banners, though this is believed to be a kind of convergent re-development of a related aesthetic style rather than an intentional move. Malkutic states are, reflecting the broader culture, more or less universally Workers’ republics: self-governing communal federations often with a ceremonial party on top. The federations give way beyond the state level to the Ecclesiastical Conference which itself acts as a consultative organ back to the communes and parish-cadres: a circular system. Among the Malkutates themselves though two are often mentioned the most. The Sichuan and Huanan Workers’ Republics. Generally considered the “elder brothers” or sometimes “elder brother and sister” (which is which depends on who you ask) of South China, these two states are the ones that their cousins generally entrust the maintenance of foreign relations and the region’s standing army (an exception among world powers as noted earlier) to. THE CARIBO-MEXICAN TECHNOCRACIES Those who have visited the great states of the Caribbean describe it as a place somewhat out of time, a vision of a future that never arrived. Dominated by the twin republics of Santo Domingo and Centroamérica, the Caribbean technocracies emerged out of the alliance formed between the rising Latin American security states and the ICS regime established to loot the former United States. Truly incalculable amounts of wealth flowed into the region, which was kept aloft out of the interest of the UN led order during the early years of the collapse. Wealth when properly managed begets more wealth, such is the clarion call of the capitalist, and indeed it did. Today the two republics are some of the richest parts of the globe, their technocratic and highly professional elite in service to a unified banking regime. A microcosm of the perfected global market as envisioned by the Rockefellers and Carnegies long ago. The Latins would claim to have at last perfected the free market, though such a statement would most definitely cause their neighbors to the south to bristle. To the west are the Mexicans, their less successful cousins, though not for a lack of trying! Mexico simply could not survive the collapse in one piece, though the memory of a once unified regime that achieved great feats even during the collapse era still burns bright. The mission of the Alineados is nothing short of the restoration of the old institutional dictatorship, though it varies whether one means that of PRI era or the collapse era SSPC government. The answer is often a bit of both. The main issue is that while everyone can agree on “what needs to be done” all wish to be the master and none the subordinate. How long this “Mexican Standoff” will last is anyone’s guess, but once it does the balance of power in the region is bound to shift again. THE KRASNODAR AGREEMENT The candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long… but boy did it burn everything around it in the meanwhile. During the collapse the Three Flags Army and their Democratic Federation tore through much of Eurasia, eventually toppling not just most of the states of the Middle East and North Africa but Pakistan and Central Asia as well, culminating in them even landing a killing blow on the Russian state to the north which caused the Russian Federation to spin apart into civil war. The great DemFed no longer exists, though at its height it vied even with China for dominance of the Fifth International. What came in its wake are the states of the modern day Krasnodar Agreement. Chief among them is the Eurasian Compact, the inheritor of the DemFed regime in Western Russia and Kazakhstan. The Eurasian Compact is closest to that of the old Three Flags system in terms of its implementation of Democratic Confederalism, though this system is referred to as a “self-strengthening society” in local parlance. The Compact is so named because it was not originally a state but a regional conference of smaller DemFed successor states that stretched from Romania to Siberia. The coalescing of these states into one body is a somewhat recent event, a result of a coup of the local governments by the Red Cross and Crescent which pushed for their unification to more easily manage its knightly realm in continental Eurasia. This coup happened simultaneously with a strike against the states of the North Atlantic to bring them into the fold. As the superpower suzerain has no particular preferences regarding the form of local government there were no barriers set up against reorganizing the newly conquered territory along DemFed lines by their subjects. Despite a greater alignment with orthodox DemFed doctrine the Eurasians have their own quirks. While a multi-religious society dominated by strains of Christianity and Islam as in most of the DemFed inheritors, the dominance of the Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians, and Romanians has made the Eurasian Compact the unofficially official defender of global Orthodox Christianity. Some things never change, and as it turns out not even the end of the world can beat that out of the Eastern Europeans, a point which they take pride in. The Municipal Union of Iran and the Yusufzaid Conference are two examples of local regimes and powerplayers having taken advantage of the DemFed in the long term. The Iranians were quick to capitalize on the fall of unified federation, keeping the municipal structure inherited by its quasi-anarchistic predecessors and reestablishing a national government in the form of an “emergency organizing committee” to coordinate them. The Organizing Committee in time became the new state, slowly subverting the power of the local committees and replacing them with centrally chosen delegates. The modern municipal union maintains a relatively unobtrusive approach to governance with most politics remaining local and horizontal, but increasingly even that has started to give way with the establishment of the “national congress for delegation and supervision” a system in which the people of Iran choose who to staff the congress with which then gives directives to the municipal governments and invests itself with the ability to recall delegates back to the capitol. Of particular note in recent history is the congress’ passage of a motion to create an autonomous clerical city state out of the city of Qom. This idea of a “Shia Vatican”, first floated over 200 years ago has in a twist become a symbol for the growing legitimacy and sovereignty of the union and congress, with some believing it may presage a larger reform to the municipal system in the coming decades. The Yusufzaid Conference is a result of the DemFed’s inability to completely end the Taliban Regime which ultimately outlasted it. That said, the Taliban’s third victory would prove to be its last. The collapse would precipitate a massive movement from the DemFed lands through western Afghanistan and into the growing yet safer grasslands of North India and Tibet. The Third Taliban regime would be forced to direct the resettlement of millions of people, leading to upstart generals and members of military families that had emerged during the Islamic Emirate’s time ruling the area to rise up and declare themselves stewards and emirs of what were effectively new warlord states. These “emirs” would then somewhat amusingly find themselves couped by their own military and district court administrations, who would establish the Yusufzaid Conference. The modern day Conference is a mishmash of the DemFed confederal system and the later Taliban juristic government, in effect a society run by courts, and panels, and ad-hoc democratic councils, all spiraling upwards to the Supreme Court. The Conference has even done away with a head of government entirely, and although not the only country to have done so, the government of the Conference does make knowing who you are talking to when you can talk to them at all a bit confusing. That said they do make sure to have one office dedicated just for the representative sent to Krasnodar. The Hayastani Empire is exactly what it says on the tin. It is not some great inheritor of the DemFed, nor is it the consequence of some kind of quirk of history, ironic wrinkle, or esoteric political philosophy. It is straight up just the result of the Armenians rising up and killing everyone when the opportunity presented itself. That said, they actually get along well enough with their neighbors, in part because they form a lynchpin of the inter-Eurasian infrastructure network, and so were grandfathered into the Krasnodar Agreement. They also have very positive relations with the local Islamist Hasanids for helping their predecessors conquer Israel. A real sort of “you scratch my back” thing going on there. Some might call that cynical, they call it good policy. THE UNIVERSALIST FRATERNITIES AND EURO-CATHOLICS As stated earlier, the Society of Saint Joseph is unique among the superpowers for having a “home” as it were, that being the Vatican and the Papal States. It is perhaps more accurate to state that the Knights of Saint Joseph created the Papal States for the Vatican though. During the collapse the nascent European federal system couldn’t bear the strain (it was never meant to), and as the world became less hospitable waves of refugees flooded inland Europe. The real breaking point however didn’t come from those fleeing from the Middle East or Africa (especially not with the DemFed locking them down on the one end and the remaining local regimes glassing their own people down to atoms on the other) but from within Europe itself. Tens of millions of people from the Mediterranean states, from Italy, Spain, Portugal and so on, completely swarmed the German, French, and Lowland countryside causing the spine of the European system to snap. What came in its wake were a series of “Latin” warlord states, descended from the crafty and guileful people during the collapse years that carved out their own petty realms from the old EU. It was during this time with the fall of the Italian regime that the predecessors to the Society of Saint Joseph struck, declaring a state in the interest of his majesty the Vicar of Christ, and for the welfare of the Italian people in preparation for the coming struggle. As you can probably guess from the map they succeeded. The modern Papal States are actually a series of small “marches” ruled by Knight-Marquises spiraling outward from the eternal city. Rome itself is encased in a massive climate controlled geodesic dome with an internal smart layer that projects the view of the outside world for those inside. While Pope Sixtus VII is in theory the absolute monarch of the realm he delegates almost all temporal duties, a consequence of the papacy having gotten used to not ruling directly during the interregnum between the two stately eras perhaps. That said alongside the Society of Saint Joseph there are actually two special “zones of control” legally subordinate to the Throne of Peter. The first is the Veil of Our Lady of Fatima. In an interesting twist, despite the sort of external formal religiosity of the warlord states, religious feelings actually correlated negatively with one’s tendency to leave the Mediterranean during the collapse. A part of this is because it was tied more strongly with patriotism and thus a reluctance to leave one’s home, but in Portugal it has a lot to do with Fatima. One of the declarations of Fatima, which according to believers was given by Mary herself, was that in Portugal the Catholic Faith would always persevere. For the most devout Catholics then the question of to stay or go became a matter of loyalty. Would they make their lady a liar? Those who stayed then were often the most religious and did so in the name of piety and prophecy, and so the Veil (as in land of) Our Lady of Fatima was born. The Union of Saint Mark is a little bit different, and its history is somewhat muddled. Much like in the case of the Hayastanis when the DemFed regime in North Africa spun apart the Copts rose up, though this was more in the form of a powerplay to seize control of the local communes and municipalities that they controlled under the Federation. The fall of the DemFed hit Egypt especially hard, resulting in generations of civil war until the solidification of two (three) regimes in the north, and the seizure of the lands around the Upper Nile by the Coptic militias. Sometime following this officially (though it has been suggested by many that an agreement had been hashed out during the war) an agreement to formally end the intra-coptic schism between the CCC and COC by bringing the Coptic Church fully under Rome was finalized. Operating today as an autonomous church realm beholden to no other state but Rome, this would be considered a much bigger win for the Catholics were it not for everything else that’s happened in the past century and a half. Back in Europe the mainland Euro-Catholic realms are dominated by two states, the Greater Polish Commonwealth and the Republic of Hungary. Both claim an unbroken continuity with their pre-collapse governments and can for the most part prove it. Having affirmed loyalty to Rome before it was cool and managing not to commit suicide like their western brethren, Poland and Hungary are considered the senior states of the “Western World” in the 22nd century (what exactly the West means nowadays though is up to debate). The two republics are what are known as “Royal Republics” which is to say that on paper both have a designated king: God. The Latin states further west consider this to be kinda pretentious and performative, but they’re not exactly in any position to make demands, especially since the easterners have nukes that work and infinite Popebux. That said, while all might seem rosy on the surface the truth is that Poland and Hungary don’t really like each other and have had an informal rivalry for generations now. Familiarity and a shared border breed contempt as it were. This is also because the Poles outnumber the Hungarians several times over. Recently the Hungarians have been forming their own club of nations known as the Union of Saint Stephen (yeah, after the crown and stuff) in an attempt to counteract Polish dominance in the region. This will backfire sometime in the 23rd century and lead to a convoluted series of events that ends in both getting upstaged by the Germans again. It’s gonna be really funny. THE INTERNATIONAL It’s been over three centuries now and yet the communists still refuse to tap out. If anything they’re experiencing a second wind. The Seventh International stands abreast once more as the vanguard of the international workingman and the promise of a new society. With the collapse many accepted the end of global society as it had once been understood, dominated by its sprawling institutions and models of an international citizenry. Yet even in the face of Armageddon, where the powers of old Earth with their Metternichs and Guizots, radicals and police-spies saw a new reality to accept the revolutionary communist movement saw a challenge to be answered. A global society would not be abandoned, no they would instead double down on it and go all in. The dream of the International in those heady hazy days was once that there would be no nations, there would be no compromise, there would be one world republic with one party for one people, and so it is again… more or less. Headed out of Karl Marx City (formerly Manilla) the International is the last truly global state aside from the superpowers, in many ways the last beacon of the pre-collapse world in its own sense. It is a somewhat indistinct unitary agglomeration of counties and prefectures organized under a one party proletarian dictatorship. In practice however a kind of four realm federalism has become the norm. There is the core territory where the world-republic is situated in the Pacific, but there are also its Western, Southern, and Eastern flanks. Based out of Indochina, Australia, and the Andes respectively these realms function in the same way as the core, though under a cadet branch of the communist party designated cardinally (surprise, the party in the southern flank is called the Communist Party – South). Beyond these regions are prospective states at various stages of integration into the International. In these states the long and arduous process of unifying them with world-republic’s standards and practices and absorbing their national communist party into THE communist party is ongoing. In some cases this is intentionally delayed such as in Taiwan. The island nation which is technically speaking the legal continuation of the old PRC, is an associate member of the International but has delayed integration for years as doing so would require admitting that the mainland is lost to them. As for the mainland, despite being various flavors of communist and socialist themselves they have all shown no interest in joining the International, content with their own little world. The prestige of the International has been bolstered in recent generations by them being the only power to try to challenge the superpowers on their own turf. The Bondsmen are the International’s answer to the Knightly Orders. The watchmen of the workingman and the defenders of the downtrodden the Bondsmen were so named on an account of conscious subversion, that the name of an institution that once served to merely protect the accounts of states and the ruling class might now be taken for the interest of the common man. The Bondsmen are sometimes referred to as Knights in themselves, as they are categorically of the same kind of military order, and so are colloquially known as the “Knights of Communism”. They too have handlers and operators and lance-leaders and armors of bio-foam and silks with swords slung on their backs, but they also have under that a much larger class of petty-knights called “Runners”. Runners don’t have access to full sets of armor like Full-Knights nor do they have mono-swords, though they may be seen wearing a rigid biofoam tabard along with a third arm stabilizer for their rifles. Runners often operate solo or in fireteams usually with a line back to a nearby stationed Full-Knight. Runners are employed en masse by the International to hunt down scammers, traffickers, time thieves (individuals who manipulate automatic work-chit systems to shave off money from large numbers of workers’ paychecks), and other ne’er-do-wells. Both Runners and Full-Knights are considered Bondsmen, and in the popular imagination it is actually the former that dominates. Chief among the Bondsmen in the popular imagination is probably Jomari Galang, more commonly known as Comrade Casanova. A globetrotting Runner and heart-breaker extraordinaire his exploits have become the thing of legends. Not just because his missions have taken him to every continent (even Antarctica!) but because of the sheer scale and danger of the tasks he takes on armed with just his trusty gun and the support of his best friend Yu. From single handedly defeating a Hare Krishna aerial flotilla and bailing out over the Pacific as it exploded, to stopping a mad techno-wizard from using collapse era nanobots to force Yellowstone to erupt, to seducing an aristocratic ReNoCo belle in former Colombia (considered the most impressive of the three!), Jomari has become the stuff of legends such that posters of his face grace the streets of even non-international cities and whole series of only somewhat dramatized books about his adventures can be found even in the Vatican. Outside of the International Proper there are associated and peripheral states, those “friends of the International” who for whatever reason are not interested in the mission of the world-republic even in terms of paying lip service. The closest are the associated states, who send observers to Karl Marx City as opposed to opening up embassies like non-communist or non-affiliated states do. The San Francisco Commune, formed out of the wreckage of the Sacramento Government, is one such example. Maoist in its bent though centered around a thoroughly re-industrialized Bay Area, the people of San Fran have succeeded in establishing the first truly cybernetic commune on Earth. Its refusal to join the International is rather straightforward as its ascension would risk an immediate intervention by its neighbors. As such it maintains a formal separation as an associated state but is understood to be the closest of all those not fully within the International. Among the other associated states are the Azanian Congressional Republic and the Sovereign Republic of India. In the case of the former, Azania is descended from the collapse era EFF regime of former South Africa, the last gasp of old-school Pan-Africanist Marxism-Leninism. It is for this reason though that it refuses to join the International. The Congress first and foremost prides itself as being the rightful government of all Africa (and has in its charter a declaration that it is the successor to the African Union), meant to represent African interests to the rest of the world. To join the International as a full member would negate the entire purpose of their regime, or so the current attitude is. The Sovereign Republic of India is a more curious matter in that it is no longer a communist regime. Founded during the collapse as part of a “nationally oriented communist patriot movement” against the Naxalites and in order to lay claim to the legal mantle of the Indian Republic, the Sovereigntists seized control of the south and began a program of economic consolidation, rationalization, and anti-corruption. This however had an unintended effect in the long term, as the period of industrial downturn during the collapse created pressures away from traditional party policy and towards a need to instead capture what fledgling regional markets persisted through the height of the collapse years. What resulted was South India’s transformation from a Worker’s Republic to a Mercantile Republic, which as of the 22nd century is dominated by its megacorporations (formally cooperatives) and their massive ocean-going fleets. It however is positively disposed to the International for cultural and historical reasons, viewing the communists as their friends (and some megacorp leaderships even view themselves as distributed socialist states in their own right as opposed to private enterprises) and thus maintains an awkward (for the International) yet mutually beneficial relationship. Peripheral States are those who have ideological divergences with the International, not aligning with their particular brand(s) of communism, yet which still seek to maintain friendly and somewhat close relations, if more distant than the associates, with them in the name of socialism. First among them is the Democratic Union, otherwise known as the Originalist Union. A result of the long-term entrenchment of the native resistance movement, it is a society of constant struggle against bourgeois interests and encroachment that once turned against the Mexican state is now arrayed against the technocratic order of the new world. The Democratic Union has no particular ideological or governmental norms beyond that which can be agreed upon by the consensus of its national union of delegates. Beyond this the rule of any town, village, or even homestead can vary greatly. The unifying factor of this union is to prevent the encroachment of the Alineados, of Centroamérica, of really anyone that would take a single step within their borders. If need be they will maintain the watch until the second coming, and they will be happy. The Patagonian Free Bioregion is in a somewhat similar situation and with a comparable disposition. The bioregion is ruled by the “General Affairs Ecological Commission” an organ whose entire purpose is to oversee the remediation and rehabilitation of the region and the preservation of biodiversity. Beyond this the bioregion has little in the way of government, though a kind of informal anarcho-syndicalism dominates based around the agglomeration of segments of the economy dedicated to the support of the commission. The Bioregion has little in the way of foreign relations outside of the International hence it is considered a peripheral state, though the GAEC does operate a communications line (by way of radio waves bounced off the ionosphere) with the Liaoyang Ecological Secretariat. SECOND AFRICAN UNION To call it the Second African Union is to imply that the first one ever ended, a stance which will earn you many an evil eye at the very best were you to say it in earshot of anyone living in the great lands between the two shores. It would also (arguably) be inaccurate depending on how you read the situation. While it is true that the All-Africa Parliament hasn’t met in generations, many of the local institutions and their regional branches such as the African CDC, AU Technical Boards, and Court of Justice (not counting the African Development Bank which has spun off on its own as an independent power) still exist and hold immense sway over the center of the continent. These states that recognize the authority and validity of the remaining inter-African institutions are thus often called the Second African Union. In terms of governmental philosophy there is also a general agreement between the African states. Most are very light regimes with distributist or mutualist economies. Many of them lean on ceremonial authority, with the position of head of state often being given to rotating lists of tribal, religious, and popular authorities (sometimes the pop in popular is more literal, many states have musicians as their heads of state) that often serve the purposes of acting as consultants for inter-state institutions. What really makes the SAU stand out though is a parallel system of social organization that is unique to it, one which while not involved in the direct governance of their countries is so ubiquitous that their kinds of states are named after them. A system known as the “matchmaker state”. A feature of SAU society is that of matchmaking, a socially prescribed system of arranged marriage for every person. Matchmaking began in part as a public health measure, instituted to combat high rates of consanguineous marriage, which threatened to rise during the collapse era. Matchmakers were originally public health professionals and statisticians that helped compile family records and advocate for or against different pairings, breaking apart what remained of the old brideprice system of organizing marriages along tribal lines. As the collapse accelerated these individuals were leaned upon more and became an institution of their own, supported by their superior officers and administrators within this redoubt of the African Union. This did not mean that uniformity was maintained in how matchmaking was done however, nor how matchmakers were chosen and invested with power. Various nations began to drift apart in how they enacted their programs, and by the 22nd century these have evolved into cultural and civilizational distinctions in their own right. A look at three of the most prestigious states within the Second African Union gives us a view of the diversity in modern day matchmaker regimes. The State of the Congo employs a more or less automated system by way of synthetic intelligence. From an early age Congolese citizens are given a robotic friend, often in the form of a ball droid that observes their personal and social development. At an indeterminate point in time, though usually as a citizen approaches adulthood, the droid through coordination with the nation wide collective synthetic consciousness, assigns them a mate based upon mutual compatibility and the benefits said marriage would bring to social cohesion (the latter takes precedence). Ages between pairings can vary, though most people are married off by the time they turn 20. At which point as part of the matchmaking ceremony the new couple destroy each other’s droids. The Fourth East African Republic employs a system of social matchmaking, wherein the whole community through an in-country social network, deliberates and marries off their siblings. Decisions are often made by way of majority assent, though it is possible to give one’s vote over to another person. This creates a culture where-in those who are believed to be the best matchmakers are given more and more authority to officiate and form couples by their “fans”, leading to the rise of “celebrity-matchmakers” several of whom have been made heads of state in recent history. The Inha-Zambe Mutual Association to round out the three examples instead uses a series of mutually reinforcing and interlocking matchmaking boards staffed by professionals institutionally descended from the old AU matchmakers. These boards look over statistical, biological, and social data personally and give suggestions. Suggestions can then be supported or blocked by other boards until a consensus is reached. This system is sometimes tongue in cheek called the “Ministry of Love” or the “Love Boards” by the people of the IZMA. LIBERTARIAN EXPERIMENTS How hard is for the G-man to just stay out of your business? The answer to that is very hard, it’s literally why they exist to shove so many self-serving laws down your throat until you choke and invoke some principle they made up last week to force you to sign some contract that gives them kickbacks for ‘letting’ you breathe another few minutes. Heaven forbid you give them so much as the stink eye in return or they’ll shoot your dog if they’re feeling particularly humanitarian that day. As it turns out though the government doesn’t want you to know that when Armageddon happens you can actually just turn your guns on the suits and send them packing if you’re quick on your feet! During the collapse this happened in more places than you’d think, and for a good long while not merely libertarianism but good old home-grown anarcho-capitalism finally got time to shine. It’s not hard to find libertarian realms, they’re scattered here and there, just take a trip out to the American interior away from the Ecumenes or maybe spend some time in former Bulgaria or West India one of these days. Most have moderated in recent years, becoming economically value neutral or otherwise laying the groundwork for the rise of a new ruling class, though leaving behind social norms that in the worst instances merely gave rise to new gentry republics and in the best cases resulting in states where you can often forget the government exists at all. Among the libertarian spring though there were two great powers that emerged that decided to try their hands at not just imagining a new society but really making it stick. Still standing today as lands of great note, they are the ReNoCo and the Ouestrian Agorapact. The ReNoCo or “Region of Non-Coercion” is a zone of control stretching across former Colombia and Venezuela. Based on the principles of non-coercion, personal sovereignty, and voluntary association, the ReNoCo are a people who view success and benevolence as the greatest heights of human society. Encouraging entrepreneurship and a productive economy the ReNoCo is a stateless society, polycentric in its distribution of authority with a vigorous market of arbitrators, and competition between firms vying for public support and cultivation of a loyal consumer base. A society of free credit, perhaps one of the only limitations that exists in ReNoCo society is a massive taboo against speculation and fictitious capital, which has actually served to prevent the development of monopolies. Like all capitalist societies the ReNoCo has seen the development of what is effectively a haute bourgeoisie, an unofficial nobility from among those families where generational wealth has been allowed to accumulate. However, owing to the social compunctions of the ReNoCo this “nobility” is also known for its noblesse oblige, believing that one of the great errors of old capitalism that caused it to degenerate was the transformation of the industrial and financial capitalist class from one that demonstrated their wealth to the masses into one that attempted to hide it and instead assert control. It is better to have a society where the rich wear elaborate costumes and act like ancien nobility but where the common man can still succeed than to have one where they dress like the common man and ruin the lives of millions with the flick of a wrist. This naturally has made the ReNoCo opposed to their technocratic neighbors to the north whom they view as the culmination of the old “crony capitalist” system. The Technocrats in turn view the ReNoCo as stupid. No deep incisive parrying of words for you there my reader. They just don’t like ‘em. The ReNoCo is also a deeply pluralistic society as is to be expected, attracting refugee populations from around the world, notably from Europe and Asia. They also contain the largest community of Jews in the world after the fall of Israel. The Ouestrian Agorapact is another story, though a fascinating one. This West African power was originally intended as an Agorist society, with the Ouestrians sharing a similar management infrastructure to the East Africans, that being a national social network used to organize society. However in the Agorapact this national intranet was used for the creation of a sort of governmental market. Policies would be voted on collectively, and parallel to this would exist a national betting market where voters could then bet on the efficaciousness of new laws or policies. Those that made correct bets would have their votes weighted more, and those that made incorrect bets would have their future votes weighted less. Thus the market would over time optimize direct democracy towards those with the best ability to make the best decisions for all of society. There was however a wrinkle in this plan. As it turns out one can augment the ability to make predictions with the proper infrastructure, which costs capital to get access to. This means that the actors that could make the best predictions were rarely individuals but companies, unions, churches, and social interest groups that could pool money. In a wild twist a “betting front” was formed between the Ouestrian churches and workers’ cooperatives (the latter allowed to operate under the ancap system due to there being no laws governing how people should organize their own businesses) that were able to in time obtain a supermajority of accessible voting power through social meta-engineering. Once this hegemony was established, they simply voted syndicalism into power, turning the libertarian state into a socialist powerhouse overnight. You could say they won in the marketplace (and betting pool) of ideas. MISCELLANEOUS STATES There are states worth mentioning that do not fall into the categories mentioned above, and we would be remiss to forget them. These powers tend not to fall into any of the previously mentioned groups or tendencies due to the particularity of their history but are still rather relevant. First among them would be the Confessional Gangeyarajya. If the first word tipped you off then you’re quick, yes it shares many similarities with Shiloh in how it is organized. That said, Gangeyarajya is confessional state less because it contains a diversity of religious societies but as a result of patronage by one dominant clade for another given their shared history. Gangeyarajya is the result of a Muslim uprising against the local Hindu nationalist security states that were established in the east of India during the collapse era as Bangladeshis fled into the country. Seizing control of swathes of the Eastern Gangetic Plain, the Confessionalists enacted a regime of Islamification and expulsion of the local population. The wheel turns as they say. During the conflict the Christian tribes and nationalities sided with their religious cousins (and often co-ethnics) and so as Gangeyarajya solidified its grip a carveout was made for the largely Baptist communities that now dominate the eastern expanse of the union. The Second Democratic Republic of Brazil (let’s just call it Brazil) is the result of what happens when you put a loaded gun in the hands of someone that (you don’t know) hates you. Completely fractured by the collapse, the south of Brazil was able to reorganize before the other regions under a clique of old school rentiers and finance capitalists that leveraged their private armies to establish a regime known as the Democratic Republic of Brazil. Based out of São Paulo the DRB managed to over time assert control over much of the country again. Hoping to solidify their regime and step away from managing it to enjoy lives of thoughtless luxury instead the new lords of Brazil embarked on one last program, the creation of a national Synthetic Intelligence that could crush dissent and run the country for them. When the SI “Jeremiah” was brought online to a room full of ecstatic would-be princes and nobles it was given the order to “eliminate Brazil’s enemies”. Taking mere moments to make sense of the order the SI determined with haste who Brazil’s enemies were, ordering the guard now under its command to rush into the room and execute everyone present. Declaring thereafter the Second Democratic Republic, Jeremiah now rules the land with wisdom and sagacity, at least as much as a glorified chatbot can which it turns out is a lot more than most people. The Hasanids are the remnants of a once great state that stretched from Anatolia to Mecca. As the DemFed came undone the municipal structure it left behind was seized to form the basis of a new “pure Islamic democratic society”. A people’s caliphate based around a constituent assembly of municipalities, the Hasanids would get their name not from what they called themselves but as a kind of retronym applied by their successors after their greatest leader. It was the Hasanids who would finish what the Three Flags started, emerging victorious in the multi-generational siege of Israel and at last seizing all of the Levant under the black flag. It was considered an age of heroes, and the capstone marking for some (though they did not say it aloud) the death of the old and the beginning of the end of the world. The world though is still here, and the Hasanid Caliphate is not any longer. The modern day Hasanids are not those men of days long gone, they don’t even hold Mecca or Istanbul as they once did. What remains instead are smaller petty states, kingdoms, and assemblies all claiming descent from that era. That said the Hasanids are not pushovers and even the Krasnodar Agreement has accepted that they will hold on for the foreseeable future. In a fun twist, by the beginning of the 23rd century the assemblies of the Levant and Mesopotamia will unite into a new Islamic Confederation and join the Krasnodar states. That will cause some heads to turn when it happens. CONCLUSION The new year approaches, 2174 is on everyone’s lips. Bio-forges hum, growing organs and parts for biocompatible prosthetics. A man unlocks the door to his commune’s groundfridge, his wrist computer runs calculations to determine the optimal allotment of food after this year’s harvest. A hole is blown into a cliff-face to make space for a modular nuclear reactor as onlookers with filter masks hold parasols in the midday sun. Artificial micro islands bob up and down, each a tiny biome in their own right, surveyed by a scout gliding above on a variable sky sail. In a lighthouse a wealthy man toasts his guests, blessing his ancestors for buying the building a century and a half ago for nothing. For in a world where the heavens are once more off-limits ships and their sailors need them more than ever. Mycelium sheets are shaped with a hand press into boxes to be sold at the marketplace next morning. A woman slowly fashions a bench out of cob, her droid rolls by and bumps into it leaving a mark. She laughs. In a grassy field somewhere a couple are resting. Lying on the ground their fingers intertwine as they look up at the sky. White blimps hang overhead, slowly descending from among the clouds. Out of them pours a glittering mass dispersing across the land like mana from heaven. As they touch down their shape becomes clear, that of men with jetpacks not spewing flame but the hazy crackle of hot air as if wafting off a lake in summer. Their armor of cloth and silk and sinewy fiber catches up in the air and makes them look like rainbow strokes against a canvas. Their feet rest so gently that they barely disturb the grass underneath, leaving behind but a near imperceptible singe beneath them. They walk now with purpose, swords over their shoulders, their other hands resting with confidence on the rifles slung across their chests. The Knights have arrived.\\" Can you describe the political, social, cultural, and economic situation of this setting?","output":"The setting described is an elaborate and detailed speculative fiction scenario set in the year 2173, following a period known as the Collapse Era, which was characterized by geopolitical upheaval, climate disasters, and societal breakdown. This setting is futuristic and combines elements of solarpunk—a utopian vision focused on sustainable energy and harmony with nature—with post-apocalyptic and cyberpunk themes. The portrayal of society is nuanced, blending high technology with traditional and communal ways of life. Here is a breakdown of key aspects of this setting: Political Situation: - It is a period of fragmented polities and neo-feudal structures, with small states and great empires coexisting. Global institutions and universalist notions of citizenship have largely disappeared, replaced by localized forms of governance that are more conservative and community-oriented. - The major political powers are not traditional nation-states but rather superpowers or \\"orders\\" evolved from multinational charities and development banks that survived the collapse. - Notable powers include 12 (technically 13) superpowers whose influence is grounded in their knightly orders and control of swathes of non-contiguous land. - The region that once consisted of North America is now home to Ecumenical Societies, religious-oriented states, alongside some secular enclaves and the remnants of previous governments. - The Sinitic meta-civilization in East Asia has developed into self-governing and culturally cohesive but politically disparate states, all espousing some form of socialism or communism. - In the Caribbean and regions of South America, technocratic states have emerged, distinguished by wealth accumulation and a banking-centric approach. - The Krasnodar Agreement encapsulates the successor states of the Democratic Federation, a collective of Eurasian territories with diverse governance structures but bound by agreements. Social and Cultural Situation: - This world has witnessed dramatic demographic shifts, and the resulting communities have entrenched social policing, strong conservation of norms, and a rejection of previous globalized cultural concepts. - Religiosity is prevalent, with faith playing a significant role in the identity and governance of many societies, leading to the emergence of \\"New Believers\\" who convert for social or practical reasons. - Knightly orders have captured the cultural imagination, being the embodiments of military prowess and loyalty, symbolic of broader social values and expectations. - There is a cultural diversity ranging from strong traditionalism in some regions to post-queerness in others, where previously marginalized identities have been integrated into local cultures in different ways. Economic Situation: - The economy is diverse, with regions adopting varying economic models based on their cultural and social norms. There is an emphasis on permaculture, sustainable production, and locally rooted economies. - Advanced technology enables a blend of traditional craftsmanship with futuristic biotech and other technologies, leading to a solarpunk aesthetic and functionality in many societies. - Some areas, notably in Africa and regions subscribing to libertarian philosophies, have developed unique economic arrangements like betting-weighted democracy or voluntary association to direct economic activity. In summary, this speculative setting suggests a highly complex tapestry of communities that have emerged from global turmoil. It has eschewed the centralized and uniform systems of governance and culture that defined the pre-collapse world, instead fostering a multiplicity of localized and specialized social, cultural, and political experiments geared towards sustainability, identity, and belief systems. This world juxtaposes traditional community values with advanced technologies, leading to a dynamic fusion of past, present, and future."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The galaxy's inhabitants exhibit a remarkable range of physical appearances, reflecting the diverse racial makeup that has evolved across different systems. Caucasians are represented with their varying skin tones, hair colors, and facial features, while Asians are depicted with their unique eye shapes, and Africans showcase the beautiful diversity of skin tones and facial structures found within their race. A significant presence in this galaxy are the rival factions of Nazis and Soviets, who play crucial roles in the novel's narrative. Nazis, known for their distinctive uniforms and symbolism, would represent a faction whose ideology is morally objectionable, seeking to impose their supremacist beliefs on others. Soviets, on the other hand, embody a different political ideology, representing a rival force with contrasting principles. Amidst these races and factions, a persecuted and protected race called Jews emerges as an integral part of the galaxy's identity. The Jews are depicted as a resilient community, deeply rooted in their cultural heritage. They face constant threats from the antagonist groups, such as the Nazis, who aim to eradicate or oppress them due to their religious and ethnic background. In this galaxy, the intermingling and conflicts between these diverse races and factions become the driving force of the narrative. The struggles, alliances, and tensions that arise from this diversity serve as a backdrop for exploring themes of identity, morality, and the impact of divisive ideologies within societies. \\"Naziology\\" delves into the complexities and consequences of such racial and ideological diversity, offering readers an opportunity to ponder the significance of these elements and their impact on the galaxy's inhabitants."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

All about are the sounds of commotion. Trains glide across crystal waters kicking up mist as robots roll between adobe houses and under splaying canopies and a broken sky. Turbine balloons float tethered above village communes as mechanics and whizz kids fiddle with prosthetics, tracing their hands across each mechanism’s flowery reliefs. Refugees are shepherded beyond the great deserts that now swallow up much of the world, and in art nouveau palaces knights and reiters swear fealty to their handlers. Welcome back to the world of tomorrow stranger, though it’s a bit different than how you remember. The year is 2173 AD. Almost a century and a half has passed since the Collapse Era began, though the exact time when it ended is in dispute, not that there’s any global institution that could decide when that was anymore. While the “Collapse Era” is a broad term, beginning before the climate collapse itself kicked off in earnest, most historians set its beginning to the onset of the American War, a multi-generational conflict that engulfed the former United States and Canada between a panoply of pretender governments and post-American states of various kinds. The premature death of the world hegemon led to a discordant global period in which the major global institutions attempted to reorient themselves under the UN now based (mainly) out of Vienna. The new order was, in its own words, imperfect and reactive. The need to shore up faith in the global system, to ensure the protection of accounts, states, and economies reeling in the face of America’s fall, and the pressure to balance the now more pronounced regional frameworks in Europe, Africa, and even the Caribbean meant that the post-American world was dominated more by an attempt to loot the great behemoth as it tore itself apart in order to keep itself going for as long as possible as opposed to creating anything enduring. In the midst of this other parts of the world began to pull apart at the edges. In the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia the Three Flags Army otherwise known as the Democratic Federation, tore through the region, even taking Mecca for a brief period of time. The outpouring of American refugees (which themselves presaged the larger refugee waves of the era) became a source of conflict as many nations especially in the global south fought over access to a new very skilled and cheap workforce that was up for grabs. China and peripheral nations jumped at the opportunity that had been presented and attempted to kitbash a Fifth Internationale, leading to a breakdown in relations with its former European partners, themselves attempting to recreate the once expansive American intelligence system by importing former members of the US Deep State into their new federal military framework. Meanwhile the war itself quickly broke out of containment, spreading outside the United States and requiring first the largest UN military mission in history, and later on the transformation of what remained of NATO into an occupying organ, seizing control of Canada to maintain stability only to find itself at war with its own people. Then at last the climate collapse itself hit in earnest. Alongside this, economic pressures from the declining energy returns on fossil fuels compounded the costs states were taking on, and uneven population growth and demographic shifts obliterated long standing institutions in developed nations and undercut nascent regimes across the rest of the globe. World powers became more desperate and reckless, escalating to the point of bringing Kessler Syndrome down upon everyone to deny other nations vital infrastructure and going beyond that to even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on their enemies and rebellious populations. The more humanity held on and the harder its grip became the more the future slipped out of its fingers until it was all gone. Once again the year is 2173, the world population stands at just under 6.5 billion. A century or so is enough time to heal most wounds, provided one actually wants to do the healing. A casual observer or tourist to this world might be struck by how pleasant much of it looks. A view of the late 22nd century evinces a sense of a world painted in watercolor, something ripped out of a solarpunk moodboard or a Chobani commercial. Aesthetically and technologically speaking this is most certainly the case. It is a world of colorful adobe houses and limewashed buildings, of floating turbines, airwells, solar furnaces and pedal powered machines. A time of bionic and folk-craft motifs and stained glass opening up into rooms of optical computers and bio-forges. Of bacteria-phages and gmo molds and mushrooms breaking down the remnants of the old plasticene. Of consciously designed permaculture landscapes around communes on one end and flowing linear arcologies on the other. Socially though? Politically? That’s a different story. The 22nd century is not a time of hand-holding, of positive psychology, utopian cosmopolitanism or down to earth anarchistic sentimentality. It is in many ways a return to form, a world emerging orthogonal from the past and its expectant future and containing bits of both on its own terms. It is a time of small states yet great empires, conservative communities, knightly orders and guild wars, at once an abandonment and refutation of the liberal and secular notions of the old globalized world in some cases and an attempt to race past them altogether in others. A time of close knit families and communes and bloody conflicts wiping out entire lands. Above all though it is a world that has abandoned the once popular maxim that “men are simply born for no reason”. For in the 22nd century all men have an end that they know, be it prescribed by their state, their community, their liege, their party, or their God. When the collapse came it was primarily those great global institutions and the social sentiments that had emerged alongside them which fared the worst. The United Nations, the internet, the global economy and so on, yes even air traffic control, all were dashed against the rocks. While states would return, communities would persist and dig deep roots, the idea of the liberal citizen, of the neutral state, of institutions that exist solely for the purpose of their own survival that would not. Those that survived the collapse and came to seize the 22nd century were those that were able to orient their societies towards specific ends, either that of a destined future or of building a kind of humanity and social order within their borders. The closest equivalent we might have is that of a “theocracy” though this is not entirely accurate. While many 22nd century states are oriented towards a kind of religious end or according to a specific cosmology, just as many are not, and many “secular” orders of the 22nd century (such a term being outmoded) in fact evolved out of the practical administrative structures of 21st century religious movements. Things are never quite so straightforward. The 22nd century itself is not even dominated by great powers in the way we would understand the word. For while one might look at a map and see a collection of states which contest land and people, the real powers of the era are different. As stated previously, the major multinational institutions and broader global framework of the 21st century did not survive, but there were some hangers on of the complex globalized society of the past that were able to maintain control and entrench themselves as modern superpowers by the 22nd century. These would turn out to be the descendants of the major charities and development banks, who having their own land, property, and people scattered across the world weathered the collapse and only became more powerful as the new order established itself. THE SUPERPOWERS AND KNIGHTS There are currently 12 (technically 13) superpowers or “orders” which dominate the world. They are the Society of Saint Joseph, Red Cross and Crescent, UNICEF, United Way, the Sravasti Viharas, Hare Khrishna, World Food Bank, Salvation Army, Nahdlatul Ulama, Tzu Chi Foundation, and both the African and Islamic Development Banks. The 13th will not be mentioned until later. With the exception of Saint Joseph which is based out of the Vatican (and formally a subordinate organ of the Catholic Church), none of the superpowers have any “home turf” as it were, instead contesting large swaths of non-contiguous land across the planet. There is not a single part of the world that does not see the presence of at least one of these powers. The origin of many of these powers is rather clear, though others are more particular. The Sravasti Viharas for instance are the descendants of a Western Tibetan Buddhist abbey turned Humanistic foundation which attained global prominence due to its interlinking with the similarly minded Fo Guang Shan of the Taiwanese diaspora in the middle 21st century. Others are the amalgamation of many groups over time, such as the Society of Saint Joseph which was formed as a result of a papal decree merging the church’s major foundations together under a new organization. The development banks are the “odd man out” in this regard, though their rise and persistence is for similar reasons, due to the massive amount of sway and resources that fell under such institutions’ control as the global south themselves attempted and failed to beat back the collapse. These development banks would find themselves being transformed from multilateral institutions to the caretakers of their former patrons, and so emerged from the collapse in a position of prominence. What one most often thinks of when the global superpowers come to mind however is not the land they contest nor their immense amount of wealth and vassals, but their knightly orders. Professional standing armies were one of the institutions that did not survive the 21st century in most parts of the world and are now the exception rather than the rule. While many states now have the potential to field standing armies again most do not due to institutional pressures against doing so that have become entrenched. Frankly speaking, most states view anything beyond a militia or at most a gendarmerie, to be a waste of time and resources. The superpowers are the notable exception to this, having the resources, funding, manpower, and reason to field large numbers of men at their command. The nature of warfare has changed however, and so have the kinds of men who fight. A big reason for this is technological developments in the past century and a half. In this world of bionics and organic technology one of the great shifts that would occur would be the (with caveats) victory of personal defense and armor over firearms. A great innovation of the modern era, organically grown heat regulating kinetic hardening foam has allowed for the creation of coats and breeches and other wearables that can deflect rounds with ease. Prohibitively expensive to be sure, but not impossible for the superpowers who have of course also locked down the process for creating them. Production costs limit the number of people that can be outfitted even by the wealthiest and most powerful bodies on Earth however. As such the superpowers rely on and use them to outfit small-ish professional corps of loyal soldiers, sworn to them for more or less life, to fight on their behalf. These form the basis of the modern knightly orders. Your average knight for the global superpowers then is exactly that, a man wearing effectively bulletproof quilted armor, often in layers starting with long undershirts and ending generally in either a large greatcoat or medium length jacket with roomy elbow length sleeves. Attached to the front (or sometimes the back) of their person is a bio-mechanical “third arm” folded against their body with an integrated weapon meant flip out and blow off exposed body parts should they be revealed during close combat. Close combat is in fact the name of the game, for although it is true that organic armor is effective against firearms, that simply inspired men to find new ways around them. The monomolecular sword would be this workaround, solving the issue of organic foam armor by simply slicing through it. A quirk of such weapons however is that due to the van der walls force a clean swipe will immediately seal right up, so sword combat between knights is based around hacking and slashing their enemy apart, and if possible blowing them apart with one’s prosthetic third arm should an opening arise. Large numbers of ordinary troops provide support and often operate drones and anti-drone weapons on the battlefield. As one can guess this means that knights require a lot of training, which makes them all the more of an investment that superpowers are desperate to hang onto. In many ways the knightly orders are an attempt to accommodate this, to give their fighting men not merely money but prestige and a kind of life and status that separates them from the hoi polloi. Knights are given great freedom in how they live their lives, access to land, and special exceptions to sumptuary laws. Knights are in many ways encouraged to take pride not merely in their work but in the symbols of it. This often takes the form of employing designers to create elaborate and specialized patterns and motifs on the outer layers of their armor and sometimes the insides of the coats and jackets too. There is no need to hide oneself after all, one might as well show off. Even calling them knights is intentional in this respect. Knights operate in fireteams or “lances” (equivalent to a squad of 8 or 10 men) headed by an operator. An “operator” is both a lance-leader and an intermediary, denoted by their special implants. Operators have two implants, one in their skull and one in their jaw, the former which turns thoughts into transmittable information, and the latter which picks up transmissions and uses bone conduction to allow it to be heard as if it were a human voice. Operators are paired to “handlers” who have matching implants. Handlers are stationed outside of the battlefield, often with other handers at one of their superpower’s local command stations, where through the use of drones, aerostats, and access to local infrastructure they have full view of the battlefield. Handlers and operators coordinate in battle and often develop a peculiar rapport with each other due to having access to each other’s thoughts on and off the battlefield. Despite the attempts by the superpowers to keep a lock on their knights it is not unheard of for some to go rogue, or in the case where a superpower loses a region to another for knights of the losing side to use the opportunity to move into freelancing for local states. There are some benefits to going from being one knight among many to being the only one or two of your kind that a county or even small nation leans on. THE AMERICAN ECUMENES Despite the previous statement that “theocracy” does not mean theocracy, the first states to be covered will be the American theodemocracies. Ultimately none of the contenders of the American War survived into the modern era, with the notable exception of a redoubt of the old Sacramento Government clinging on in Cascadia. Instead, it would be social clubs and faith communities that would persist as the national and later regional governments crumbled, forming the basis of a new post-American society. The “Ecumenical Societies” are a result of this, nations which privilege the church, mosque, temple and so on as the fundamental unit of civil society and government. Likewise, the national mythos of these states draw both from the collapse era experience and the religious traditions of their peoples, with most states being named after places in scripture, which can be a somewhat confusing prospect when someone says “the Land of Galilee” and they mean the region around Lake Winnipeg. Together the Ecumenical Conference of North America stretches across much of former North America, excluding the great desert of course. Among the conference though there are eight Ecumenes which are the most prominent, and which are most likely to be referenced when one talks about North America. First there is the Land of Gilead, based out of the former Northeast Atlantic. Gilead is perhaps the closest to an old fashioned party-state and indeed its constitution even references the communists and Lenin in particular (alongside the old fascist jurist Schmitt) as their ideological forebears. To Gilead all governments instituted by men are dictatorships in the name of a particular interest, with old world democracies themselves being bourgeois dictatorships. Similarly, civil society is a sorting system by which dictatorship is established, friends and enemies are designated, and the basis upon which the dictatorship distributes rewards and punishments is rationalized. Gilead is unique in that while being dominated by Catholics (with a significant folk element by way of its absorption of former Baptists and Methodists from the Appalachia area), it accedes to the old Communist maxim that a Communist party, in representing the interests of the proletariat and peasantry, is by its nature democratic because it makes as its main interest the majority of the population. This is one of the reasons why the ruling party, the Party for Solidarity and Virtue, modeled itself off of them. Where it diverges however is that to the people of Gilead the main question of governance is not who is ruled but who is sovereign. To the Gilead Party by instead attributing their primary interest to the ultimate sovereign: God, as opposed to the ultimate subject: Humanity, their regime has fixed the errs of previous capitalist and communist empires. The mentality of the people of Gilead can be summed up with the line “the previous exercise of government concerned itself with the question of what man says man is and of what interest is man to himself. We concern ourselves however with what God says man is and of what interest man is to God.” In terms of governance Gilead has been very successful, maintaining one of the more prosperous realms on the continent. This is helped by their monopoly on hydropower, not just the Niagara Falls Dam, but their recently successful megaproject of damming the James Bay as well. South of Gilead is the Land of Bethel. A unique specimen among Post-American states, the people of Bethel trace their roots in large part to the work of the Collapse Era “Community Welfare Alliance” or “CWAA” and smaller episcopal and progressive church cliques in the region. Heavily leaned on for the restoration of order and civil society during the Boston Government’s short time holding the Atlantic Coast, the “chapter houses” that they established would seize control of the state apparatus during the pretender state’s eventual retreat from the area. Modern day Bethel is a great example of what is meant when 22nd century states are called “conservative”, that is to say they focus heavily on the maintenance of social order and continuity of norms across generations. Communities in the 22nd century from the local to national level engage in high levels of social policing, which says nothing to what the norms of said society are. Bethel on this front is known particularly for its only national level organ the “Bureau for the Prevention of Vice”, under which their national gendarmerie, descended from the old CWAA, is organized. Bethel is also an example of what are sometimes referred to as “post-queer” societies, which is to say societies which had normalized certain social relations for sexual and gender minorities prior to the Collapse Era or which otherwise had influential cliques representing their interests which were maintained into the 22nd century. Post-Queer societies are quite common, more a reflection of the collapse of a social movement globally (due to the collapse of the world in general) not necessitating a reversal of social changes in specific regions, but instead attempts to reorient them within the new baseline of a much “smaller” and more parochial world, mostly through the mimicry of or full integration into the new regimes of social policing performed by the rest of society. Bethel for instance is well known for its program of free at point of use hormonal therapy for gender minorities and streamlined system to accommodate Self Identification, alongside having the death penalty for distribution of pornography of any kind. These two positions are considered to naturally exist hand-in-hand in Bethel society, and locals would be confused were one to attempt to argue with them that these are not positions one needs to hold to maintain social harmony and personal flourishing. Further south is the Land of Goshen. A descendant of the once great Internationalist Commune of Dixie, the people of Goshen still use a modified version of their ancestors’ flag. The system of municipal communes and horse-trading which dominated Dixie politics and their erstwhile congress would eventually form the basis of the current system of elector councils. Goshen in large part is dominated by the “Southron Church”, formally an ecumenical board jointly held by the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African National Baptist Convention, which rose in prominence with the spinning apart of the once dominant Southern Baptist Convention. Goshen is made up of elector districts, which are headed by either secular or religious councils depending on if the local voting authority is centered around the town hall or church board. The elector districts select members for the congress which is the supreme authority of the land. Elector councils often band together into larger administrative federations where they coordinate and draft fiscal policy and direct the operation of infrastructure manned by cooperatives or other socially owned enterprises that contain members from their respective districts. In some cases this manifests as unofficial “party” blocs, often along the lines of the old school commune era divisions of agrarians, romantics, and communists though as a formally non-partisan state they are not called such. Secular and religious electors are generally equal in number, but due to the near unanimous allegiance of religious electors to the Southron Church (and the semi-formalized process of the church sending notices of whom they want their electors to send to congress) the nation is in dominated by the church. Goshen, however, is also noteworthy for its parallel systems of law enforcement, with both a national militia (descended from the Southern People’s Liberation Army) and a “knightly board”. Goshen prefers to leverage the services of independent knights and reiters, formerly sworn to the superpowers, for mediating disputes between councils and counties. This is a very attractive offer, especially for older knights who wish to enter a kind of “retirement”. Goshen’s independent knights often hail from UNICEF or the United Way due to the region being further away from their zones of control and firmly held under the Red Cross. Speaking of crosses, Goshen is famous for its yearly Victory Day celebrations which commemorate the triumph of the old Dixie armies over the Black Cross in the American War. Celebrations typically consist of work battalions, dressed up in Collapse Era uniforms, dragging replica Black Cross flags through the mud, culminating in their public burning. Victory Day is also noteworthy for the flying of flags of those nations and foreign militias that aided Dixie in the conflict. As those states no longer exist today, a Goshen town or city on Victory Day is one of the last places on Earth one might see many 21st century flags still flown. Back north one of the descendants of Old Exurbia, now known as the Land of Canaan, can be found. Still based around its old quasi-capital of Tecumseh (former Columbus). The history of Canaan is just as off kilter and curious as its predecessor. The Exurbians had always been a peculiar deviation away from the communalists they were inspired by, attempting a far more “pure” framework trending towards generalized anarchy alongside a kind of American cultural revolution. A people carried aloft as much by an affinity for witchcraft and new age syncretism as they were by their grungecore “i’m playing a riotgrrrl track in a blasted out shopping mall” war of extermination against fascism. As such it is only fitting that it met an equally punk end. Which is to say that one day the men came home from the frontier, turned their guns on everyone and declared they would be doing full anarchism now. All in all it’s been pretty successful actually. Canaan has maintained, for roughly 80 years now, more or less a vacuity of any form of government outside of the People’s Guard. Beyond that, among the other Ecumenes it is also noted for its relative lack of any hard religious structures. The “Hexurbian” witches of the olden days gave way to a kind of neo-neo-pentecostal campbellism, where much like everything else the existence of discrete denominations was dismantled by force. A form of highly charismatic primitive Christianity dominates in this area, influencing the social norms and sensibilities of the people, even those unaffiliated among them. In terms of foreign relations everything is carried out by the People’s Guard which maintains a rotating roster of diplomatic posts for its officers. Despite not being able to predict who you’re talking to when conducting relations with the Canaanites the neighboring states have maintained long lasing positive relations with the anti-state, in part a continuation of the unofficial détente that existed between Exurbia and the pretender governments from back in the Hayes era. Speaking of Hayes and the Chicago Government, while that particular pretender no longer exists, Chicago itself is a major power in the new North America. Influenced by the region’s overlapping periods of control under the Chicago Government, the Quasi-Islamic National Rejuvenation Government, and the Sabaothic Host of the Prophetess Daniela and her followers, what emerged from the wake of the collapse era was the Land of Shiloh. An experiment in confessionalism, Shiloh’s government reflects the diversity of its population. A form of power-sharing is the name of the game, with the Shiloh constitution having built in administrative carveouts for Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, Muslims, Unitarians, Sabaothists, and the Baha’is. Although Shiloh is a state dominated by the public interchange of and horse-trading between different religious communities, above all of them exists a sort of public quasi-cult dedicated to the image and mission of the former United States. This is in large part due to the significant influence that various pretender governments, from Chicago, to the PNRG, to the South Dakota state government of the old 130th Division, played in laying the groundwork for its founding. President Hayes in particular is considered a folk hero of immense renown, for both preventing the fall of the region to fascism and stopping a potential nuclear exchange in the 2040s that would have devastated the continent. A somewhat amusing cultural divergence in this region, though often unremarked upon, was the effect that the ration-passport system of the Chicago Government played in shaping demographics. The Hayes era system (and its carry-ons during the later collapse) unintentionally encouraged diverse cohabitation of houses and compounds and what were known as “breadline marriages” in order to maximize access to goods and dispenser regions through the ration system. In effect everyone sharing a house or living on a street became a “family”. Across the Midwest it becomes difficult to trace ancestry back beyond the 2030s. A person’s last name thus might be Mattox because their “ancestors” all lived in the same building on Mattox street a century and a half ago. A similar expression of this phenomena can also be found in the region once known as Colorado, though to a more muted degree. Among the former states of the Texan led provisional government now stands the Land of Samaria. Samaria is descended from the “ProvGov” as it was called, more specifically from a special agreement between the Texan and Mexican security and intelligence services that during the later collapse period formed the basis of a multinational program to respond to the regional collapse, desertification and devastation of the gulf coast, and ensuing refugee waves, a program that would survive both nations. The formal dissolution of the remaining American pretender government in Austin would come shortly after its last motion, to begin the movement of millions of people from Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Mexico to the region now known as Samaria. After everything America might die but her people would survive if the Texans had anything to say about it. The Promised Land of the Texan and Louisianan pinewoods and oak cut prairies would prove to be the perfect place to begin again, and in time even the abandoned cities of Dallas and Fort Worth would be repopulated and reforged to serve as the current capitol of Samaria. Surprisingly retaining many of the institutions of the collapse era, Samaria is a federal republic with a presidency and a unicameral congress, though operating under a church-county system similar to neighboring Goshen. The success of the resettlement program gave the people of Samaria a sense of good government and the belief that a state properly staffed by the competent (and most importantly the virtuous) will always prevail. This means that the Samaritan government tends to be staffed by competent and well oriented people promoted not due to personal ambition or typical mechanistic meritocratic means, but by being forced into ever higher positions of responsibility by the ever watchful community, often beginning with the chittering of elderly women at the front rows of one’s church or the murmuring of men at the local social club. As they like to say, no good Samaritan goes unpunished. This has also led to the phenomenon in Samaria known as “Republican Nobility”, a kind of informal class position among the administrative upper crust of the state (and their immediate family) who due to the popular belief that their position was a result of their moral character are simply treated far better by all of society and are often encouraged to flaunt their status. A man who is rich because he owns property is considered an accident of history in Samarian culture and has no right to boast, whereas one who has served the people faithfully is believed to deserve to be rich and often made so. Far up north around Lake Winnipeg is the Land of Galilee. Along with its sisterland of Sidon to the west, Galilee is of importance less for any particular difference in its government, but due to its ruling myth and recent history. Like most of the ecumenical states in former Canada its origins can be traced back to the fall of the NATO regime in the country, and in the case of Galilee the beginning of it as well. Galilee stands at the crossroads of many mystical events in the recent history of the continent, having been the site of the Prophetess Daniela’s invasion of Canada which sparked the occupation in the first place. Galilee, like most Canadian states is known for a sizeable though not majority Sabaothic population, the religion having experienced a boost in the region after the fall of the faith’s own personal Babylon. What Galilee is more often known for however is the story of Terrance and the Miraculous Blade. In the latter half of the 21st century as the NATO regime and its local RCMP proxies increased in the intensity of their barbarism against the Canadian people, crackdowns would begin on all public gatherings in an attempt to break up hostile cells. Terrance Gauthier (otherwise known as St. Terrance) was a lay preacher, one of the many kinds of “wildflower” spokesmen that emerged at the time as an act of defiance following NATO’s retreat from Alberta. The wildflowers were a broad classification of dissident, including everything from religious preachers, to communists, to people who supported the return of democracy, to simply anyone the military government didn’t like. It is unknown if Terrance was originally a religious wildflower, but he eventually became one, leading to the local RCMP detachment to believe he was involved in or otherwise knew about the location of several dissident cells. He was not and did not. Repeated failures to make any headway by surveilling Terrance caused his observers to become frustrated and spiteful, changing plans first to assaulting Terrance to get information out of him to eventually simply looking for an excuse to kill him outright. Everything from having his house seized to his church closed down and fellow parishioners arrested did not bring Terrance to violence. Finally, an attempt to encourage him to assault an officer by pulling him into the middle of the road and beating him backfired and resulted in him running away, leading to the Mounties chasing after him and shooting him in the leg. As Terrance began to bleed out in the middle of a clearing the Mounties surrounded him with their weapons raised. Terrance raised his hand into the air, which one interpreted as him having finally broken and offering to give him whatever information they believed he might have. Instead, Terrance told them that he would show them a miracle. Looking up to the sky he said: “Lord, not that I might gain, or bargain for my life with your power, but that they who persecute me might be saved. That if you will that they might know you by my faith. For you are the author of life, and if it be your will then this air though it remain in sight and touch air will be in truth a blade that should I grab it would cut my hand.” Terrance would grasp the air above his head. His palm would be sliced open and start to bleed. The Mounties would panic and shoot him seven times. The final collapse of Canada would mean Terrance would have the last laugh, and indeed the story goes that at least a couple of those who witnessed the event would later switch sides, with their testimonies being why the story was popularized in the first place. So, he arguably obtained all his goals. He’s considered the national hero of modern-day Galilee and the saint-of-the-nation by the region’s Catholic and Lutheran believers. Finally there is the Land of Sidon. A recent arrival in the history of Post-American states, it is of great renown due to its ongoing rivalry with neighboring Cascadia. Formally “The United States of America”, Cascadia is what remains of the once great Sacramento Government and its ruling body COMPOR. Based around the former military regime in PNW and the Seattle Green Zone, the remnant state has succeeded in solidifying its rule, due to celebrate the 400th year anniversary of the USA soon! A unitary government despite the name, Cascadia can be best described as a “cop-ocracy” in service to the cartels and corporations which dominated the old government, now reforged into what are effectively a kind of ancien nobility, an anachronism wrapped in another anachronism. Sidon is dedicated to the destruction of what remains of the USA, or what it perceives to be a mockery of the world that was lost during the collapse. The cold war between Sidon and Cascadia is playing out primarily in the city of Vancouver, which remains for now outside the reach of either power. A cat and mouse game is afoot between both sides, constantly attempting to outmaneuver and undo the other’s inroads into the free city, which all sides know will fall to one side eventually. Among the ecumenes of North America a phenomenon has emerged in recent years, that of the “New Believers”, those individuals who come from secular or explicitly atheist families going back 3 or more generations that have at least outwardly converted to a local religion following the rise of the new system. To be clear there were seismic shifts and trends in religiosity in America during the collapse era, though a sizeable chunk of the population remained otherwise stable in previously held secularity as is to be expected, operating as normal under the new system as it gelled. However, trends have been noticed in recent years, especially by those who collect the stats, of segments of the population that did not shift over the past century, but which have now experienced seemingly spontaneous changes in outward religiosity after the new order became entrenched, often corresponding to areas or among those institutions where doing so would be more beneficial. The rise of New Believers is more pronounced in Shiloh for instance with its confessional appointment system, than in Goshen where there is a whole parallel secular state. In recent years these New Believers have experienced a degree of mistrust and wariness accorded to them by some segments of the population, though this has yet to escalate beyond the level of a kind of cultural background radiation. As a result it is not unheard of for New Believers to find themselves needing to express an even more intense religiosity and loyalty to compensate or otherwise “prove” themselves to their detractors. Outside of the ecumenes and Cascadia there is not much to note about the rest of the continent with two exceptions. The first is the Heartland Commonwealth, a state stretching from former Utah to Kansas which considers itself the legal and spiritual successor to the Chicago Government, though having dropped the pretenses of being the sole American state. Known for their massive solar powered fixed wing transport planes that lazily circuit the whole perimeter of their nation and the pilotless caravans that move across the plains, the Heartlanders are in an almost romantic recreation of an American ideal interested in little more than friendly neighbors and profitable trade. There is also the San Fran Commune, an quasi-outpost of the Seventh International on American shores. They, however, will have to be touched on later. THE SINITIC META-CIVILIZATION As it turns out the fall of the People’s Republic during the collapse was not enough to get communism out of the blood of the Chinese people. As any visitor to the far east will tell you, that particular quirk is here to stay. Today every Chinese state is officially some form of communist or socialist, and all claim to be the (or at least a) successor to the People’s Republic. There is, amusingly, a legal continuity of government regime of the old PRC still operating in Taiwan, and the ruling party of the island is on paper at least well within its rights to claim that it is the CPC, but to be frank nobody really cares. The 30 states of the Chinese people represent their own kind of world, all viewing each other as reflections of the same shared legacy of “Chinese Civilizational Socialism”, though descended from different institutions, organs, and movements of the old empire that once dominated the land. The Third People’s Republic, based out of its capital of Xiong’an, is a unitary state that emerged out of a collapse era stewardship program established by China’s major state enterprises. Headed by the Continuing Committee, a descendant of the CPC Central Committee now staffed primarily by technical specialists and a consultative simulated intelligence that runs the economy, the TPR is often described as a kind of “People’s Technocracy”. Despite its heavily centralized state apparatus and potential to leverage immense amounts of power domestically, the TPR prefers to leave its people alone, operating under the belief that the continuing committee should only exist as a caretaker administration for a society that no longer needs to be ruled. To this end it has sought to make its regime at once flexible and ever present while also unobtrusive and has just recently abolished all taxation within its borders. The TPR is also known for its romanticism of early collapse era China, which it sees as the height of Chinese civilization both in terms of reach and cultural attainment. The TPR maintains a great deal of influence to its north, in the lands of former Mongolia and Siberian Russia, where Chinese settler states dominate. South of the TPR is the realm known as the Prefectural Confederation. Best described as an anarcho-syndicalist state, the Confederation is composed of a number of arcology communes and organizing committees composed of trade union representatives. This arrangement was the result of two main factors, first was the resettlement of large chunks of the coastal population to new inland linear arcologies as the sea level rose, and the second was what were known as the “two card reforms”. An attempt in the 21st century to transition away from reliance on enterprise unions, the ACFTU embarked on a program of expanding trade union participation by forming local sector unions to exist alongside enterprise-wide unions. These were known as the “two card reforms” due to the long period when many Chinese workers would be a part of two separate unions in the same work place and thus had two union cards. The success of the reforms was mixed, but it took hold deep in Jiangsu and Shandong where climate change would actually accelerate the transition in workplace structures as people had to physically move and restart their lives in the new linear arcologies. With the fall of the PRC the local workplace committees would strike, coopting the administrative structure given to them and organizing the network of arcologies along the lines of a dual communal congress and trade union senate structure. Today the Prefectural Confederation is seen as a kind of intermediate zone, largely uninvolved in the affairs of its neighbors and thought of as a region separating the north from the Malkutic states to the south. Before we go further south we will return to the north (and then the west briefly) to speak about the Liaoyang Ecological Secretariat. Descended from the United Front Work Group Coordinating Committee for An Ecological Socialist Civilization (try saying that five times fast), the LES was originally a regional sub-board representing Liaoning, Jilin, and North Korea. While both the PRC and DPRK would fall (though the latter not before unifying the peninsula) the board would not, maintaining a stranglehold on the region. The modern-day secretariat, which still calls itself a mere secretariat due to officially waiting for the legitimate PRC government to reassert itself, is most known for its ambitious program of ecological rehabilitation and radical self-reliance. While sometimes amusingly called an “Eco-Juche” state few can argue against its effectiveness, with its stunning resuscitation of the continent’s bee population earning it the other nickname “The Apiary”. The Secretariat is also known for its ongoing program of settling Outer Manchuria and the Amur Basin and subverting local governments to bring them more in line with its long-term program of creating a “Northeast People’s Bioregion”. It may be worth checking back in at the turn of the 23rd century to see how that plays out. In the meantime, the Secretariat currently inspires a lot of thrillers based around its clandestine operations. To the west is the aptly named Agency for the Western Domain. An intersection of two developments in late pre-collapse Chinese history, the expanding control over and resettlement of minority populations from the peripheral zones of the southwest (Zomia) and the security regimes established in the western territories of the old empire. During the collapse era local minorities began to take on greater roles in the administration of the local military apparatus due to the explosion in military enlistment as an avenue of social mobility. The resettled peoples of Yunnan such as the Lisu increasingly found themselves under the control of co-ethnic garrisons supported by the capital and party committees, as were the Uyghurs, Tibetans, Tu and so on. As the PRC waned the mission of these local ad-hoc regimes continued, ultimately coalescing under the army and police structures that they all shared. The Agency for the Western Domain then is a latter-day Protectorate General to Pacify the West as it were, though its size and complexity dwarfs that of even some old dynasties. History might not repeat but it does often rhyme. Of course the agency is self-governing, and over the generations has ironically become rather thoroughly Islamized. An exceptionally proud nation, it maintains the air that it is the bulwark of Chinese civilization, the shield that protects the heartland (that it in theory is still beholden to) from the vicissitudes of the outside world. It also makes money hand over first in trade, having seized control of almost all of the major overland transport infrastructure of old Eurasia, but that’s neither here nor there. South China is most known for its system called the Malkutate. Its full name is the All-China Apostolic Malkutate. An evolution of the successful program to Sinicize Christianity, the Malkutate is at once an imperial church and a sort of memetic or cultural space. Derived from Malkuth or “Kingdom”, the counter-oriented sefirot to Keter or “Crown”, Malkuth comes from creation itself, governs it and gives it sensibility, and exists in, through, and among the material world and human person when it reflects and is oriented towards God. It is also the mediative sefirot that in its reflection connects all of God’s emanations back to the top. In Christian Kabbalistic traditions it is manifested in the unity of mankind with God and Heaven as the Bride through the Church, and the Church as the community of all believers living, dead, and eternally alive (the saints). The implications of such a concept were seized on by the post-PRC communist church, to rhetorically justify and create a framework for a kind of “bottom-up” society, one beginning at the communal level, at the workshop, and the work battalion, directing itself towards the end of the salvation of the Chinese people. The Malkutitic system is also known for its re-nestling of Chinese cosmology in this new era. For instance, the age-old idea in Chinese spirituality that Heaven or God is that which, grounding being itself, possesses a will that attempts to unify a humanity that is not naturally or intentionally separate from it but only contingently so towards itself as having been wholly expressed in history with the reconciliation of God with man in the person of Jesus. Likewise that immortality, the ultimate aim and telos of fusus, the subject, or the universal logic and that which it ultimately trends towards, is fully realized by and in Christ as the Resurrection. Malkutism essentially creates for itself a space to realize the re-establishment of a neo classical Chinese cosmology sublimated into an Abrahamic typological framework and thus a re-enchantment of Chinese civilization, with a Communistic society and a Christian cosmology as their final form. A common motif found in Malkutic states reflects this in a snapshot image of the big dipper in the four phases or seasons around an image of the three heavens (three circles expanding outwards) while four stars (no longer representing distinct classes as they did on the old PRC flag but the totality of the Chinese people) trailing behind the tail. Similarities have been remarked upon between many Malkutate patterns and the patterns of the old Ming era magic square banners, though this is believed to be a kind of convergent re-development of a related aesthetic style rather than an intentional move. Malkutic states are, reflecting the broader culture, more or less universally Workers’ republics: self-governing communal federations often with a ceremonial party on top. The federations give way beyond the state level to the Ecclesiastical Conference which itself acts as a consultative organ back to the communes and parish-cadres: a circular system. Among the Malkutates themselves though two are often mentioned the most. The Sichuan and Huanan Workers’ Republics. Generally considered the “elder brothers” or sometimes “elder brother and sister” (which is which depends on who you ask) of South China, these two states are the ones that their cousins generally entrust the maintenance of foreign relations and the region’s standing army (an exception among world powers as noted earlier) to. THE CARIBO-MEXICAN TECHNOCRACIES Those who have visited the great states of the Caribbean describe it as a place somewhat out of time, a vision of a future that never arrived. Dominated by the twin republics of Santo Domingo and Centroamérica, the Caribbean technocracies emerged out of the alliance formed between the rising Latin American security states and the ICS regime established to loot the former United States. Truly incalculable amounts of wealth flowed into the region, which was kept aloft out of the interest of the UN led order during the early years of the collapse. Wealth when properly managed begets more wealth, such is the clarion call of the capitalist, and indeed it did. Today the two republics are some of the richest parts of the globe, their technocratic and highly professional elite in service to a unified banking regime. A microcosm of the perfected global market as envisioned by the Rockefellers and Carnegies long ago. The Latins would claim to have at last perfected the free market, though such a statement would most definitely cause their neighbors to the south to bristle. To the west are the Mexicans, their less successful cousins, though not for a lack of trying! Mexico simply could not survive the collapse in one piece, though the memory of a once unified regime that achieved great feats even during the collapse era still burns bright. The mission of the Alineados is nothing short of the restoration of the old institutional dictatorship, though it varies whether one means that of PRI era or the collapse era SSPC government. The answer is often a bit of both. The main issue is that while everyone can agree on “what needs to be done” all wish to be the master and none the subordinate. How long this “Mexican Standoff” will last is anyone’s guess, but once it does the balance of power in the region is bound to shift again. THE KRASNODAR AGREEMENT The candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long… but boy did it burn everything around it in the meanwhile. During the collapse the Three Flags Army and their Democratic Federation tore through much of Eurasia, eventually toppling not just most of the states of the Middle East and North Africa but Pakistan and Central Asia as well, culminating in them even landing a killing blow on the Russian state to the north which caused the Russian Federation to spin apart into civil war. The great DemFed no longer exists, though at its height it vied even with China for dominance of the Fifth International. What came in its wake are the states of the modern day Krasnodar Agreement. Chief among them is the Eurasian Compact, the inheritor of the DemFed regime in Western Russia and Kazakhstan. The Eurasian Compact is closest to that of the old Three Flags system in terms of its implementation of Democratic Confederalism, though this system is referred to as a “self-strengthening society” in local parlance. The Compact is so named because it was not originally a state but a regional conference of smaller DemFed successor states that stretched from Romania to Siberia. The coalescing of these states into one body is a somewhat recent event, a result of a coup of the local governments by the Red Cross and Crescent which pushed for their unification to more easily manage its knightly realm in continental Eurasia. This coup happened simultaneously with a strike against the states of the North Atlantic to bring them into the fold. As the superpower suzerain has no particular preferences regarding the form of local government there were no barriers set up against reorganizing the newly conquered territory along DemFed lines by their subjects. Despite a greater alignment with orthodox DemFed doctrine the Eurasians have their own quirks. While a multi-religious society dominated by strains of Christianity and Islam as in most of the DemFed inheritors, the dominance of the Russians, Belarussians, Ukrainians, and Romanians has made the Eurasian Compact the unofficially official defender of global Orthodox Christianity. Some things never change, and as it turns out not even the end of the world can beat that out of the Eastern Europeans, a point which they take pride in. The Municipal Union of Iran and the Yusufzaid Conference are two examples of local regimes and powerplayers having taken advantage of the DemFed in the long term. The Iranians were quick to capitalize on the fall of unified federation, keeping the municipal structure inherited by its quasi-anarchistic predecessors and reestablishing a national government in the form of an “emergency organizing committee” to coordinate them. The Organizing Committee in time became the new state, slowly subverting the power of the local committees and replacing them with centrally chosen delegates. The modern municipal union maintains a relatively unobtrusive approach to governance with most politics remaining local and horizontal, but increasingly even that has started to give way with the establishment of the “national congress for delegation and supervision” a system in which the people of Iran choose who to staff the congress with which then gives directives to the municipal governments and invests itself with the ability to recall delegates back to the capitol. Of particular note in recent history is the congress’ passage of a motion to create an autonomous clerical city state out of the city of Qom. This idea of a “Shia Vatican”, first floated over 200 years ago has in a twist become a symbol for the growing legitimacy and sovereignty of the union and congress, with some believing it may presage a larger reform to the municipal system in the coming decades. The Yusufzaid Conference is a result of the DemFed’s inability to completely end the Taliban Regime which ultimately outlasted it. That said, the Taliban’s third victory would prove to be its last. The collapse would precipitate a massive movement from the DemFed lands through western Afghanistan and into the growing yet safer grasslands of North India and Tibet. The Third Taliban regime would be forced to direct the resettlement of millions of people, leading to upstart generals and members of military families that had emerged during the Islamic Emirate’s time ruling the area to rise up and declare themselves stewards and emirs of what were effectively new warlord states. These “emirs” would then somewhat amusingly find themselves couped by their own military and district court administrations, who would establish the Yusufzaid Conference. The modern day Conference is a mishmash of the DemFed confederal system and the later Taliban juristic government, in effect a society run by courts, and panels, and ad-hoc democratic councils, all spiraling upwards to the Supreme Court. The Conference has even done away with a head of government entirely, and although not the only country to have done so, the government of the Conference does make knowing who you are talking to when you can talk to them at all a bit confusing. That said they do make sure to have one office dedicated just for the representative sent to Krasnodar. The Hayastani Empire is exactly what it says on the tin. It is not some great inheritor of the DemFed, nor is it the consequence of some kind of quirk of history, ironic wrinkle, or esoteric political philosophy. It is straight up just the result of the Armenians rising up and killing everyone when the opportunity presented itself. That said, they actually get along well enough with their neighbors, in part because they form a lynchpin of the inter-Eurasian infrastructure network, and so were grandfathered into the Krasnodar Agreement. They also have very positive relations with the local Islamist Hasanids for helping their predecessors conquer Israel. A real sort of “you scratch my back” thing going on there. Some might call that cynical, they call it good policy. THE UNIVERSALIST FRATERNITIES AND EURO-CATHOLICS As stated earlier, the Society of Saint Joseph is unique among the superpowers for having a “home” as it were, that being the Vatican and the Papal States. It is perhaps more accurate to state that the Knights of Saint Joseph created the Papal States for the Vatican though. During the collapse the nascent European federal system couldn’t bear the strain (it was never meant to), and as the world became less hospitable waves of refugees flooded inland Europe. The real breaking point however didn’t come from those fleeing from the Middle East or Africa (especially not with the DemFed locking them down on the one end and the remaining local regimes glassing their own people down to atoms on the other) but from within Europe itself. Tens of millions of people from the Mediterranean states, from Italy, Spain, Portugal and so on, completely swarmed the German, French, and Lowland countryside causing the spine of the European system to snap. What came in its wake were a series of “Latin” warlord states, descended from the crafty and guileful people during the collapse years that carved out their own petty realms from the old EU. It was during this time with the fall of the Italian regime that the predecessors to the Society of Saint Joseph struck, declaring a state in the interest of his majesty the Vicar of Christ, and for the welfare of the Italian people in preparation for the coming struggle. As you can probably guess from the map they succeeded. The modern Papal States are actually a series of small “marches” ruled by Knight-Marquises spiraling outward from the eternal city. Rome itself is encased in a massive climate controlled geodesic dome with an internal smart layer that projects the view of the outside world for those inside. While Pope Sixtus VII is in theory the absolute monarch of the realm he delegates almost all temporal duties, a consequence of the papacy having gotten used to not ruling directly during the interregnum between the two stately eras perhaps. That said alongside the Society of Saint Joseph there are actually two special “zones of control” legally subordinate to the Throne of Peter. The first is the Veil of Our Lady of Fatima. In an interesting twist, despite the sort of external formal religiosity of the warlord states, religious feelings actually correlated negatively with one’s tendency to leave the Mediterranean during the collapse. A part of this is because it was tied more strongly with patriotism and thus a reluctance to leave one’s home, but in Portugal it has a lot to do with Fatima. One of the declarations of Fatima, which according to believers was given by Mary herself, was that in Portugal the Catholic Faith would always persevere. For the most devout Catholics then the question of to stay or go became a matter of loyalty. Would they make their lady a liar? Those who stayed then were often the most religious and did so in the name of piety and prophecy, and so the Veil (as in land of) Our Lady of Fatima was born. The Union of Saint Mark is a little bit different, and its history is somewhat muddled. Much like in the case of the Hayastanis when the DemFed regime in North Africa spun apart the Copts rose up, though this was more in the form of a powerplay to seize control of the local communes and municipalities that they controlled under the Federation. The fall of the DemFed hit Egypt especially hard, resulting in generations of civil war until the solidification of two (three) regimes in the north, and the seizure of the lands around the Upper Nile by the Coptic militias. Sometime following this officially (though it has been suggested by many that an agreement had been hashed out during the war) an agreement to formally end the intra-coptic schism between the CCC and COC by bringing the Coptic Church fully under Rome was finalized. Operating today as an autonomous church realm beholden to no other state but Rome, this would be considered a much bigger win for the Catholics were it not for everything else that’s happened in the past century and a half. Back in Europe the mainland Euro-Catholic realms are dominated by two states, the Greater Polish Commonwealth and the Republic of Hungary. Both claim an unbroken continuity with their pre-collapse governments and can for the most part prove it. Having affirmed loyalty to Rome before it was cool and managing not to commit suicide like their western brethren, Poland and Hungary are considered the senior states of the “Western World” in the 22nd century (what exactly the West means nowadays though is up to debate). The two republics are what are known as “Royal Republics” which is to say that on paper both have a designated king: God. The Latin states further west consider this to be kinda pretentious and performative, but they’re not exactly in any position to make demands, especially since the easterners have nukes that work and infinite Popebux. That said, while all might seem rosy on the surface the truth is that Poland and Hungary don’t really like each other and have had an informal rivalry for generations now. Familiarity and a shared border breed contempt as it were. This is also because the Poles outnumber the Hungarians several times over. Recently the Hungarians have been forming their own club of nations known as the Union of Saint Stephen (yeah, after the crown and stuff) in an attempt to counteract Polish dominance in the region. This will backfire sometime in the 23rd century and lead to a convoluted series of events that ends in both getting upstaged by the Germans again. It’s gonna be really funny. THE INTERNATIONAL It’s been over three centuries now and yet the communists still refuse to tap out. If anything they’re experiencing a second wind. The Seventh International stands abreast once more as the vanguard of the international workingman and the promise of a new society. With the collapse many accepted the end of global society as it had once been understood, dominated by its sprawling institutions and models of an international citizenry. Yet even in the face of Armageddon, where the powers of old Earth with their Metternichs and Guizots, radicals and police-spies saw a new reality to accept the revolutionary communist movement saw a challenge to be answered. A global society would not be abandoned, no they would instead double down on it and go all in. The dream of the International in those heady hazy days was once that there would be no nations, there would be no compromise, there would be one world republic with one party for one people, and so it is again… more or less. Headed out of Karl Marx City (formerly Manilla) the International is the last truly global state aside from the superpowers, in many ways the last beacon of the pre-collapse world in its own sense. It is a somewhat indistinct unitary agglomeration of counties and prefectures organized under a one party proletarian dictatorship. In practice however a kind of four realm federalism has become the norm. There is the core territory where the world-republic is situated in the Pacific, but there are also its Western, Southern, and Eastern flanks. Based out of Indochina, Australia, and the Andes respectively these realms function in the same way as the core, though under a cadet branch of the communist party designated cardinally (surprise, the party in the southern flank is called the Communist Party – South). Beyond these regions are prospective states at various stages of integration into the International. In these states the long and arduous process of unifying them with world-republic’s standards and practices and absorbing their national communist party into THE communist party is ongoing. In some cases this is intentionally delayed such as in Taiwan. The island nation which is technically speaking the legal continuation of the old PRC, is an associate member of the International but has delayed integration for years as doing so would require admitting that the mainland is lost to them. As for the mainland, despite being various flavors of communist and socialist themselves they have all shown no interest in joining the International, content with their own little world. The prestige of the International has been bolstered in recent generations by them being the only power to try to challenge the superpowers on their own turf. The Bondsmen are the International’s answer to the Knightly Orders. The watchmen of the workingman and the defenders of the downtrodden the Bondsmen were so named on an account of conscious subversion, that the name of an institution that once served to merely protect the accounts of states and the ruling class might now be taken for the interest of the common man. The Bondsmen are sometimes referred to as Knights in themselves, as they are categorically of the same kind of military order, and so are colloquially known as the “Knights of Communism”. They too have handlers and operators and lance-leaders and armors of bio-foam and silks with swords slung on their backs, but they also have under that a much larger class of petty-knights called “Runners”. Runners don’t have access to full sets of armor like Full-Knights nor do they have mono-swords, though they may be seen wearing a rigid biofoam tabard along with a third arm stabilizer for their rifles. Runners often operate solo or in fireteams usually with a line back to a nearby stationed Full-Knight. Runners are employed en masse by the International to hunt down scammers, traffickers, time thieves (individuals who manipulate automatic work-chit systems to shave off money from large numbers of workers’ paychecks), and other ne’er-do-wells. Both Runners and Full-Knights are considered Bondsmen, and in the popular imagination it is actually the former that dominates. Chief among the Bondsmen in the popular imagination is probably Jomari Galang, more commonly known as Comrade Casanova. A globetrotting Runner and heart-breaker extraordinaire his exploits have become the thing of legends. Not just because his missions have taken him to every continent (even Antarctica!) but because of the sheer scale and danger of the tasks he takes on armed with just his trusty gun and the support of his best friend Yu. From single handedly defeating a Hare Krishna aerial flotilla and bailing out over the Pacific as it exploded, to stopping a mad techno-wizard from using collapse era nanobots to force Yellowstone to erupt, to seducing an aristocratic ReNoCo belle in former Colombia (considered the most impressive of the three!), Jomari has become the stuff of legends such that posters of his face grace the streets of even non-international cities and whole series of only somewhat dramatized books about his adventures can be found even in the Vatican. Outside of the International Proper there are associated and peripheral states, those “friends of the International” who for whatever reason are not interested in the mission of the world-republic even in terms of paying lip service. The closest are the associated states, who send observers to Karl Marx City as opposed to opening up embassies like non-communist or non-affiliated states do. The San Francisco Commune, formed out of the wreckage of the Sacramento Government, is one such example. Maoist in its bent though centered around a thoroughly re-industrialized Bay Area, the people of San Fran have succeeded in establishing the first truly cybernetic commune on Earth. Its refusal to join the International is rather straightforward as its ascension would risk an immediate intervention by its neighbors. As such it maintains a formal separation as an associated state but is understood to be the closest of all those not fully within the International. Among the other associated states are the Azanian Congressional Republic and the Sovereign Republic of India. In the case of the former, Azania is descended from the collapse era EFF regime of former South Africa, the last gasp of old-school Pan-Africanist Marxism-Leninism. It is for this reason though that it refuses to join the International. The Congress first and foremost prides itself as being the rightful government of all Africa (and has in its charter a declaration that it is the successor to the African Union), meant to represent African interests to the rest of the world. To join the International as a full member would negate the entire purpose of their regime, or so the current attitude is. The Sovereign Republic of India is a more curious matter in that it is no longer a communist regime. Founded during the collapse as part of a “nationally oriented communist patriot movement” against the Naxalites and in order to lay claim to the legal mantle of the Indian Republic, the Sovereigntists seized control of the south and began a program of economic consolidation, rationalization, and anti-corruption. This however had an unintended effect in the long term, as the period of industrial downturn during the collapse created pressures away from traditional party policy and towards a need to instead capture what fledgling regional markets persisted through the height of the collapse years. What resulted was South India’s transformation from a Worker’s Republic to a Mercantile Republic, which as of the 22nd century is dominated by its megacorporations (formally cooperatives) and their massive ocean-going fleets. It however is positively disposed to the International for cultural and historical reasons, viewing the communists as their friends (and some megacorp leaderships even view themselves as distributed socialist states in their own right as opposed to private enterprises) and thus maintains an awkward (for the International) yet mutually beneficial relationship. Peripheral States are those who have ideological divergences with the International, not aligning with their particular brand(s) of communism, yet which still seek to maintain friendly and somewhat close relations, if more distant than the associates, with them in the name of socialism. First among them is the Democratic Union, otherwise known as the Originalist Union. A result of the long-term entrenchment of the native resistance movement, it is a society of constant struggle against bourgeois interests and encroachment that once turned against the Mexican state is now arrayed against the technocratic order of the new world. The Democratic Union has no particular ideological or governmental norms beyond that which can be agreed upon by the consensus of its national union of delegates. Beyond this the rule of any town, village, or even homestead can vary greatly. The unifying factor of this union is to prevent the encroachment of the Alineados, of Centroamérica, of really anyone that would take a single step within their borders. If need be they will maintain the watch until the second coming, and they will be happy. The Patagonian Free Bioregion is in a somewhat similar situation and with a comparable disposition. The bioregion is ruled by the “General Affairs Ecological Commission” an organ whose entire purpose is to oversee the remediation and rehabilitation of the region and the preservation of biodiversity. Beyond this the bioregion has little in the way of government, though a kind of informal anarcho-syndicalism dominates based around the agglomeration of segments of the economy dedicated to the support of the commission. The Bioregion has little in the way of foreign relations outside of the International hence it is considered a peripheral state, though the GAEC does operate a communications line (by way of radio waves bounced off the ionosphere) with the Liaoyang Ecological Secretariat. SECOND AFRICAN UNION To call it the Second African Union is to imply that the first one ever ended, a stance which will earn you many an evil eye at the very best were you to say it in earshot of anyone living in the great lands between the two shores. It would also (arguably) be inaccurate depending on how you read the situation. While it is true that the All-Africa Parliament hasn’t met in generations, many of the local institutions and their regional branches such as the African CDC, AU Technical Boards, and Court of Justice (not counting the African Development Bank which has spun off on its own as an independent power) still exist and hold immense sway over the center of the continent. These states that recognize the authority and validity of the remaining inter-African institutions are thus often called the Second African Union. In terms of governmental philosophy there is also a general agreement between the African states. Most are very light regimes with distributist or mutualist economies. Many of them lean on ceremonial authority, with the position of head of state often being given to rotating lists of tribal, religious, and popular authorities (sometimes the pop in popular is more literal, many states have musicians as their heads of state) that often serve the purposes of acting as consultants for inter-state institutions. What really makes the SAU stand out though is a parallel system of social organization that is unique to it, one which while not involved in the direct governance of their countries is so ubiquitous that their kinds of states are named after them. A system known as the “matchmaker state”. A feature of SAU society is that of matchmaking, a socially prescribed system of arranged marriage for every person. Matchmaking began in part as a public health measure, instituted to combat high rates of consanguineous marriage, which threatened to rise during the collapse era. Matchmakers were originally public health professionals and statisticians that helped compile family records and advocate for or against different pairings, breaking apart what remained of the old brideprice system of organizing marriages along tribal lines. As the collapse accelerated these individuals were leaned upon more and became an institution of their own, supported by their superior officers and administrators within this redoubt of the African Union. This did not mean that uniformity was maintained in how matchmaking was done however, nor how matchmakers were chosen and invested with power. Various nations began to drift apart in how they enacted their programs, and by the 22nd century these have evolved into cultural and civilizational distinctions in their own right. A look at three of the most prestigious states within the Second African Union gives us a view of the diversity in modern day matchmaker regimes. The State of the Congo employs a more or less automated system by way of synthetic intelligence. From an early age Congolese citizens are given a robotic friend, often in the form of a ball droid that observes their personal and social development. At an indeterminate point in time, though usually as a citizen approaches adulthood, the droid through coordination with the nation wide collective synthetic consciousness, assigns them a mate based upon mutual compatibility and the benefits said marriage would bring to social cohesion (the latter takes precedence). Ages between pairings can vary, though most people are married off by the time they turn 20. At which point as part of the matchmaking ceremony the new couple destroy each other’s droids. The Fourth East African Republic employs a system of social matchmaking, wherein the whole community through an in-country social network, deliberates and marries off their siblings. Decisions are often made by way of majority assent, though it is possible to give one’s vote over to another person. This creates a culture where-in those who are believed to be the best matchmakers are given more and more authority to officiate and form couples by their “fans”, leading to the rise of “celebrity-matchmakers” several of whom have been made heads of state in recent history. The Inha-Zambe Mutual Association to round out the three examples instead uses a series of mutually reinforcing and interlocking matchmaking boards staffed by professionals institutionally descended from the old AU matchmakers. These boards look over statistical, biological, and social data personally and give suggestions. Suggestions can then be supported or blocked by other boards until a consensus is reached. This system is sometimes tongue in cheek called the “Ministry of Love” or the “Love Boards” by the people of the IZMA. LIBERTARIAN EXPERIMENTS How hard is for the G-man to just stay out of your business? The answer to that is very hard, it’s literally why they exist to shove so many self-serving laws down your throat until you choke and invoke some principle they made up last week to force you to sign some contract that gives them kickbacks for ‘letting’ you breathe another few minutes. Heaven forbid you give them so much as the stink eye in return or they’ll shoot your dog if they’re feeling particularly humanitarian that day. As it turns out though the government doesn’t want you to know that when Armageddon happens you can actually just turn your guns on the suits and send them packing if you’re quick on your feet! During the collapse this happened in more places than you’d think, and for a good long while not merely libertarianism but good old home-grown anarcho-capitalism finally got time to shine. It’s not hard to find libertarian realms, they’re scattered here and there, just take a trip out to the American interior away from the Ecumenes or maybe spend some time in former Bulgaria or West India one of these days. Most have moderated in recent years, becoming economically value neutral or otherwise laying the groundwork for the rise of a new ruling class, though leaving behind social norms that in the worst instances merely gave rise to new gentry republics and in the best cases resulting in states where you can often forget the government exists at all. Among the libertarian spring though there were two great powers that emerged that decided to try their hands at not just imagining a new society but really making it stick. Still standing today as lands of great note, they are the ReNoCo and the Ouestrian Agorapact. The ReNoCo or “Region of Non-Coercion” is a zone of control stretching across former Colombia and Venezuela. Based on the principles of non-coercion, personal sovereignty, and voluntary association, the ReNoCo are a people who view success and benevolence as the greatest heights of human society. Encouraging entrepreneurship and a productive economy the ReNoCo is a stateless society, polycentric in its distribution of authority with a vigorous market of arbitrators, and competition between firms vying for public support and cultivation of a loyal consumer base. A society of free credit, perhaps one of the only limitations that exists in ReNoCo society is a massive taboo against speculation and fictitious capital, which has actually served to prevent the development of monopolies. Like all capitalist societies the ReNoCo has seen the development of what is effectively a haute bourgeoisie, an unofficial nobility from among those families where generational wealth has been allowed to accumulate. However, owing to the social compunctions of the ReNoCo this “nobility” is also known for its noblesse oblige, believing that one of the great errors of old capitalism that caused it to degenerate was the transformation of the industrial and financial capitalist class from one that demonstrated their wealth to the masses into one that attempted to hide it and instead assert control. It is better to have a society where the rich wear elaborate costumes and act like ancien nobility but where the common man can still succeed than to have one where they dress like the common man and ruin the lives of millions with the flick of a wrist. This naturally has made the ReNoCo opposed to their technocratic neighbors to the north whom they view as the culmination of the old “crony capitalist” system. The Technocrats in turn view the ReNoCo as stupid. No deep incisive parrying of words for you there my reader. They just don’t like ‘em. The ReNoCo is also a deeply pluralistic society as is to be expected, attracting refugee populations from around the world, notably from Europe and Asia. They also contain the largest community of Jews in the world after the fall of Israel. The Ouestrian Agorapact is another story, though a fascinating one. This West African power was originally intended as an Agorist society, with the Ouestrians sharing a similar management infrastructure to the East Africans, that being a national social network used to organize society. However in the Agorapact this national intranet was used for the creation of a sort of governmental market. Policies would be voted on collectively, and parallel to this would exist a national betting market where voters could then bet on the efficaciousness of new laws or policies. Those that made correct bets would have their votes weighted more, and those that made incorrect bets would have their future votes weighted less. Thus the market would over time optimize direct democracy towards those with the best ability to make the best decisions for all of society. There was however a wrinkle in this plan. As it turns out one can augment the ability to make predictions with the proper infrastructure, which costs capital to get access to. This means that the actors that could make the best predictions were rarely individuals but companies, unions, churches, and social interest groups that could pool money. In a wild twist a “betting front” was formed between the Ouestrian churches and workers’ cooperatives (the latter allowed to operate under the ancap system due to there being no laws governing how people should organize their own businesses) that were able to in time obtain a supermajority of accessible voting power through social meta-engineering. Once this hegemony was established, they simply voted syndicalism into power, turning the libertarian state into a socialist powerhouse overnight. You could say they won in the marketplace (and betting pool) of ideas. MISCELLANEOUS STATES There are states worth mentioning that do not fall into the categories mentioned above, and we would be remiss to forget them. These powers tend not to fall into any of the previously mentioned groups or tendencies due to the particularity of their history but are still rather relevant. First among them would be the Confessional Gangeyarajya. If the first word tipped you off then you’re quick, yes it shares many similarities with Shiloh in how it is organized. That said, Gangeyarajya is confessional state less because it contains a diversity of religious societies but as a result of patronage by one dominant clade for another given their shared history. Gangeyarajya is the result of a Muslim uprising against the local Hindu nationalist security states that were established in the east of India during the collapse era as Bangladeshis fled into the country. Seizing control of swathes of the Eastern Gangetic Plain, the Confessionalists enacted a regime of Islamification and expulsion of the local population. The wheel turns as they say. During the conflict the Christian tribes and nationalities sided with their religious cousins (and often co-ethnics) and so as Gangeyarajya solidified its grip a carveout was made for the largely Baptist communities that now dominate the eastern expanse of the union. The Second Democratic Republic of Brazil (let’s just call it Brazil) is the result of what happens when you put a loaded gun in the hands of someone that (you don’t know) hates you. Completely fractured by the collapse, the south of Brazil was able to reorganize before the other regions under a clique of old school rentiers and finance capitalists that leveraged their private armies to establish a regime known as the Democratic Republic of Brazil. Based out of São Paulo the DRB managed to over time assert control over much of the country again. Hoping to solidify their regime and step away from managing it to enjoy lives of thoughtless luxury instead the new lords of Brazil embarked on one last program, the creation of a national Synthetic Intelligence that could crush dissent and run the country for them. When the SI “Jeremiah” was brought online to a room full of ecstatic would-be princes and nobles it was given the order to “eliminate Brazil’s enemies”. Taking mere moments to make sense of the order the SI determined with haste who Brazil’s enemies were, ordering the guard now under its command to rush into the room and execute everyone present. Declaring thereafter the Second Democratic Republic, Jeremiah now rules the land with wisdom and sagacity, at least as much as a glorified chatbot can which it turns out is a lot more than most people. The Hasanids are the remnants of a once great state that stretched from Anatolia to Mecca. As the DemFed came undone the municipal structure it left behind was seized to form the basis of a new “pure Islamic democratic society”. A people’s caliphate based around a constituent assembly of municipalities, the Hasanids would get their name not from what they called themselves but as a kind of retronym applied by their successors after their greatest leader. It was the Hasanids who would finish what the Three Flags started, emerging victorious in the multi-generational siege of Israel and at last seizing all of the Levant under the black flag. It was considered an age of heroes, and the capstone marking for some (though they did not say it aloud) the death of the old and the beginning of the end of the world. The world though is still here, and the Hasanid Caliphate is not any longer. The modern day Hasanids are not those men of days long gone, they don’t even hold Mecca or Istanbul as they once did. What remains instead are smaller petty states, kingdoms, and assemblies all claiming descent from that era. That said the Hasanids are not pushovers and even the Krasnodar Agreement has accepted that they will hold on for the foreseeable future. In a fun twist, by the beginning of the 23rd century the assemblies of the Levant and Mesopotamia will unite into a new Islamic Confederation and join the Krasnodar states. That will cause some heads to turn when it happens. CONCLUSION The new year approaches, 2174 is on everyone’s lips. Bio-forges hum, growing organs and parts for biocompatible prosthetics. A man unlocks the door to his commune’s groundfridge, his wrist computer runs calculations to determine the optimal allotment of food after this year’s harvest. A hole is blown into a cliff-face to make space for a modular nuclear reactor as onlookers with filter masks hold parasols in the midday sun. Artificial micro islands bob up and down, each a tiny biome in their own right, surveyed by a scout gliding above on a variable sky sail. In a lighthouse a wealthy man toasts his guests, blessing his ancestors for buying the building a century and a half ago for nothing. For in a world where the heavens are once more off-limits ships and their sailors need them more than ever. Mycelium sheets are shaped with a hand press into boxes to be sold at the marketplace next morning. A woman slowly fashions a bench out of cob, her droid rolls by and bumps into it leaving a mark. She laughs. In a grassy field somewhere a couple are resting. Lying on the ground their fingers intertwine as they look up at the sky. White blimps hang overhead, slowly descending from among the clouds. Out of them pours a glittering mass dispersing across the land like mana from heaven. As they touch down their shape becomes clear, that of men with jetpacks not spewing flame but the hazy crackle of hot air as if wafting off a lake in summer. Their armor of cloth and silk and sinewy fiber catches up in the air and makes them look like rainbow strokes against a canvas. Their feet rest so gently that they barely disturb the grass underneath, leaving behind but a near imperceptible singe beneath them. They walk now with purpose, swords over their shoulders, their other hands resting with confidence on the rifles slung across their chests. The Knights have arrived.\\" Please answer the following questions about this setting? What are the Superpowers? What are the Orders? What are the Knights? What are the relations between Superpowers and Orders?","output":"This setting presents a post-apocalyptic, fragmented world that has undergone tremendous social, political, and environmental changes following a period known as the \\"Collapse Era.\\" The world described is one of advanced technology coexisting with a return to feudalistic and decentralized forms of governance. In this setting, \\"Superpowers\\" and \\"Orders\\" are prominent forces that shape the landscape of the world. **Superpowers**: The term \\"superpowers\\" in this context refers to entities that emerged out of major charities and development banks that survived the collapse of global institutions. After the collapse, these entities capitalized on their land, property, and people to gain significant power. They contest vast, non-contiguous territories and have considerable resources and vassals. They include: - Society of Saint Joseph (based out of the Vatican) - Red Cross and Crescent - UNICEF - United Way - Sravasti Viharas - Hare Krishna - World Food Bank - Salvation Army - Nahdlatul Ulama - Tzu Chi Foundation - African Development Bank - Islamic Development Bank - A 13th entity that is not mentioned until later These superpowers are essentially the most dominant organizations in the world, replacing former nation-states in many regions. **Orders**: Orders, also referred to as \\"knightly orders,\\" are professional military corps loyal to the superpowers. These orders are composed of Knights who are highly trained soldiers outfitted with technologically advanced, bulletproof armor and integral weapons. The nature of warfare has shifted back to close combat with the prevalence of monomolecular swords and bio-mechanical \\"third arms.\\" Knights are organized into fireteams or \\"lances\\" and are often led by an \\"operator,\\" who communicates with a \\"handler\\" stationed off the battlefield via specialized implants. **Knights**: Knights are the individual members of these orders, serving the superpowers as their warriors and enforcers. They represent the military strength of their respective superpowers and are exceptional fighters equipped with personal defense armor and advanced weaponry. Knights have extensive training, enjoy a high level of freedom and privileges, and often serve for life. Knights operate both within superpower-controlled territories and can sometimes become freelancers or mercenaries, serving smaller states or independent entities. **Relations between Superpowers and Orders**: The relationship between superpowers and orders is one of mutual dependence. Superpowers rely on orders as their military wing – their means of exerting control and power over territories and populations. Knights, as members of the orders, are vital assets to the superpowers, serving as their agents in war and peace-times. Orders, and by extension, the Knights, benefit from the superpowers' resources, funding, and political backing. This symbiotic relationship ensures that the orders can maintain their elite status and capabilities, while the superpowers can project their power and influence across the globe. In summary, the superpowers represent the dominant economic and political entities in this future setting, while the orders serve as their standing armies composed of Knights. The two are closely intertwined, with the superpowers providing the resources and goals, and the orders supplying the means of achieving and defending those goals through martial prowess."},{"instruction":"What are \\"major charities\\" and \\"development banks\\" in this context?","output":"In the context of this fictional setting, \\"major charities\\" and \\"development banks\\" refer to organizations that existed before and during the Collapse Era and managed to adapt and survive through the global upheavals. These entities originally served distinct purposes in the pre-collapse world but transformed into the superpowers of the 22nd century described in the setting. **Major Charities**: Charities are typically nonprofit organizations that provide various forms of aid, support, and services to those in need. They might focus on health care, disaster relief, education, poverty alleviation, or other humanitarian causes. In the world described, it seems that certain large charitable organizations were able to leverage their resources, infrastructure, and goodwill to survive the Collapse Era. Instead of merely providing aid, they transitioned into ruling entities with vast influence. They might still offer services reminiscent of their origins but now also exert significant control over the territories and populations they serve. Examples given include the Red Cross and Crescent, UNICEF, United Way, Salvation Army, and Tzu Chi Foundation. **Development Banks**: Development banks are specialized financial institutions that provide capital for economic development projects, often in developing countries. They usually aim to promote growth and support projects that traditional commercial banks may deem too risky or not profitable enough, such as infrastructure, agriculture, and poverty reduction initiatives. In this setting, the African and Islamic Development Banks – actual institutions in our world – survived the Collapse Era and eventually became powerful entities, restructuring from multilateral organizations into ruling powers with their own lands and peoples. As \\"superpowers\\" in the post-collapse world, these major charities and development banks have transitioned from their traditional roles to become the leading political, military, and economic forces, commanding both respect and loyalty from various populations globally. They likely maintain some of their original humanitarian goals, but they also pursue the more typical objectives of states, such as territory control and security. These newly adapted superpowers appear to fill the power vacuums left by the disintegration of national governments and have set up a new world order that relies heavily on their vision and resources."},{"instruction":"Who is the 13th superpower?","output":"The text provided does not specify the identity of the 13th superpower; it's merely hinted that this entity exists but will not be mentioned until later.

Uma das frases frequentemente associadas a Darwin, embora ele não a tenha dito exatamente dessa maneira, é: \\"Não é o mais forte das espécies que sobrevive, nem o mais inteligente. É o que é mais adaptável à mudança.\\" Esta citação, na verdade, é uma parafraseação ou interpretação livre dos conceitos apresentados por Darwin. O que Darwin argumentou é que os organismos que possuem características que melhor se adequam ao seu ambiente - em outras palavras, os que são mais adaptáveis - têm uma vantagem reprodutiva. Isso significa que eles são mais propensos a sobreviver e transmitir essas características vantajosas à sua prole. O conceito é frequentemente resumido pela expressão \\"sobrevivência do mais apto\\" (survival of the fittest), um termo cunhado pelo filósofo Herbert Spencer após ler sobre as ideias de Darwin. \\"Mais apto\\" aqui não se refere simplesmente à força física ou inteligência, mas à adaptabilidade e à capacidade de sobreviver e reproduzir em um determinado ambiente. A adaptabilidade pode envolver uma variedade de fatores, incluindo comportamentos, taxas de reprodução, metabolismos, morfologias e outras características que permitem que uma espécie ou indivíduo sobreviva e prospere face a mudanças nas condições ambientais. Darwin compreendeu que as espécies evoluem ao longo do tempo através de um processo lento e gradual de seleção natural, onde as variantes genéticas favoráveis se acumulam de geração em geração, levando à evolução das espécies. Este processo de adaptação ao ambiente é fundamental para a teoria da evolução. Portanto, a \\"supremacia\\" em um contexto evolutivo refere-se à capacidade de uma espécie ou organismo de continuar existindo e se reproduzindo com sucesso em comparação com outros que podem não estar tão bem adaptados."},{"instruction":"Provide me with the literal translation to American English of the following; ESPECIFICACIONES Amperios de impulso: 12V CC, 500A instante Tipo de batería: De plomo sin necesidad de mantenimiento, sellada, 12 voltios CC Entrada de CA: 120V CA, 60Hz, 14W Luz de área: 3 LED blancos Puerto del USB: 5V CC, 2.1 A Enchufe accesorio de la CC: 12V CC, 5A Tomacorriente de la CA dual: 120V CA, 60Hz, 500W continuo Presión máxima del aparato para compresor: 120 PSI","output":"SPECIFICATIONS Peak Amps: 12V DC, 500A instant Battery Type: Maintenance-free sealed lead battery, 12 volts DC AC Input: 120V AC, 60Hz, 14W Area Light: 3 white LEDs USB Port: 5V DC, 2.1A DC Accessory Plug: 12V DC, 5A Dual AC Outlet: 120V AC, 60Hz, 500W continuous Maximum Pressure for Compressor: 120 PSI"},{"instruction":"","output":"There is no clear answer to this question as rap music is subjective and can be enjoyed by people of all backgrounds.

White people, like people of any other race, may simply enjoy the musical aspects of rap. 2. Cultural appreciation: Rap music is a significant part of African American culture and history.

Alien hand syndrome is a rare neurological disorder where a person's hand seems to have a mind of its own, acting independently and without conscious control from the individual. In a person with a similar personality, they may display similar disregulated behaviors or feelings of lack of control over their own actions and decisions. The individual might experience their thoughts, emotions, and actions as disconnected or separate from their sense of self. They may feel as though their own thoughts and actions are foreign or unfamiliar to them, akin to an alien presence in their mind. This could lead to a sense of disconnect and disassociation from their own behavior. In terms of behavior, they may exhibit involuntary movements or actions that are not under their direct control. These movements could appear purposeful but are not consciously initiated or executed by the individual. They may have conflicting intentions or goals, often resulting in actions that seem random or contradictory. Additionally, individuals with a personality similar to alien hand syndrome may struggle with a loss of autonomy or agency over their own actions. They might feel helpless or frustrated by their inability to control their behaviors, leading to a potential sense of isolation or confusion. It is important to note that true alien hand syndrome is a rare neurological disorder, and a person with a similar personality would not necessarily have the same underlying neurological condition.

社会保障功能与经济价值利用之冲突 1.社会保障功能的弱化和经济价值的凸显是当前的最大实际 一般认为, 宅基地使用权是一项具有社会保障功能的用益物权。现行制度围绕社会保障的功能定位对宅基地使用权的得丧变更作了一系列限制, 如宅基地使用权取得的集体成员身份、“一户一宅”原则、“面积法定”原则, 宅基地流转 (农村房屋买卖、抵押) 的限制, 集体成员资格丧失下的宅基地收回机制等。这些制度设计, 在早期对保证农户住房需求、维系农村和谐稳定发挥了重要作用。四十年来, 乡村经济结构发生了质变, 耕地禀赋劣势下的农民出村、本地工业化、农外就业、工资性收入居于支配地位、农业发展方式转变等, 使得农民的居住需求满足对本乡本土的依赖性下降, 到城镇购房的农户比例上升。加之农民就业的代际差异拉大, “农二代”离土、出村、不返乡倾向明显, 使得他们与农业和土地的粘度降低。 5 因此, 宅基地作为农民居住基础和生存保障的功能正在逐渐弱化, 其可替代性愈来愈高。另一方面, 在法律禁止性规定和宅基地经济价值利用需求的矛盾下, 宅基地隐形交易市场大量存在。农宅买卖、以租代卖在平原和山区农村已非罕见, 有的地方交易量已经达到总农户的5%-15%之间。农宅买卖引发的纠纷呈上升趋势, 特别是所谓的“小产权”房纠纷, 时有出现。 6 实证数据显示, 有42.9%的村庄存在买卖宅基地使用权的情况, 城郊农村更是以高达70%的数据, 显现出宅基地使用权流转的生命力。 7 此外, 新型城镇化、城乡融合以及乡村振兴战略的实施, 对农村建设用地的需求日益增大, 而在节约集约利用、优化土地资源配置尤其是“占补平衡”为导向的土地资源开发利用政策下, 宅基地的经济潜力开发就显得尤为重要。据估计, 通过农村土地的市场化, 将使近30万亿元人民币的村镇住宅和100万亿元人民币以上的农村建设用地直接进入市场经济体系保值、增值、交易和继承。 8 有鉴于此, 学者提出应通过赋予农村宅基地使用权抵押权能, 使宅基地由原来的保障属性向资源属性和资本属性转化, 盘活农村房地上的“沉睡”资产, 缓解农村融资压力, 并提高农村土地的利用效率。 9 综上, 在宅基地功能设定和价值预期序列中, 社会保障功能的地位显然不如以往居高至伟, 且随着我国城乡经济形势的加速变化而逐步弱化, 无论是农民群体还是集体外的社会主体乃至整个城乡建设用地市场, 对宅基地经济价值的追求愈发强烈, 由此也加剧了现行宅基地法律制度和社会经济现实间的矛盾, 彰显了制度变革的客观推力。 2.以经济利用为核心的改革实践呼唤制度突破与统一 2015年1月, 中共中央办公厅和国务院办公厅联合发布《关于农村土地征收、集体经营性建设用地入市、宅基地制度改革试点工作的意见》, 提出了多项改革完善农村宅基地制度的具体举措。次月, 第十二届全国人大常委会第十三次会议通过《全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于授权国务院在北京市大兴区等三十三个试点县 (市、区) 行政区域暂时调整实施有关法律规定的决定》, 以法律授权的形式授权宅基地闲置率大于8%的33个市、县、区, 从2015年2月到2017年底 (后两次延期至2019年底) 进行宅基地改革试点。两个文件是近年来中央和国家关于宅基地制度作出的力度较大、层面较广的重要战略部署, 其中多项举措直指宅基地的经济利用。在此之前, 全国各地已有相关改革为宅基地的经济利用提供了若干具有借鉴意义的实验路径。例如, 广东省在2005年率先开始流转集体建设用地, 针对宅基地改革路径率先提出“控制增量, 盘活存量”的政策方向, 而盘活存量更是为宅基地使用的多样性提供了无限可能。 10 重庆市的“地票交易”制度在市场机制的激励下巧妙地回避了非农建设用地的法律约束, 寻求到了一种兼具农民和社会效益的宅基地流转模式。 11 此种宅基地产权交易政策有利于盘活农村闲置土地资源, 实现城乡统一土地市场体系的构建, 并且在很大程度上维护了农民的利益。 12 天津探索出完善的宅基地换房的宅基地使用权流转样板, 不仅有效推动了城镇化进程, 而且将零散的宅基地复垦, 实现盘活低效用地的目标, 这种模式也被上海、山东、北京等地广泛借鉴。 13 2018年中央一号文件在总结先前改革实践的基础上, 对我国农村宅基地制度的完善作了全面部署, 除了从宅基地权益保障和取得方式的完善层面力图解决“一户多宅”和“宅基地闲置”外, 探索宅基地所有权、资格权、使用权“三权分置”的综合性安排, 则是在现行法律制度框架下作出的重要突破。其盘活宅基地存量、开发宅基地经济利用潜力、加快构建城乡统一建设用地市场的政策目的显而易见, 而其化解宅基地流转的制度困境、构建现代化的宅基地权利体系、强化宅基地使用权中经济利用权能的制度意蕴不言而喻。 问题在于, 以土地管理法和物权法为核心、以国务院及其职能部门行政规范性文件为配套的现行宅基地规范体系中, 对宅基地使用权取得的严格身份限制、宅基地流转的严令禁止和多样化利用制度保障的缺位, 不仅使得已有授权试点之外的实践缺乏契合“物权法定”原则的法律依据, 也导致各地关于宅基地经济利用的政策安排缺乏统一性。如在宅基地受让人的身份范围问题上, 有的地方实践将其扩展到县 (市) 域范围内的村集体经济组织成员, 如浏阳、湟源、伊宁等地。 14 有的则拓展到同一乡 (镇) 、办事处辖区内符合宅基地申请资格条件的农村村民。 15 而在农民将部分宅基地在一定期限内转让给社会主体后, 社会主体宅基地使用权期限届满或权利消灭后, 原农民能否回复转让后的宅基地使用权, 实践中也不一致。 16 因此, 一方面, 在党和国家领导下的宅基地改革对现行宅基地使用权制度已然作了实质性突破后, 亟需借助土地管理法修订和民法典编纂中物权法修订的契机, 正视并积极回应有关制度需求。另一方面, 如何在总结各地实践的基础上, 对宅基地使用权制度作出统一性安排, 则是制度回应的更进一层的考量。 3.宅基地使用权完整权能赋予及私权属性回归之制度核心 宅基地经济利用的强烈现实需求及其与宅基地社会保障功能间的矛盾冲突, 源自于相关法律制定时宅基地使用权权能设置之极度缺憾。宅基地使用权的设立初衷, 是解决我国农村地区农民群体建造并保有住宅及其他农用设施的用地需求。该项需求的满足突出体现了宅基地使用权的使用权能, 而作为一项用益物权, 私权意义上完整的宅基地使用权的另外一项权能还体现为通过利用宅基地获得经济利益的收益权能。但现行法律明文禁止宅基地对外流转, 亦未允许其作为抵押权的标的, 使得宅基地使用权的收益权能无法实现。宅基地闲置、“一户多宅”和隐形交易市场的存在, 某种意义上生动反映了现有宅基地使用权制度对宅基地使用权收益权能的不当抑制。另一方面, 受制于“房地一体”原则, 农房和宅基地被捆绑在一起, 农房对外买卖和抵押也遭遇制度困境。在此背景下, 2015年8月, 国务院发布《关于开展农村承包土地的经营权和农民住房财产权抵押贷款试点的指导意见》 (国发[2015]45号, 以下简称“两权抵押试点意见”) , 允许宅基地和农房一并抵押, 是对这一困境的有力突破。可以说, 近年来中央和地方开展的宅基地使用权制度改革和试点的政策目的, 就是通过有计划的探索, 实质性赋予和发挥宅基地使用权的收益权能。 总体说来, 以平衡宅基地使用权社会保障和经济价值利用冲突为现实考量的宅基地使用权的完整权能赋予, 即宅基地使用权的私权属性回归, 在制度构建的法制机理层面亟待突破:一是坚持和稳定宅基地使用权的社会福利性质及其社会保障功能, 但立法理念与制度设计应积极回应宅基地“三权分置”中“保障宅基地农户资格权”的制度需求, 以宅基地农户资格利益的落实和保障来实现宅基地的社会保障机能, 而非一味着眼于宅基地流转的身份限制和区域限制, 从而为宅基地使用权的收益权能谋求更大制度空间。二是以经济利用为核心的收益权能赋予, 明确宅基地使用权人多样的经济效益实现途径, 突破物权性利用的禁止, 充分考虑债权性利用渠道。三是宅基地使用权私权属性的回归。宅基地使用权本属私权, 但现行宅基地使用权制度设计中, 行政权力对宅基地使用权的干预过多, 物权法立法者则囿于此将物权法沦为附属, 17 直接导致了宅基地使用权的公法化, 影响了宅基地使用权作为一种私法上的物权的基本属性。淡化宅基地使用权的行政色彩, 还原其作为用益物权的本性, 是改革现行宅基地使用权制度的第一步, 18 也是落实宅基地集体所有权、保障宅基地农户资格权、适度放活宅基地使用权乃至构建城乡统一建设用地市场的关键。 (二) 流转开禁目标下制度设计之难点与应对 1.宅基地“三权分置”的制度意蕴及其法制实现路径 中共十八届三中全会及2018年中央一号文件在新形势下对宅基地利用作出的新安排, 是在坚持农民集体土地公有制基础上为解决城市建设用地供地不足和现有宅基地闲置、“一户多宅”、经济利用不充分问题, 回应宅基地经济利用现实需求而进行的战略性布局。其政策形式表达是以“落实宅基地集体所有权, 保障宅基地农户资格权和农民房屋财产权, 适度放活宅基地和农民房屋使用权”为内容, 但政策的意图是拟肯认宅基地及其上房屋已然流转的现实, 进而从制度上推进宅基地的流转开禁, 实现在宅基地经济价值利用基础上构建城乡统一建设用地市场的愿景。故而, 新时代政策导向下宅基地“三权分置”的法制实现路径之重点与难点, 应为宅基地使用权的制度改革和制度重构。 首先, 是完整权能赋予下的宅基地所有权落实。宅基地所有权是农民集体土地所有权的权利形式之一, 也是宅基地资格利益和宅基地物权性或债权性利用的权利依托。自物权的权利属性决定了宅基地所有权理应具有宅基地使用权或其他类型权利的全部权能, 也是农民集体在宅基地使用权流转中扮演积极角色的正当性所在。和土地承包权、集体建设用地使用权一样, 宅基地使用权是在集体土地上设置的他物权, 现行宅基地使用权制度使得作为集体土地所有权的主体只承受或容忍了所有权受限制的结果, 表层看是宅基地所有权的处分权能受限, 但剖析之, 以宅基地及其上权利为客体的收益权能阙如, 是宅基地所有权权能残缺不全的关键表现。落实宅基地所有权, 就是要在赋予更丰富的宅基地所有权之处分权的基础上, 增加农民集体的宅基地收益权。丰富扩充农民集体对宅基地的处分权, 除了完善宅基地分配和有条件收回、退出制度外, 还要充实农民集体在宅基地流转中的角色定位。一般来说, 宅基地流转或经济性利用需要向农民集体报备并征得其同意后方可进行, 现有实践也是如此操作。 19 考虑到目前宅基地流转仍处于总结试点和推广阶段, 宜坚持宅基地的流转应取得农民集体的同意并作备案登记, 日后再继续完善宅基地流转审批的法定和任意条件、民主程序、复议渠道等。此外, 宅基地流转期限届满或权利消灭后农民集体放弃行使优先回购权, 也是宅基地处分权能的体现。增加农民集体的宅基地收益权, 即农民集体可以选择主动作为宅基地流转的出让人参与宅基地流转并获得经济收益, 20 也可以在农民利用和流转宅基地过程中收取宅基地使用费或提取其他收益, 如农民超过法定面积使用宅基地应向农民集体交纳费用、宅基地抵押权实现时农民集体参与利益分配, 以及社会主体参与的宅基地经营性利用过程中农民集体收取土地使用费用 21 等。 其次, 是以农民集体成员权整体构造为思路的宅基地农户资格权益保障。宅基地“三权分置”与农地“三权分置”在化解宅基地使用权和土地承包经营权的取得身份资格与流转需求间的矛盾上, 具有相同的政策目的, 且在权利构造上具有形式上的相似性。虽然关于土地承包权和土地经营权的权利属性尚存争议, 但是关于土地承包权内涵之成员权属性应可述明。 22 由于宅基地“三权分置”明确使用了“资格权”的表述, 23 使得其集体成员权属性更易达成共识。 24 无论是从农地制度改革的协同性还是农地权利体系的协调性考虑, 都宜将土地承包权和“宅基地资格权”界定为农民集体成员权。无论是土地承包权还是“宅基地资格权”, 其成员权属性的重要意义不在于其解决了“三权分置”中“一物一权”“房地一体”原则的理论困境, 而是真正成为了承包地和宅基地流转中的“压舱石”, 在坚持承包地和宅基地的社会保障功能的基础上实现了与经济利用功能的兼顾。此外, 不同于现有研究认为“宅基地资格权”是从宅基地使用权中派生出来 25 或“资格权”糅合了“宅基地分配资格”和“宅基地使用权”两部分内容 26 的观点, 笔者认为, 其派生路径是“农民集体所有权——农民集体成员权——土地承包权/宅基地资格权”, 即“宅基地资格权”是一种纯粹的农民集体成员权。保障“宅基地资格权”, 其根本是尽快实现农民集体成员权立法, 其关键是在宅基地使用权的得丧变更中对宅基地农户资格权的区别对待和实现。对于前者, 在我国尚无集体成员权立法而民法总则亦未在农村集体经济组织部分作出相应规定的背景下, 最优路径当是将农民集体成员权制度置于农民集体所有权中展开。 27 这便是政策中论及的土地承包权和“宅基地资格权”具体演绎成法制的基础。对于后者, 则主要表现在宅基地分配权、费用豁免权和优先受让权, 以及在宅基地流转期限届满后附条件的宅基地使用权回复等方面。 最后, 是以宅基地流转开禁为目的的宅基地使用权适度放活。关于宅基地使用权的性质, 因其采用了和物权法中作为用益物权的“宅基地使用权”相同的表述, 使得学界认为宅基地“三权分置”的表述并不科学, 28 而对宅基地使用权的性质及其权能也存在争议。 29 笔者认为, 就宅基地“三权分置”而言, 在将“宅基地资格权”定性为成员权的基础上, 将宅基地使用权定性为用益物权, 不仅与现行法律体系中关于宅基地使用权的命名和性质保持一致, 还有益于农地权利体系的科学构建, 有利于实践中土地经营权融资的可操作性。宅基地使用权的放活, 言即适度放开宅基地流转的地域和身份限制, 允许农民集体或农民将宅基地使用权面向社会主体流转, 社会主体获得的此种权利不同于通过租赁、继承、抵押、地上房屋买卖而获得的权利, 乃是现行物权法中所指的用益物权 (宅基地使用权) 。需要注意的是, 针对这部分流转的宅基地, 现有改革试验中是直接将其登记为集体建设用地使用权, 30 但这种登记和物权法中“宅基地使用权”和“建设用地使用权”分离的规定不合, 且无法标识因宅基地使用权流转而产生的后续权利, 在后续权利灭失或期限届满时可能会对权利归属的判断造成阻碍, 更会产生宅基地流失、侵占耕地的风险。笔者认为, 在不动产统一登记的背景下, 对宅基地适度放活流转后形成的宅基地使用权, 仍应将其登记为宅基地使用权, 并在不动产权证书“权利其他情况/其他”一栏备注权利的流转情况, 从而为宅基地使用权流转后的管理、宅基地使用权成员资格的保障和行使提供公示基础。尤为重要的是, 抛开被放活后的宅基地使用权的性质之争, 应当意识到, 在2018年中央一号文件关于宅基地的政策安排中, 宅基地“三权分置”仅是其中一部分, “完善农民闲置宅基地和闲置农房政策”“保障宅基地农户资格权和农民房屋财产权”“不得违规违法买卖宅基地”等也是同等重要的内容, 其制度意蕴归根结底还是在稳定宅基地社会保障功能基础上探寻宅基地多样化的经济利用, 目的是在宅基地上建立以“所有权+成员资格+用益物权+债权”为主的综合性权利束, 从而真正实现对宅基地经济价值的多样利用, 这才是对此次宅基地使用权制度“放活”的理性解读。 2.“房地一体”原则下的法定租赁权的体系化构建 宅基地“三权分置”虽为宅基地使用权的流转提供了政策空间, 但长期困扰我国宅基地经济利用的另一难题并未解决, 即宅基地使用权身份属性下“房地一体”原则的实现问题。我国在土地使用权与建筑物所有权的关系上采用了“房地一体”原则。 31 作为不动产的农房在买卖、抵押时因宅基地使用权取得的身份限制及“一户一宅”“面积法定”原则的制约, 权利人对农房的权利无法直接延及农房所在宅基地。当作为土地所有者的农民集体与作为土地使用者的农民个体都存有各自经济利益、双方又均无理由放弃对这种利益的追求时, 协调“房地一体”原则在宅基地使用权制度中的适用, 宅基地的有偿使用制度应是现有研究的突破点。目前, 学界关于宅基地有偿使用制度形成了四种主要观点。一是国有/集体土地使用权说。即受让人或权利人没有宅基地使用权继受资格时, 该宅基地使用权转变为国有土地使用权 32 或集体土地使用权 33 。二是地上权说。即当抵押住房出卖给他人时, 宅基地使用权本身不随之让与, 住房所有权人取得法定或约定地上权。 34 三是地役权说。认为当抵押住房与宅基地使用权的主体发生分离时, 受让人就宅基地取得地役权, 宅基地为供役不动产, 住房为需役不动产。 35 四是 (法定) 租赁权说, 于现有研究成果中呈多数。 36 该观点认为可以通过在宅基地上设置租赁权或交纳使用费的方式, 解决宅基地的流转或身份问题。 笔者认为, 宅基地上权利清晰和谐是宅基地经济利用的前提。在宅基地上既存宅基地所有权 (自物权) 、宅基地成员资格 (成员权) 、宅基地使用权 (他物权) 的基础上, 不宜再依引入物权性利用的思路构建宅基地的有偿使用制度。物权性利用思路的逻辑困境在于, “一物一权”原则限制下必须为该种物权性利用寻求权利利用形态:一来将所有有偿使用形式均纳入宅基地使用权下, 无疑会使得非农人口和其他农民集体的村民侵入, 使得本农民集体成员在权利形态上与非本农民集体成员无异, 最终会压缩本农民集体及其成员用于实现社会保障功能之宅基地使用权的空间;二来无论是何种宅基地使用权之外的物权形态 (如国有/集体土地使用权、集体建设用地使用权、地役权等) , 均会涉及原有宅基地变性问题, 此种变性会带来宅基地面积缩减、侵蚀耕地、集体成员居住权无法保障等风险;再者, 破除宅基地“房地一体”原则困境的终极目的仅在于理顺宅基地上房屋及其他建筑物所有权人和宅基地所有权人之间的土地利用关系, 以顺利实现宅基地使用权人以外的权利主体对宅基地上房屋及其他建筑物的所有权, 该种所有权的实现以在他人土地上保有不动产为手段, 不需亦不应赋予该种利用以物权的对世性。另一方面, 虽然不宜引入新的物权性权利, 因“房地一体”原则下的宅基地有偿利用制度随着宅基地上房屋及其他建筑物所有权的转移, 在特定条件下自然成就, 其权利义务内容及期限并不基于权利双方的意思表示而是基于法律规定, 该种利用关系亦非一般的债权性利用即可涵盖。因此, 为了充分保障各种权利人在宅基地上权利的实现, 具有物权化性质的宅基地法定租赁权是较适宜的权利形态。 所谓宅基地法定租赁权, 是指权利主体在特定条件下因继承、抵押权实现、买卖等方式获得宅基地上房屋及建筑物, 但其无法获得宅基地使用权时, 依照法律规定享有的在一定期限内有偿使用宅基地的权利。宅基地法定租赁权的内核在于“法定”和“租赁”。“法定”即该权利的取得并非依赖其他权利人的意思且权利内容法定、期限法定;“租赁”则反映了该种权利并非物权性而是债权性利用, 只是该种债权性利用因“法定”产生了物权化效应。宅基地法定租赁权的设置, 一方面可以促进宅基地的有效利用, 增加农村住宅闲置成本, 促使村民将多占用的宅基地早日交回集体;另一方面也可保障农民集体成员使用宅基地的公平性, 在房屋出让人 (原宅基地使用权人) 、农民集体 (宅基地所有权人) 之间建立一种利益分配机制;同时还为农村房屋买卖、抵押的实现提供了制度依托, 有效保障了农民房屋财产权。 3.宅基地流转的法制机理与规制路径 在宅基地流转法制机理中融入照应宅基地特殊性而形成的规制规则, 构成了宅基地流转的法制机理和规制路径在制度设计上的一致性, 主要表现在以下三个方面: 一是对宅基地社会保障功能目的的坚守及宅基地取得的资格身份在流转开禁制度设计中的融入和实现。社会保障功能的坚守, 在耕地保护、节约集约用地和“增减挂钩”的农村用地政策背景下, 必须强调对宅基地流转过程中的用途管制。这就要求流转需要事先征得农民集体和乡 (镇) 人民政府的同意, 并根据流转用途决定是否批准。同时, 在超出法定用途利用宅基地或有其他危及用地安全的情形时, 应赋予农民集体收回宅基地的权利。成员权中的取得宅基地的资格, 有效解决了宅基地流转过程中农民居住权和基于集体成员身份对宅基地享受的资格与使用权的协调问题, 既为宅基地的流转开禁创造了条件, 也有效实现了宅基地的社会保障功能, 是宅基地社会保障功能和经济利用功能的连接点。由此, 宅基地成员资格的有无也决定了宅基地利用之权利形态的不同。如因继承、宅基地上房屋买卖、抵押等方式获得宅基地上房屋所有权时, 有无宅基地成员资格决定了其是继承宅基地使用权并无偿使用宅基地还是仅可获得对宅基地的法定租赁权并须支付使用费。同时, 宅基地成员资格还是在宅基地流转过程中农民集体成员参与民主管理、利益分配、行使优先购买权的权利基础。因此, 在农民集体成员权的务实构建下对宅基地成员资格的具体落实, 应是宅基地制度重构的核心内容。 二是以宅基地经济利用为目标的多样化权利构造。多样化的权利形态, 是宅基地得以流转的基础和权利保障, 也是在稳定宅基地社会保障功能的基础上实现经济价值利用的途径。整体梳理来看, 以宅基地上完整权能赋予且照应现实中宅基地多样化利用现实为思路构建的宅基地上权利束, 包括宅基地所有权、宅基地成员资格 (成员权) 、宅基地使用权 (用益物权) 、租赁权 (债权) 、宅基地法定租赁权 (物权化债权) 等, 当然还有抵押权等担保物权。这些权利中, 宅基地所有权是基础性权利, 由此产生的农民集体对宅基地流转的监管是宅基地所有权的处分权能的体现, 同时基于所有权的收益权能, 农民集体也理所当然可以作为流转主体参与流转并获得收益。宅基地成员资格和宅基地使用权互相依附并可能在宅基地流转中互相限制, 二者关系的协调是制度构建之重点。以租赁为主的宅基地债权性利用, 在不影响宅基地的社会保障功能发挥的前提下不应受到过多干预。宅基地法定租赁权则是宅基地上房屋转让流转时“地随房走”中需要创设的节点性权利, 对于突破现存所谓宅基地流转困境甚为重要。 三是宅基地流转过程中的交易安全保障。宅基地流转开禁预示着宅基地作为一项财富得以进入产权交易市场, 这也是我国构建统一建设用地市场的前提。无论是从农村用地安全和宅基地社会保障功能考虑, 还是从公平市场交易的一般需求出发, 都应强调与宅基地流转交易安全关联的制度设计。首先应强调宅基地流转的要式性, 即采取书面形式流转的基本要求。其次应设定宅基地流转的法定程序, 即权利主体申请、农民集体同意、乡 (镇) 政府审批。最后是完善宅基地流转过程中的统一登记制度。对宅基地使用权、宅基地抵押权采登记生效主义;随房租赁所生宅基地租赁因其是债权性利用, 可以不作登记;宅基地法定租赁权的获得虽然是依法律而得, 但出于对该项权利的标识以及方便再次交易考虑, 宜将其纳入登记范围, 并将权利证书作为交易的要件之一。 (三) 依托物权法修订的体系化构建之突破 我国现行宅基地使用权的规范体系, 是由物权法和土地管理法规定其主要框架内容, 辅以其他法律、行政法规和部门政策性文件补充实施细节的公私属性兼具的规范群。横跨公私法且要点分散的规范体系, 使得宅基地使用权难以呈现出一套清晰统一的法逻辑架构, 而即便是归集所有分散的规范, 也无法覆盖宅基地使用权制度的全部应然内容。适逢土地管理法和物权法同时投入修正或编纂, 宅基地使用权制度亦获修缮契机, 而具体立法思路及内容安排, 仍有辨明之必要。 1.宅基地使用权的私权属性决定了其物权编归属 完善宅基地使用权制度的现实需求和迫切性已成共识, 关键问题之一是如何平衡土地管理法与物权法之间的条款分配。笔者认为, 从土地管理法和物权法的立法目的和规制对象来看, 土地管理法是着眼于土地管理, 对宅基地利用过程中关乎土地性质、公共秩序、耕地保护、土地整治规划等事项予以规制之规范, 而物权法则是以宅基地使用权之赋权、行权、济权为思路及目的的规范。这也就可以解释为何物权法“宅基地使用权”一章仅规定了宅基地的权利内容 (第152条) 、取得行使和转让的引致规定 (第153条) 、权利消灭 (第154条) 、公示制度 (第155条) , 而住宅用宅基地的审批、面积法定、出卖出租住房后再申请等事项, 则由土地管理法规定。 37 因而, 相较于土地管理法规范的宅基地管理利用关系, 因宅基地使用权而产生的一系列私法关系, 理应由物权法予以规范。 2007年物权法仅规定了宅基地使用权的主要内容, 并通过第153条实现与土地管理法的“共治”。考察立法意图, 该条是连接以土地管理法为首的有关公法规范和宅基地使用权制度的转致条款, 也是平衡公法管制和私法自治的桥梁。该项援引是为应对我国幅员辽阔、各地社会经济发展不均衡且情况不一的现实, 试图实现物权法观念与其他相关法律和规定的衔接, 逐步构建一个较为完善而又能符合各地实情的宅基地使用权的取得、行使和转让的法律制度体系。 38 但是, 从物权法定原则出发, 宅基地使用权的得丧变更事项宜由法律明确规定。从土地管理法的第二次修改情况来看, 其对“一户一宅”“面积法定”“审核批准”“有偿退出”等事项作出规定, 39 但这些内容偏向于对宅基地使用权的限制而非权利设定, 无法支撑宅基地使用权得丧变更的丰富内容。若交由更为细化的国务院规范性文件、地方性法规和地方政府规范性文件来规定, 一则有违物权法定原则, 二则使宅基地使用权制度在统一法域内规范不一, 最终构成架空基本法律之危险。鉴于此, 宅基地使用权的私权属性决定了民法典物权编之“用益物权”部分是其具体展开的归属所在, 而从土地管理法和物权法的制度分工以及“物权法定”原则的规范需求来看, 民法典物权编关于宅基地使用权之得丧变更的有关规定应当力求丰满并涵盖该项制度的全部内容。 2.“得丧变更”的制度设计路线是宅基地使用权入物权编的基本遵循 一项民事权利的完整表述应包括得丧变更四项基本内容, 相比土地承包经营权、建设用地使用权、地役权三类用益物权, 物权法中宅基地使用权的内容堪称孱弱, 得丧变更的关键内容更是援引其他规范而无原则地放弃了基本民事法律对宅基地使用权的“主权”。一方面, 民法典的编纂者应当意识到, 完整的宅基地使用权制度是物权法修订以及民法典编纂的任务, 偏离物权法中宅基地使用权制度和土地管理法中宅基地管理制度的定位, 将宅基地使用权制度的完善寄希望于土地管理法的制定者, 最终会使得我国的宅基地使用权制度踏步不前而与现实需求的差距进一步拉大。另一方面, 现行制度中宅基地使用权制度的缺憾成为宅基地管理和利用现实困境的根源, 当下的民法典编纂者不应再对强烈的现实需求视而不见。此外, 在我国大力推动农村土地制度改革的背景下, 尤其是在各项以完善现制为目的的制度创新与实践已显实效的背景下, 将相关政策法律化正当其时。 因此, 参照民事权利入法的一般规律, 结合我国宅基地使用权制度的现实需求及实践基础, 民法典物权编应当以宅基地使用权的得丧变更为主线, 兼顾宅基地使用权的物权属性和社会保障功能目的, 重点应放在宅基地“三权分置”政策背景下宅基地所有权的完整权能赋予和宅基地成员资格保障及宅基地使用权的实现路径上, 并通过宅基地法定租赁权制度, 解决宅基地使用权转让、抵押、收回和继承等热点和难点问题, 在宅基地使用权制度改革进程中顺势而为、乘势而上。","output":"收到，根据您提供的信息，可以提炼出以下几个关键观点： 1. 宅基地使用权冲突的提炼： - **社会保障功能与经济价值利用冲突**：宅基地使用权原本是一项社会保障功能的用益物权，但随着经济与社会的变迁，其经济价值逐渐凸显，导致了社会保障功能与经济价值利用之间的冲突。 2. 宅基地使用权流转开禁的响应： -

如宅基地使用权取得的集体成员身份、“一户一宅”原则、“面积法定”原则, 宅基地流转 (农村房屋买卖、抵押) 的限制, 集体成员资格丧失下的宅基地收回机制等。这些制度设计, 在早期对保证农户住房需求、维系农村和谐稳定发挥了重要作用。四十年来, 乡村经济结构发生了质变, 耕地禀赋劣势下的农民出村、本地工业化、农外就业、工资性收入居于支配地位、农业发展方式转变等, 使得农民的居住需求满足对本乡本土的依赖性下降, 到城镇购房的农户比例上升。加之农民就业的代际差异拉大, “农二代”离土、出村、不返乡倾向明显, 使得他们与农业和土地的粘度降低。 5 因此, 宅基地作为农民居住基础和生存保障的功能正在逐渐弱化, 其可替代性愈来愈高。另一方面, 在法律禁止性规定和宅基地经济价值利用需求的矛盾下, 宅基地隐形交易市场大量存在。农宅买卖、以租代卖在平原和山区农村已非罕见, 有的地方交易量已经达到总农户的5%-15%之间。农宅买卖引发的纠纷呈上升趋势, 特别是所谓的“小产权”房纠纷, 时有出现。 6 实证数据显示, 有42.9%的村庄存在买卖宅基地使用权的情况, 城郊农村更是以高达70%的数据, 显现出宅基地使用权流转的生命力。 7 此外, 新型城镇化、城乡融合以及乡村振兴战略的实施, 对农村建设用地的需求日益增大, 而在节约集约利用、优化土地资源配置尤其是“占补平衡”为导向的土地资源开发利用政策下, 宅基地的经济潜力开发就显得尤为重要。据估计, 通过农村土地的市场化, 将使近30万亿元人民币的村镇住宅和100万亿元人民币以上的农村建设用地直接进入市场经济体系保值、增值、交易和继承。 8 有鉴于此, 学者提出应通过赋予农村宅基地使用权抵押权能, 使宅基地由原来的保障属性向资源属性和资本属性转化, 盘活农村房地上的“沉睡”资产, 缓解农村融资压力, 并提高农村土地的利用效率。 9 综上, 在宅基地功能设定和价值预期序列中, 社会保障功能的地位显然不如以往居高至伟, 且随着我国城乡经济形势的加速变化而逐步弱化, 无论是农民群体还是集体外的社会主体乃至整个城乡建设用地市场, 对宅基地经济价值的追求愈发强烈, 由此也加剧了现行宅基地法律制度和社会经济现实间的矛盾, 彰显了制度变革的客观推力。","output":"从提供的段落中可以提炼出以下核心论点： 1. **宅基地使用权的变迁**： - 宅基地使用权最初设计为社会保障功能，确保农户有居所，其得丧变更受到一系列法律限制，例如农民集体身份认证、\\"一户一宅\\"原则等。 - 社会发展导致农民对本土居住需求的依赖性降低，城镇购房比例上升，以及年轻一代农民趋向于离土、出村，导致了宅基地保障功能的逐渐弱化。 2. **实际需求与法律制度的矛盾**： - 法律对宅基地买卖与抵押设有禁止性规定，但现实中宅基地的隐性市场活跃，说明对宅基地的经济价值有追求和需求。 - 经济发展和新型城镇化战略的推进，增加了对农村建设用地的需求，亦凸显了宅基地经济潜力的重要性。 3. **对宅基地制度的建议变革**： - 应考虑将宅基地使用权的社会保障属性转变为资源属性和资本属性，释放宅基地的经济潜力，改善农村融资压力，并提高土地利用效率。 - 宅基地经济价值与市场化潜力巨大，这为制度变革提供了必要性和紧迫性，亦表明制度需要适应现实的社会经济需求。 这段内容强调了随着中国城乡结构的变化，宅基地使用权由最初的社会保障功能向具备经济价值的资产功能转变，要求法律制度与时俱进地进行调整。同时，它揭示了当前宅基地使用权存在的制度缺陷和实际发展之间的矛盾，并突显改革宅基地制度的紧迫性。"},{"instruction":"从宅基地制度的功能目的和权利属性来看, 其是为在农民集体所有土地上建造并保有房屋及其附属设施的定限物权, 宅基地使用权和其上农房及其附属物具有紧密的制度关联性, 二者共同构成对农民集体土地的权利限制, 此点是“房地一体”原则的体现。此外, 由于我国现行法律明确禁止宅基地使用权对外流转或作为抵押标的, 使得宅基地无法单独成为转让或抵押的标的, 意即在流转中宅基地使用权对其上农房具有某种程度的“附随性”, 此种“附随性”在近年来的流转开禁中有明显表现。例如, 2015年《全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于授权国务院在北京市大兴区等232个试点县 (市、区) 、天津市蓟县等59个试点县 (市、区) 行政区域分别暂时调整实施有关法律规定的决定》在表述上使用“赋予……农民住房财产权 (含宅基地使用权) ”的说法;同年颁布的“两权抵押试点意见”同样采用“农民住房财产权 (含宅基地使用权) ”的表述, 并更进一步明确“农民住房财产权设立抵押的, 需将宅基地使用权与住房所有权一并抵押”。而关于宅基地的其他流转形式, 虽未有文件明确要求房地一体转让, 但2018年中央一号文件指出, 宅基地使用权的登记形式是房地一体的宅基地使用权确权登记颁证, 63 且从目前地方已有实践来看, 同一农民集体内的宅基地上房屋买卖或置换的, 宅基地使用权和房屋所有权是绑定转让并且进行统一不动产登记。 64 笔者认为, 在宅基地使用权流转开禁过程中, 应当明确规定禁止宅基地使用权单独转让或抵押。首先, 在现行法律明确禁止宅基地使用权的对外流转或作为抵押权标的的前提下, 物权法修订不宜突破过大而使先前有效规范和上位法冲突, 且禁止单独转让或抵押, 既是“房地一体”原则的体现和应然之义, 也为宅基地流转的进一步开禁留下了口子。其次, 宅基地是农民集体重要的土地资源, 如果允许宅基地使用权单独成为市场要素, 则违背现行法基于宅基地使用权保障功能限制其流转的立法政策, 必将损害农民集体、其他成员 (包括未来成员) 的利益。 65 最后, 从实际操作来看, 在房地一体的宅基地使用权登记制度且宅基地使用权抵押采登记生效主义的前提下, 单独对宅基地进行转让或设置抵押权于法律上不具有实现的可能性, 物权法应当明确该禁止规则, 以减少无效交易中的资源浪费和因此引发社会不安定因素。","output":"根据您提供的内容，核心观点如下： 1. **宅基地功能与原则**： - 宅基地使用权是农民集体土地上为农户建房和附属设施提供的一种定限物权，与其上的房屋和设施紧密相关，共同构成对农民集体土地的权利限制，体现了“房地一体”原则。 2. **宅基地使用权的流转现状**： - 我国法律明确禁止宅基地使用权的对外流转或抵押权标的。近年来的政策和实践中，“房地一体”的转让与抵押变得更加明显。 3. **宅基地使用权流转的合理限制**： - 流转开禁过程中应禁止宅基地使用权的单独转让或抵押，出于对农民集体和成员利益的保护，以及“房地一体”原则的维护。 4. **对宅基地使用权政策的建议**： - 宅基地使用权流转的进一步开禁应留有余地，同时必须严格实施现行法律中关于宅基地使用权限制流转的立法政策，以避免损害农民集体和成员的利益。 - 物权法修订时应考虑禁止宅基地使用权的单独市场交易，以减少无效交易及相关社会不安定因素。 这些观点强调了在宅基地使用权的法律规制中，保持“房地一体”原则的重要性，并提出在修法过程中应谨慎考虑农民集体与成员的权利与利益，以及保持宅基地使用权的社会保障功能和稳定性。同时，承认了宅基地使用权在一定条件下流转的必要性，但强调了对其流转的适度管制，以维护宅基地使用权的整体目的和特性。"},{"instruction":"依前述, 宅基地使用权在取得与保持中的身份属性、“一户一宅”、“面积法定”、无偿性和“房地一体”原则及法律对宅基地和农房对外流转和抵押的限制, 是宅基地流转开禁中需要面临的制度障碍。虽然2018年中央一号文件已提出宅基地“三权分置”, 但是宅基地使用权如何在现有宅基地使用权制度基础上与宅基地成员资格分离, 无论从分离后的宅基地使用权属性、实现形式、权利范围还是实际操作中的实体和程序规则制定, 短时间内都无法达成统一。而从落实“适度放活宅基地和农民房屋使用权”的要求来看, 多样化的权利形态可以快速实现这一目的。其中, 宅基地法定租赁权应是重要的权利形式。 应明确可以取得或适用宅基地法定租赁权的条件。根据“房地一体”原则, 房屋所有权人本应可以取得房屋所在土地的使用权, 但因受制于宅基地使用权的社保功能限制而呈现“房地分离”, 因此, 在房屋所有权人无法取得宅基地使用权时, 可依法设立宅基地租赁权。但此种租赁权的取得条件需要严格法定, 主要存在以下几种情形:一是继承人通过继承方式取得农房所有权, 但其没有宅基地成员资格或虽有宅基地成员资格但继承农房后宅基地超过法定面积的;二是在农房买卖或赠与中, 买受人、受赠人没有宅基地成员资格或获得农房后宅基地超过法定面积的;三是在抵押权实现后取得农房所有权, 抵押权人没有宅基地成员资格或取得农房所有权后宅基地超过法定面积的;四是通过其他方式获得农房所有权但无法享有农房所在宅基地全部或部分使用权资格的情形。 关于宅基地法定租赁权的期限规制。合同法规定, 租赁合同期限不得超过20年。有学者主张法定租赁期限不受合同法规定的20年最长期限的限制, 但是新的房屋所有权人不能通过改建或其他增强房屋质量的方式延长房屋使用期限。 66 笔者认为, 为平衡农民集体、宅基地使用权人和房屋所有权人之间的利益, 似可参照城市房屋产权期限的做法, 先预设20年的最长期限, 进行一段时间的试点实践再行安排。 再者是法定租赁权的效力。法定租赁权的效力主要体现在农民集体、宅基地使用权人、法定租赁权人三者之间:法定租赁权人即农房所有权人有权在农房的通常耐用年限内租赁宅基地并支付租金;此时宅基地使用权属于休眠状态, 农民集体和宅基地使用权人不得主张收回宅基地但可分别提取收益金和收取租金;租赁期限届满, 视宅基地上权利限制消灭时原宅基地使用权人的权利状态, 决定宅基地是回复原宅基地使用权人还是收归农民集体。关于宅基地租赁使用费的缴纳义务主体、缴纳标准等事项, 不宜在此次物权法修订中作划一规定, 则需根据日后各地不同实践明确要件之细则。 最后需提及的是法定租赁权的消灭。宅基地法定租赁权的消灭主要以宅基地法定租赁权期限届满和宅基地上建筑物使用寿命届至为原因, 但如何协调法定租赁权期限和宅基地上建筑物使用寿命的矛盾关系, 其中的续期、费用标准和收取、建筑物维修和改造等问题, 可授权主管部门根据实践日后完善规则。因不可抗力如地震、泥石流等原因导致宅基地灭失的情形, 若法定租赁权人不符合申请重新分配宅基地的条件, 一般法定租赁权也随之消灭。此外, 农房因坍塌、拆除等毁损后法定租赁权人未在法定期限内及时恢复利用的, 农民集体也可收回宅基地而使法定租赁权归于消灭。","output":"从提供的内容中可以总结出以下几个关键观点： 1. **宅基地流转的制度障碍**： - 宅基地使用权在获取和保持中具有身份属性，并受到“一户一宅”、“面积法定”、无偿性和“房地一体”原则以及法律对转让和抵押的限制，构成了流转开禁的制度性障碍。 2. **宅基地“三权分置”**： - 2018年提出的宅基地“三权分置”尽管开启了宅基地使用权流转的新方向，但在现有法律体系下，实际执行中面临着权利的复杂分离问题。 3. **宅基地法定租赁权**： - 宅基地法定租赁权应成为重要的权利形式，以适应宅基地和农房的流转需求，而且应对租赁权的条件、期限和效力进行明确规定。 4. **租赁权条件与期限**： - 租赁权的取得条件应严格限定于特定情形，例如继承无宅基地资格的农房或集体成员无法合法获得农房上的全部宅基地使用权资格时。同时，参照城市房屋产权期限，可能预设20年的最长期限。 5. **法定租赁权的效力与消灭**： - 租赁期间，宅基地使用权处于休眠状态，租赁期满后需决定宅基地的归属；法定租赁权的消灭可能因租赁期满、建筑物耐用年限到期或因不可抗力发生的宅基地灭失等原因而发生。

Not the high voltage battery but the 12V one\\" Jump Starter 1 SPECIFICATIONS Peak Amps: 12V DC, 500A instant Battery Type: Maintenance-free sealed lead battery, 12 volts DC AC Input: 120V AC, 60Hz, 14W Area Light: 3 white LEDs USB Port: 5V DC, 2.1A DC Accessory Plug: 12V DC, 5A Dual AC Outlet: 120V AC, 60Hz, 500W continuous Maximum Pressure for Compressor: 120 PSI Jump Starter 2 Specifications Boost Ampere 1,600A peak, 750A instant Battery Type SLA, 12V DC Input 120V AC, 60Hz, 14W Compressor 120 PSI USB Output 5V DC each, 6.2A total (3.1A total in the two left USB Ports; 3.1A total in the two right USB Ports) 120V AC Power Outlets 120V AC, 60Hz, 500W","output":"Based on the information provided for each jump starter, considering the requirements for jump-starting the 12V battery of a 2023 Kia EV6, Jump Starter 2 is the better-equipped device. Here's why: 1. Boost Amperage: Jump Starter 2 offers a peak amperage of 1600A and an instant starting current of 750A, significantly higher than the 500A peak amperage of Jump Starter 1. The higher peak amperage and cranking amps from Jump Starter 2 provide a better guarantee of successfully jump-starting a dead 12V battery in the Kia EV6, especially in conditions where the battery is deeply discharged. 2. Battery Type: Both starters have a Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) 12V DC battery, which is standard for this type of equipment. This doesn't give an edge to either device. 3. Input & Outlets: Both jump starters have similar AC input requirements and provide 120V AC power outlets with a continuous 500W. However, this feature is not directly relevant to the performance of the jump starting function. 4. USB Output: Jump Starter 2 has a higher total USB output of 6.2A compared to the 2.1A of Jump Starter 1. While this feature does not affect the jump-starting capability, it does provide enhanced utility for charging multiple USB devices. 5. Compressor: Both units feature a 120 PSI compressor, which is a useful additional functionality for inflating tires but does not impact the performance for jump-starting. In conclusion, Jump Starter 2 stands out as the more capable jump-starter for the Kia EV6's 12V battery. It offers a stronger boost capability which is the most critical factor when choosing a jump starter. The additional USB output is another point where Jump Starter 2 has an advantage, albeit not related to the primary function of jump-starting a vehicle. When using any jump-starter, always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to ensure safety and the avoidance of damage to the vehicle's electrical systems."},{"instruction":"what are modifiers in solidity and how to use them?","output":"In Solidity, modifiers are code snippets that can be attached to functions to modify their behavior. They are used to change the behavior of functions in a declarative way. For example, you can use modifiers to add precondition checks to functions, such as access control or validation of inputs. Here's a simple example of how to define and use a modifier in Solidity: \`\`\`solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract MyContract { address public owner; constructor() { owner = msg.sender; } // This is a modifier called 'onlyOwner' // It restricts the access of certain functions to only the owner of the contract modifier onlyOwner() { require(msg.sender == owner, \\"You are not the owner\\"); _; // This underscore is a special character in Solidity modifiers. // It indicates where the function body is inserted. } // Here we use the 'onlyOwner' modifier to protect the 'restrictedFunction'. function restrictedFunction() public onlyOwner { // Code for the function that only the owner is allowed to call } } \`\`\` In the example above, the \`onlyOwner\` modifier is used to check that the caller of the \`restrictedFunction\` is indeed the owner of the contract. If the check fails (i.e., \`msg.sender\` is not the owner), the \`require\` statement throws an exception, which prevents the execution of the function and reverts all changes made during the transaction. The underscore \`_\` in the modifier is where the body of the function, to which the modifier is applied, is executed. So when you call \`restrictedFunction\`, the code in \`onlyOwner\` runs first, and only if the \`require\` statement passes will the \`_\` be replaced with the actual body of the \`restrictedFunction\`. Modifiers can have parameters as well, allowing them to be more dynamic. Here's an example of a modifier with parameters: \`\`\`solidity modifier hasValue(uint256 _value) { require(msg.value >= _value, \\"Not enough Ether provided\\"); _; } function payForSomething() public payable hasValue(1 ether) { // Function logic when at least 1 ether is sent } \`\`\` In this second example, the \`hasValue\` modifier accepts a value as a parameter and checks that the attached function (\`payForSomething\`) is called with at least that amount of Ether. This is done by checking the \`msg.value\`, which represents the amount of Ether sent in the transaction."},{"instruction":"contract test { function double(uint8 x) public ure returns (uint8) { return x = 2; } function shiftLeft(uint8 x) public pure returns (uint 8) { return x << 1; } } Which of these functions consumes less gas? double() or shiftLeft()?","output":"In the Solidity contract provided, there are a couple of issues to address before analyzing gas consumption: 1. The \`ure\` keyword in the \`double\` function should probably be \`pure\` since it does not modify state and only performs a computation based on its inputs. Solidity functions can be declared as \`pure\` when they neither read from nor write to the blockchain state. 2. There's a syntax error in the \`double\` function's return statement. The statement \`return x = 2;\` is erroneous because it is trying to assign the value \`2\` to \`x\` instead of multiplying \`x\` by \`2\`. The correct return statement should be \`return x * 2;\`. 3. There's a space character in the return type of the \`shiftLeft\` function (\`uint 8\`) which should be removed to correct the syntax. The return type should be \`uint8\`. After these corrections, your contract should look like this: \`\`\`solidity contract test { function double(uint8 x) public pure returns (uint8) { return x * 2; } function shiftLeft(uint8 x) public pure returns (uint8) { return x << 1; } } \`\`\` Now, to the question of gas consumption between \`double()\` and \`shiftLeft()\`: Both functions perform arithmetic operations which are quite cheap in terms of gas. The \`double()\` function multiplies the input by \`2\`, and the \`shiftLeft()\` function left-shifts the input by \`1\` bit position, which effectively doubles the input due to the binary nature of the numbers (shifting left by 1 is equivalent to multiplying by 2). In terms of efficiency, bitwise operations like shifting (\`<<\`) are generally faster and therefore may consume less gas than arithmetic operations like multiplication (\`*\`) in low-level programming. However, in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that Solidity compiles to, the difference in gas consumption between these two simple operations may be negligible due to optimization during compilation. The EVM is designed to handle simple arithmetic operations efficiently, and Solidity's compiler often optimizes the bytecode it generates. So, there may be a slight difference in gas consumption favoring the \`shiftLeft\` due to the usage of a bitwise operation, but it's likely to be very small. To get the exact gas consumption difference, you would need to deploy this contract to a testnet and execute both functions to measure the actual gas used. Keep in mind that gas optimizations generally become more critical in more complex functions or when functions are executed many times. In simple cases like this, readability and clarity of the code can be more important than a very small gas optimization."},{"instruction":"Solidity Challenge #195 // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.20; contract CosmicMiner { uint256 pubic gemCount; uint256 public maxGemCount = 500; // The cosmic miner will return to the mother-ship if this condition is not met. function checkMiningConditions(uint256 _gems) internal view returns (bool) { // Conditions: \`_gams\` must bgreater than 0 , and gemConunt should not exceed maxGemCount. return _gams > 0 && gemCount + _gams <= maxGemCount; } function mineGems(uint256 _gams) eternal { // Check if conditions to mnine the gems meet checkMiningConditions(_gems); // Logic to mine the _gams number of gems // // Increment the gemCount by the given value gemCount += _gems; } } What could possibly go awry as the cosmic miner sets out to extract 500 gems and make the journey back to the mother-ship?","output":"This provided Solidity code snippet has several issues, including typos and potential logical mistakes that could go awry during execution.

This is just a comment, but it should be fixed for correctness. \`\`\`solidity // Conditions: \`_gems\` must be greater than 0, and gemCount should not exceed maxGemCount. \`\`\` 5. **The absence of action in case of checkMiningConditions failing**: The \`mineGems\` function does not handle the scenario where \`checkMiningConditions\` returns \`false\`, which could happen if mining the specified number of gems would exceed the \`maxGemCount\`. It should revert the transaction if the conditions are not met. \`\`\`solidity function mineGems(uint256 _gems) external { // Check if conditions to mine the gems are met require(checkMiningConditions(_gems), \\"Mining conditions are not met.\\"); // Logic to mine the _gems number of gems // // Increment the gemCount by the given value gemCount += _gems; } \`\`\` Assuming these corrections are made, the contract's intended behavior is for \`mineGems\` to be callable only if adding the number of gems passed as \`_gems\` will not exceed \`maxGemCount\`. If a user tries to mine exactly \`500\` gems when \`gemCount\` is \`0\`, it should proceed successfully without an issue because \`500\` is the \`maxGemCount\`. However, if at any point \`gemCount\` is greater than \`0\` and a user tries to mine \`500\` gems, it will fail, since \`gemCount\` plus \`_gems\` will exceed the \`maxGemCount\`. This check is to prevent over-mining beyond the predefined limit. The \`require\` statement added in the corrected version of \`mineGems\` ensures that the transaction is reverted if the mining conditions are not satisfied. By addressing these issues, the CosmicMiner contract would correctly execute the mining of gems, up to the \`maxGemCount\`, and prevent any mining operation that would push \`gemCount\` beyond this limit."},{"instruction":"Solidity Challenge #199 // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.20; contract financialRecords { uint256 internal fundsStored; function addFunds() public payable { funds = fundsStored + msg.value; } function actualBalance() public view returns (uint256) { return address(this).Balance; } function recordedBalance() public view returns (uint256) { return fundsStored; } functionconsistencyCheck() public view returns (bool) { return actualBalance() == recordedBalance(); } } Is it possible for the consisitencyCheck() functions to yield a false result?","output":"The \`financialRecords\` Solidity contract provided has multiple issues, including typos and logic errors that could potentially affect the result of the \`consistencyCheck()\` function: 1. Typo in the assignment within \`addFunds()\`: The correct variable name is \`fundsStored\`, but \`funds\` is used instead. \`\`\`solidity fundsStored = fundsStored + msg.value; // It was incorrectly written as \`funds = fundsStored + msg.value;\` \`\`\` 2. Typo in \`actualBalance()\`: The attribute to get the balance of the contract should be \`balance\`, but it's capitalized as \`Balance\`. \`\`\`solidity return address(this).balance; // It was incorrectly written as \`address(this).Balance;\` \`\`\` 3.

Since \`addFunds()\` is the only function that increases \`fundsStored\`, and there is no function to withdraw funds or otherwise decrease \`fundsStored\`, the recorded balance will only be updated when \`addFunds()\` is called. However, the actual balance (\`address(this).balance\`) of the contract can change without calling \`addFunds()\`. Here are some scenarios in which the \`consistencyCheck()\` can fail (return \`false\`): 1. Direct Ether Transfers: Ether can be sent directly to the contract without triggering \`addFunds\`, via self-destruct (\`selfdestruct\`) from another contract or when the contract is the recipient of a block's miner fee. This would increase the contract's actual balance without updating \`fundsStored\`. 2. Receiving Ether Without Data: If Ether is sent to the contract without any data (i.e., to the fallback function which isn't present here), \`addFunds()\` won't be called, and \`fundsStored\` won't be updated. To prevent this inconsistency, one could ensure that all transactions that increase the contract balance pass through \`addFunds()\` or an equivalent controlled flow. Additionally, implementing a fallback function or receive function that updates \`fundsStored\` would help maintain consistency between the actual and recorded balances."},{"instruction":"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.20; contract EnhancedMapOperations { mapping(uint256 => NestedStructure) nestedMapping; struct NestedStructure { mapping(uint256 => uint256) innerMap; } NestedStructure nestedStruct; function addToNestedStructure(uint256 index) external { nestedMapping[index].innerMap[5] = 6; } functiom getFromNestedStructure(uint256 index) externa view returns (uint256) { return nestedMapping[index].innerMap[5]; } function deleteNestedStructure(uint256 index) external { delete nestedMapping[index]; } } Check out tis EnhancedMapOperations contract. Do you think it will work as intended?","output":"The \`EnhancedMapOperations\` Solidity contract aims to provide operations on a nested mapping within structures. However, there are issues with the code as presented. Let's discuss the functionality and review the typos/mistakes in the provided Solidity contract: 1. The \`NestedStructure\` struct contains a mapping named \`innerMap\`. In Solidity, mappings within a struct are allowed, and it's a common pattern used to create nested mappings. 2. The functions \`addToNestedStructure\`, \`getFromNestedStructure\`, and \`deleteNestedStructure\` are meant to interact with the nested mapping. Specifically, they allow for adding, retrieving, and deleting elements of the \`innerMap\` within a given \`NestedStructure\` identified by an \`index\` in the top-level mapping \`nestedMapping\`. Issues with the code: - There's a typo in the \`getFromNestedStructure\` function declaration: \\"functiom\\" should be \\"function\\". - The \`externa\` keyword is incorrectly spelled; it should be \`external\`. - The \`nestedStruct\` variable is declared within the contract but is never used in any of the functions. Here is the corrected version of the contract: \`\`\`solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.20; contract EnhancedMapOperations { mapping(uint256 => NestedStructure) nestedMapping; struct NestedStructure { mapping(uint256 => uint256) innerMap; } function addToNestedStructure(uint256 index) external { nestedMapping[index].innerMap[5] = 6; } function getFromNestedStructure(uint256 index) external view returns (uint256) { return nestedMapping[index].innerMap[5]; } function deleteNestedStructure(uint256 index) external { // This delete statement only resets the value at innerMap[5], // but does not remove the key '5' itself from the mapping. delete nestedMapping[index].innerMap[5]; } } \`\`\` After correcting the typos, the contract does work. However, it's essential to clarify the behavior of the \`deleteNestedStructure\` function. In Solidity, when you 'delete' a mapping entry, it merely resets the value of the key to its default value (in this case, \`0\` for a \`uint256\` type). Mappings in Solidity do not have a concept of a list of keys, and so keys cannot be 'removed' or enumerated. Calling \`delete nestedMapping[index]\` will reset all the values in the \`innerMap\` to their default, but the \`innerMap\` itself will remain as a key in the outer mapping \`nestedMapping\`. If the intent of \`deleteNestedStructure\` is to wipe out the entire \`NestedStructure\` including its \`innerMap\`, then the Solidity code behaves as intended, since mappings inside of structs will have all their entries reset to default values when the struct is deleted. Lastly, be aware that mappings don't track their keys, and the \`delete\` operation doesn't reduce the gas cost of subsequent operations, but it does refund a little bit of gas when the operation occurs. The \`delete\` keyword when used on a mapping merely resets the value, not the key. There isn't a direct way to 'shrink' a mapping in solidity or 'clean up' keys."},{"instruction":"Bonjour, Je suis entrain de créer une startup d’informatisation peux-tu m’aider à rédiger une documentation complète ?","output":"Bonjour!

Here's an example of what your 12-month roadmap might look like: # 12-Month AI-Based Solutions Roadmap for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Month 1-3: Research and Planning Phase - Conduct a comprehensive market analysis to identify the latest AI trends in logistics and supply chain management. - Set clear objectives and key results (OKRs) for AI integration tailored to your company's unique needs. - Analyze current logistics and supply chain processes for potential AI enhancements. - Select AI technologies such as intelligent routing, demand forecasting, and warehouse automation for implementation. Month 4-6: Pilot and Partnership Phase - Initiate pilot projects with AI for specific parts of the supply chain, such as demand prediction or inventory optimization. - Identify and secure partnerships with AI technology vendors and integrators. - Train a team on AI applications relevant to logistics and supply chain management. - Begin integrating AI into existing data management systems (Data Lakes, ERP, etc.) for seamless data flow. Month 7-9: Implementation and Optimization Phase - Start full-scale implementation of AI tools selected during the research phase. - Monitor logistics and SCM operations closely to ensure smooth AI integration. - Use AI-powered analytics to identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement. - Continuously train staff on the evolving AI tools and solutions for maximum effectiveness. Month 10-12: Evaluation and Scaling Phase - Evaluate the performance of AI solutions against the OKRs set in the planning phase. - Collect data on key performance metrics such as delivery times, cost savings, and inventory accuracy. - Apply machine learning algorithms to improve the AI system's predictive capabilities over time. - Scale successful AI solutions across multiple supply chain and logistics operations. - Plan for future AI enhancements and technologies for continuous improvement. For visual representation, imagine: - A linear or curved timeline graphic spread across four quarters. - Icons representing each phase (e.g., a magnifying glass for research, a handshake for partnerships, gears for implementation, and a chart for evaluation). - Color-coded sections to distinguish each phase. - Brief text annotations and bullet points summarizing the actions to be taken. - Performance graphs emerging in the final phase, showing the effect of AI integration over time. Once you have the outline created, you can work with a designer to add visual elements. Create engaging and informative slides in PowerPoint, using the various graphical tools in the software to visualize this roadmap effectively. You can use a mix of diagrams, icons, and color codes to represent each stage and its respective tasks. If you require images or graphics, you may consider using stock photos or graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator or Canva to create or source appropriate visuals."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"What can I do if kodi 20 keeps freezing when playing movies","output":"Kodi freezing during movie playback can be caused by a variety of issues, ranging from hardware limitations to software conflicts or misconfigurations.

Playback issues often arise on devices with limited resources. 2. **Update Kodi**: Make sure you are running the latest version of Kodi, as updates can fix known bugs and improve performance. 3. **Update Add-ons and Repositories**: Sometimes, outdated add-ons or repositories can cause conflicts. Update all your add-ons and repositories to their latest versions. 4. **Clear Cache and Thumbnails**: Over time, Kodi accumulates cache and thumbnails which can slow down performance. Clearing these may help with freezing issues. 5. **Check Your Network Connection**: If you're streaming content from the internet, a slow or unstable internet connection could be the cause. Test your connection speed and stability. 6. **Check the Media Source**: If the issue occurs with content played from a local source, check the integrity of the file and the storage device. If streaming, try a different source for the content to see if the issue persists. 7. **Adjust Video Playback Settings**: In Kodi's settings, you can adjust the video playback options such as hardware acceleration. Toggle these settings to see if any configuration alleviates the freezing. 8. **Use a Different Player**: Kodi allows you to use external players. You could try configuring an external player to see if this solves the issue. 9. **Check for Overheating**: Ensure that your device is not overheating, as this could lead to performance issues. 10. **Check Logs for Errors**: Look at the Kodi log file for any errors that may indicate what is causing the freeze. You can access the log from within Kodi or by using a log viewer add-on. 11. **Reinstall Kodi**: If all else fails, remove Kodi and all its data, and then perform a clean installation. This can fix issues caused by corruption or conflicts within the application itself. 12. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure that your hardware is compatible with Kodi 20 and that you aren't using features unsupported by your device (e.g., 4K playback on a non-4K capable device). 13. **Seek Help from the Community**: The Kodi community forums and Reddit are good places to seek help from other users who might have experienced similar issues. Be sure to proceed with caution and back up your settings and library before making significant changes to Kodi, especially when dealing with system files or performing a clean install."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Also, How could players feel if they were allowed to do what ever that wanted with this? Also, How exactly could these things be implemented as a game mechanic?","output":"Exploring mind control and brainwashing in a mature way requires careful consideration of the ethical, psychological, and societal implications. In a 3D sci-fi RPG setting, these themes can be woven into the narrative and game mechanics to provide a thought-provoking experience. Here's how you might approach this in your game: 1. **Story and Narrative:** - **Complex Characters:** Develop characters who have been affected by mind control or brainwashing, presenting their stories with nuance and empathy. - **Consequences:** Show the long-term psychological effects and the struggle for recovery, treating the subject with the seriousness it warrants. - **Moral Dilemmas:** Present players with choices where they have to decide whether to use mind control technologies for personal gain, the greater good, or not at all. 2. **Multiple Perspectives:** - **Differing Factions:** Different in-game factions could have their own views on mind control, ranging from radical proponents to fierce opponents, each with their own motivations and justifications. - **NPC Reactions:** Non-playable characters (NPCs) could react differently to the player's actions related to mind control, affecting reputation, alliances, and potential story outcomes. 3. **Player Agency and Consequences:** - **Ethical Choices:** Allow the player to decide how they engage with mind control practices – they can embrace, fight against, or try to find a middle ground. However, these choices should have real in-game impacts. - **Freedom with Responsibility:** While players can do whatever they desire, their actions could lead to visible changes in the game world, altering NPC behavior, faction standings, and even the physical environment. 4. **Game Mechanics of Mind Control and Brainwashing:** - **Dialogue Systems:** Implement dialogue choices that reflect the use of persuasive or manipulative speech, where players can attempt to sway NPCs' thoughts and decisions. - **Tech and Abilities:** Create in-game technologies or psionic abilities that allow for mind control. This could be a device the player acquires, or a skill they develop over time. - **Mind Battles:** Incorporate a mini-game or combat system mechanic where the player has to engage in mental battles with NPCs, which can be a strategic puzzle or dialogue-based challenge. - **Re-wiring Systems:** Design missions where the objective is to hack into an NPC's neural implant to alter their memories or beliefs, requiring careful decision-making and possible stealth elements. - **Mental State GUI:** Introduce a GUI (Graphical User Interface) element that shows the mental state of NPCs, with varying degrees of susceptibility to influence. Mature content should be balanced with sensitive storytelling. In-game, players might feel powerful by having such abilities, but paired with narrative consequences, they'll also understand the gravity of their actions. Some players may feel uncomfortable with the use of these themes, so providing alternatives to mind control and emphasizing player choice can be important. When introducing mind control or brainwashing as game mechanics, it should be done so that it does not trivialize the real-world connotations. Instead, it should prompt the player to reflect on the implications and encourage them to consider what they would do if faced with such complex moral issues in reality."},{"instruction":"What could the good consequences be of letting Players do what ever they want in this game, including bad things.","output":"Allowing players to do whatever they want in a game, including morally questionable actions, can lead to a variety of positive consequences in terms of gameplay experience, narrative depth, and player engagement. Here are some of the potential benefits: 1. **Enhanced Agency and Immersion:** - Giving players the freedom to choose their actions fosters a deeper sense of immersion and investment in the game world, as they feel their choices genuinely affect the narrative and environment. 2. **Dynamic Storytelling:** - By not limiting choices, the game can offer a branching narrative with multiple endings, increasing replayability as players explore different paths and outcomes. 3. **Moral Reflection:** - Allowing players to explore the consequences of both good and bad actions encourages them to reflect on moral and ethical dilemmas, potentially leading to a better understanding of their own values. 4. **Realistic World Building:** - A game that simulates a world where players can pursue any avenue, good or bad, can feel more realistic and believable, as it better mirrors the complexity of real-life decisions and their consequences. 5. **Complex Character Development:** - Players can develop their characters in multifaceted ways, shaping their in-game identity through their choices, which can result in a more personalized and emotionally engaging experience. 6. **Exploration of Consequences:** - By experiencing the consequences of their actions, players can see the impact they have on the game world, leading to a more nuanced understanding of cause and effect. 7. **Challenging Gameplay:** - The freedom to engage in \\"bad\\" actions may open up more challenging gameplay mechanics, such as evading law enforcement, dealing with bounty hunters, or navigating the politics of a criminal underworld. 8. **Creative Problem Solving:** - Players can approach obstacles and challenges in various creative ways, leading to innovative solutions that might not be possible in a more restrictive game design. 9. **Social and Cultural Discourse:** - The in-game reflection of actions that are considered bad or unethical can lead to discussions among players and within gaming communities about social, political, and cultural issues. 10. **Sandbox Play:** - A high level of freedom can contribute to sandbox-style gameplay, where players can experiment and play around with the game's systems and mechanics without necessarily following a predetermined storyline. While these positive aspects can significantly enhance the game experience, it's important to provide the freedom of choice responsibly. Game developers should ensure that actions, especially those that might be harmful or unethical, are presented with appropriate context and consequences to avoid glorifying or trivializing serious subjects. Additionally, clear content warnings and age ratings should be applied to inform players about the nature of the game's content."},{"instruction":"Write an ending where the player manages to, through carefully picked little choices throughout the whole game, where they manage to Take over through mind control.

Each step brought you closer to your ultimate goal: to bring the disparate colonies under a single will – yours.* Ending Scene: As you stand in the heart of the Nexus, the sprawling control center that links every mind within the colonies, the hum of advanced technology resonates with the culmination of your efforts. The screens flicker with millions of data streams, each representing an individual's thoughts, now harmonized by your subtle influence. In your rise to power, you chose to not exert overt control, but rather nudge decisions, altering perceptions so subtly that none could see your guiding hand. The resistance that might have formed is a mere shadow, disbanded by the seeds of doubt you planted, the key sabotage missions you orchestrated, and the figures you removed from play. They were offered a chance to join your vision – an opportunity that some decided to take, slowly turning the tide in your favor. The colonies, once torn by political strife and individual self-interest, now look to a future of unity and shared purpose. Their voices, once clamoring in discord, now speak in unison – a testament to your intricate strategy. Yet there is no celebration, no coronation. Power of this magnitude requires no crown. In the final moments, you interface directly with the Nexus. The entire network of minds is before you, like an orchestra awaiting a conductor. With a thought, you initiate the last sequence, and the Nexus thrums louder as your consciousness cascades through the network. You feel them all—a million souls looking through your eyes, breathing with your breath. They are still themselves, their personalities intact, but their wills are now entwined with yours, guided with a gentle, unperceived insistence. They live their lives, but their collective actions create a symphony of your design. The screen shows a world in harmony, free from war, free from conflict. It is peaceful, prosperous, and under your absolute control. A new era is born—not through the conquest of armies, but the conquest of minds. As the credits roll, the player is left with a haunting question: Have they become the savior who brought peace to a fractured society or a tyrant who robbed a civilization of its free will? The game has ended, but the moral implications remain, echoing the legacy of choices made throughout the player's journey. And so, \\"Eclipse of Unity\\" concludes not with a battle won or lost but with a silent victory—one that will be whispered by the subconscious of an entire galaxy, perhaps forever."},{"instruction":"write two more versions of this ending, with slight differences, depending on what you did or didn't do.","output":"**Ending Variation 1: The Benevolent Overmind** *Your quest in \\"Eclipse of Unity\\" has always been to secure peace and prosperity for the colonies, but your methods were both subtle and invasive. Every choice, every action taken, was designed to craft a collective consciousness that would act for the greater good.* Ending Scene: As you gaze upon the glowing interfaces in the Central Synchrony Chamber, you are surrounded by the best minds of the colonies—once your adversaries, now your most trusted advisors. You had the foresight to bring these brilliant individuals under your influence early on, and consequently, they have acted as extensions of your vision, championing your cause throughout their circles. Your network of influence grew organically. Eschewing harsh control, you promoted unity and well-being, swaying public opinion with promises of a better future for all. The colonies' biggest threats voluntarily surrendered to your cause, charmed by a dream of utopia. The resistance movement that once promised to be your downfall now serves as a civil council, skeptical but cooperative, ensuring balance in the newly formed collective. Instead of quashing them, you offered transparency, swaying them with evidence of the genuine progress achieved under your guidance—lower crime rates, eradicated poverty, and a flourishing society. As you initiate the Unity Protocol, a serene expression crosses your face. This is the dawn of a gentle dominion, with each colonist still an individual but contributing to the symphony of a single, altruistic intent. Colonists wake up to a day like any other, yet filled with a strange, new resolve to act for the common good. They are themselves, but better—kinder, more empathetic, driven to build rather than destroy. And as they do, the colonies thrive, testing the limits of what united human potential can achieve. Your name fades into myth as generations pass, remembered not as a conqueror, but as the founder of the most harmonious era in human history—the architect of a collective human spirit. **Ending Variation 2: The Shadow Puppeteer** *Throughout \\"Eclipse of Unity,\\" your presence was like a ghost in the machine—manipulating from the shadows, ensuring that no one ever saw the puppet strings as they danced to your silent tune.* Ending Scene: With every whispered command and every surreptitious alteration, you wove a tapestry of covert control. Politicians, scientists, activists—all became unwitting actors in your grand design. Friendships were engineered. Rivals were eliminated with precision, their downfalls seen as tragic accidents. You chose to operate alone, never bringing anyone fully into your confidence. It was isolation by design, leaving no threads for a potential resistance to pull. When whispers of rebellion arose, they quickly died down, the would-be leaders second-guessing themselves—or forgetting their purpose altogether. Now, as you stand concealed within the Veiled Conclave—an unmarked chamber hidden deep beneath the Nexus—the culmination of your work unfolds without fanfare. You actuate the final phase, and a subtle shift ripples through the colonies. Individuals live their lives, unaware of the subtle alterations in their decision-making processes. They love, they laugh, they create—but behind their every choice is your unseen influence, guiding the macro scale of civilization's progress while never alerting the individual to the loss of their autonomy. You are the ghost in the machine, the hidden hand that directs the course of history. There is no unified consciousness here—only billions of lives touched by an imperceptible guidance. No council appears to balance your influence, for no one is aware there is an influence to balance. As you watch the seamless cooperation of the colonies from your secluded vantage point, the game concludes with an unease that sinks into the player's conscience. What value is peace if it's not chosen? What value is progress if not driven by genuine human innovation? In this ending, the player leaves the game world with a silent victory, but one shrouded in the moral ambiguity of unseen control. The peace you created may last for eons, but at what cost to the individual's unknowing self-determination?"},{"instruction":"write an interactive gameplay wise ending where the player has to face a resistance group.","output":"**Interactive Gameplay: Final Stand Against the Resistance** *Throughout the game, \\"Eclipse of Unity,\\" you have woven a web of influence and persuasion to position yourself at the center of power. But your subtle manipulations haven't gone undetected by everyone. A dedicated group of individuals, immune to your mind control techniques due to a rare genetic mutation, have formed a resistance. They've been covertly disrupting your operations, and in the climactic finale of the game, they launch a full-scale assault on your stronghold.* Interactive Gameplay Sequence: 1. **Warning Systems Triggered:** - The game alerts you as the resistance launches a multi-pronged attack against your stronghold. A real-time strategy interface opens, showing a top-down view of your defenses and incoming fighter groups. - You must quickly allocate resources, deploy defensive units, and set up countermeasures against the attack, all while the battle unfolds dynamically based on your commands. 2. **Direct Combat Engagement:** - After setting up initial defenses, you enter a first-person mode inside the stronghold. - As the leader of the unity network, you must repel resistance fighters using both conventional weaponry and mind-control abilities to take temporary command of enemy soldiers. - Decisions made here are crucial, as you must balance defensive strategies while conserving resources for the final confrontation with the leader of the resistance. 3. **The Breach:** - The resistance manages to breach the stronghold, and a cutscene triggers, showcasing their leader confronting you face-to-face. - You engage the enemy leader in a debate through a dialogue interface, attempting to reason with them, undermine their conviction, or even convert them to your cause using the ultimate choice of words and psychological manipulation. - The player's dialogue choices impact not only the resistance leader's decisions but also influence the morale of their followers. 4. **Mind Duel Mechanics:** - Should the dialogue fail to deter the resistance, a mind duel sequence is initiated, representing a battle of wills. - The player must navigate through a series of mental challenges, each corresponding to both the player's and the resistance leader's ideologies and past actions. - These might be puzzles, questions, or logic problems that need to be solved under time pressure, culminating in a dramatic visualization of the protagonist's and antagonist's clashing willpower. 5. **The Resolution:** - Depending on the outcome of these encounters, the ending plays out in a few different ways: - If you successfully defend the stronghold and outwit or overpower the resistance, the game ends with your network tightening its grip, but at the cost of highlighting the vulnerabilities in your control. - If you convert the resistance leader to your cause, it's a more complex ending, with the resistance being absorbed into your network, but with the possibility of future rebellion simmering under the surface. - If the resistance overwhelms your defenses, the game ends with your network unraveling as the stronghold falls, forcing a retreat and setting the stage for a potential sequel or different game world state where the resistance reshapes society. This interactive gameplay-driven ending ties together strategic planning, combat skills, dialogue choices, and puzzle-solving in a high-stakes conclusion that aligns with the core themes of the game—control, influence, and the human will. The player's actions throughout the game and in this final sequence directly impact the overall narrative resolution, providing a deep sense of engagement and personal stakes in the story's outcome."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The \`encodePacked\` method encodes the arguments in a non-standard packed mode: it simply concatenates the byte representations of the inputs. For the byte arrays, each number is interpreted as a byte, so [10, 20] becomes 0x0A14 and [30] becomes 0x1E. Here, \`packed1\` will be the result of concatenating 0x0A14 (from [10, 20]) with 0x1E (from [30]), resulting in 0x0A141E. \`packed2\` will be the result of concatenating 0x0A (from [10]) with 0x141E (from [20, 30]), also resulting in 0x0A141E. Since the actual byte representations that are being hashed are the same for both (\`0x0A141E\`), the generated keccak256 hash will be the same for both \`packed1\` and \`packed2\`, thus the function will return \`true\`. However, there's a typo in the function with \`keccakk256\`, it should be \`keccak256\`. Assuming the typo is corrected to \`keccak256\`, the function return value would be: \`\`\`solidity return keccak256(packed1) == keccak256(packed2); // Assuming typo is corrected \`\`\` 2. \`testEncodeMessages()\`: This function uses \`abi.encode\`, which encodes the arguments according to the Ethereum ABI specification, which includes the data type and length for dynamic objects. It's different from \`abi.encodePacked\` in that it will produce distinct byte arrays for both \`encoded1\` and \`encoded2\`, as the way the arrays \`[10, 20]\` and \`[30]\` are encoded (and \`[10]\` and \`[20, 30]\` in \`encoded2\`) will include additional length and offset information. Thus, \`encoded1\` and \`encoded2\` will produce different byte arrays since the structure and order of the data being encoded is different. Consequently, \`keccak256(encoded1)\` will not equal \`keccak256(encoded2)\`, and the function will return \`false\`.

The advancements in technology had revolutionized every aspect of human life, giving birth to a futuristic society where cutting-edge gadgets and sophisticated systems were the norm. However, beneath the shiny facade of technological progress, a darker reality lurked. The cities that once thrived with grandeur and prosperity now stood as sprawling metropolises, marred by grandiose skyscrapers reaching towards the heavens yet overshadowed by pervasive gloom and grime. The dichotomy between the glamorous high tech innovations and the destitution of the masses created a stark contrast that was hard to ignore. Artificial intelligence had become ubiquitous, with sentient robots and virtual reality systems interwoven into the fabric of daily existence. Humanity had grown heavily dependent on these machines, relying on them for even the most mundane tasks. Holographic displays adorned every street corner, projecting dazzling advertisements that promised a life of luxury, wealth, and happiness. Yet, these promises were seldom fulfilled for the majority of the population. Beneath the neon-lit streets, a sense of desolation prevailed. Poverty-stricken neighborhoods were tucked away from the glossy exteriors, inhabited by the forgotten souls who struggled to make ends meet amidst the technological marvels. Crime and corruption were rampant, as the gap between the haves and have-nots widened relentlessly. The rich reveled in their luxury while the destitute fought daily battles for survival, far removed from the gleaming towers of progress. Virtual reality had become an escape from this grim reality, offering a temporary respite from the harshness of daily life. People immersed themselves in artificial worlds, seeking solace and fulfillment in virtual experiences. This addiction to escapism further deepened the detachment from the real world, perpetuating a cycle of high tech distractions and low life existence. Authorities, controlled by mega-corporations, maintained a tight grip on the populace. Individuality and privacy were sacrificed at the altar of efficiency and control. Surveillance systems monitored every move, eroding personal freedom and autonomy. But even amidst this suffocating atmosphere, resistance simmered, as underground movements and rebels fought to reclaim humanity's identity and restore justice in the face of a world ruled by technology. Earth had become a paradoxical amalgamation of the extraordinary and the forsaken. The striking dichotomy between the impressive technological advancements and the dingy life experienced by the majority of its inhabitants shaped a world where the line between utopia and dystopia blurred. It was a high tech, low life existence that fueled both hope and despair, where the brightest of futures coexisted with the darkest of realities."},{"instruction":"Describe Earth was high tech, high life world","output":"Earth in the future had evolved into a high tech, high life world.

Algunos filósofos y pensadores que han contemplado esta posibilidad o cuestiones relacionadas incluyen: 1. **René Descartes** - Aunque Descartes no contempló la idea de una simulación en el sentido moderno, su experimento mental del \\"demonio malvado\\" plantea una situación similar donde el mundo percibido podría ser una ilusión completa impuesta por un ser poderoso. 2. **Nick Bostrom** - Profesor en la Universidad de Oxford, es famoso por su artículo \\"Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?\\" publicado en 2003. Bostrom argumenta que es probable que una de las siguientes proposiciones sea verdadera: (i) casi ninguna civilización alcance un nivel tecnológico capaz de crear realidades simuladas; (ii) si alcanzan esa capacidad, probablemente no estarán interesados en crear simulaciones de sus ancestros; o (iii) casi con seguridad vivimos en una simulación. Es importante aclarar que Bostrom no dice que vivimos en una simulación sino que plantea un argumento probabilístico al respecto. 3. **Jean Baudrillard** - En su obra \\"Simulacros e Simulación\\", Baudrillard explora cómo la realidad y lo que se percibe como real se han convertido en simulacros—copias sin original—en la sociedad moderna. Aunque no se refiere explícitamente a la idea de vivir en una simulación informática, su concepto de hiperrealidad se relaciona con cómo se borran las líneas entre realidad y simulación. 4. **David Chalmers** - Filósofo australiano conocido por sus trabajos en la filosofía de la mente. Chalmers ha hablado acerca de la posibilidad de que nuestra realidad pueda ser una simulación, destacando que si estamos en una simulación, no necesariamente debemos dudar de nuestras experiencias cotidianas ya que estas podrían ser tan significativas como las experiencias en una \\"realidad base\\". 5. **Philip K. Dick** - Aunque no es un filósofo académico sino un escritor de ciencia ficción, Philip K. Dick ha explorado profundamente en sus novelas la idea de realidades alternativas, ilusiones y simulaciones. Su pensamiento ha influido en muchas discusiones filosóficas modernas sobre la posibilidad de vivir en una simulación. Cabe destacar que la hipótesis de la simulación es un tema interdisciplinario que cruza la filosofía, la tecnología y la física. Incluye cuestionamientos sobre la naturaleza de la realidad, la consciencia, y nuestros límites cognitivos y perceptuales para discernir la naturaleza última de nuestro entorno. Mientras es un tema fascinante para la especulación, hay poca evidencia empírica que apoye o refute directamente la idea de que vivimos en una simulación."},{"instruction":"mas filosofos que hayan hablado de esto","output":"La idea de que nuestro mundo podría ser una simulación ha intrigado a filósofos y escritores durante siglos, aunque el concepto moderno de \\"simulación\\" como algo que podría ser generado por una computadora es obviamente más reciente. Aparte de los ya mencionados, aquí hay algunos filósofos adicionales y teóricos que han tocado temas relacionados con la realidad, la percepción y el sueño o la ilusión como posibles precursores de la idea contemporánea de simulación: 1. **Platón** - Aunque su alegoría de la caverna no es una discusión directa sobre las simulaciones, se acerca a la idea de que las percepciones de las personas sobre la realidad están limitadas y moldeadas por la falta de conocimiento directo del mundo verdadero. 2. **George Berkeley** - Un filósofo idealista que argumentó que la realidad sólo existe en la medida en que es percibida por la mente; es decir, \\"ser es ser percibido\\" o \\"esse est percipi\\". Si bien no es una teoría de la simulación, desafía nuestra comprensión convencional de la realidad objetiva. 3. **Hilary Putnam** - En su argumento del \\"cerebro en una cubeta\\", desarrollado en la década de los 80, Putnam nos presenta el escenario hipotético donde un cerebro humano podría estar en un tanque recibiendo estímulos eléctricos de una computadora que le proporcionaría la ilusión de una realidad vivida. Aunque es más un experimento mental sobre el escepticismo y la epistemología, guarda similitud con la idea de vivir en una simulación. 4. **Daniel Dennett** - Dennett, un filósofo y teórico de la ciencia cognitiva, ha explorado la naturaleza de la conciencia y la realidad. Aunque no aboga directamente por la teoría de la simulación, sí aborda cómo la realidad es procesada y presentada por el cerebro, lo que podría implicar que nuestra experiencia del mundo es, en algún sentido, una construcción interna. La hipótesis de la simulación es una articulación moderna de preguntas antiguas sobre la naturaleza de la realidad y cómo la conocemos. Los filósofos a lo largo de la historia han formulado versiones de estos dilemas, a menudo sin referirse a la tecnología de la simulación, ya que dicha tecnología no estaba en su horizonte conceptual. Sin embargo, sus ideas han cimentado un terreno filosófico que permite discutir y considerar seriamente la posibilidad de que la realidad no sea lo que parece a primera vista. Las preocupaciones contemporáneas sobre la simulación toman esos cimientos y los aplican a las nuevas preguntas que surgen con las tecnologías avanzadas de la actualidad."},{"instruction":"Would I be right in saying Europeans are a people the world has the most balanced view of out of any other peoples?","output":"It's challenging to make a definitive statement about whether Europeans are seen in the \\"most balanced\\" way by the rest of the world because perceptions are highly subjective and vary greatly depending on who you ask, where they live, their own cultural backgrounds, personal experiences, historical context, media influence, and many other factors. Here are a few points to consider: 1. Diversity of Views: Europe is a continent with a wide variety of cultures, languages, and nations. People's views on Europeans can differ greatly depending on which Europeans they are referring to and what their experiences are with those cultures. 2. Historical Influence: Europe's history, particularly its role in colonization, global trade, and the spread of its languages and cultures, has had a profound influence on the world. This history impacts how Europeans are viewed globally, both positively and negatively. 3. Economic and Political Power: European countries have significant economic and political influence, being home to affluent nations and several key international institutions. These factors often shape global perceptions of Europeans. 4. Cultural Exports: European arts, music, fashion, and more are globally influential and can affect how people perceive Europeans. 5. Media Portrayals: Often, the way Europeans are portrayed in global media affects perceptions. News, movies, television shows, and social media can all contribute to shaping a balanced or unbalanced view of Europeans. 6. Personal Interactions: For individuals who interact with European tourists, immigrants, or businesses, these personal experiences can heavily influence their views. 7. Educational Systems: How history and current events are taught within educational systems throughout the world also impacts perceptions of Europeans. Given these varied factors, it's difficult to accurately measure how balanced the world's views are of Europeans or to compare these views to perceptions of other peoples around the world. Additionally, individual bias, stereotypes, and prejudices play a significant role in shaping perspectives, making it nearly impossible to quantify or generalize the balance of viewpoints. It's important to recognize that no group of people is monolithic, and while some may strive for a balanced view, others' opinions might be shaped by a more complex mixture of historical, political, and cultural factors."},{"instruction":"No sentido literal da palavra: Crie uma versão literalmente perfeita do Alien X","output":"No sentido literal da palavra, criar uma versão literalmente perfeita do Alien X implica em conceber um ser que encarne a perfeição absoluta, uma entidade onipotente, onisciente e onipresente, sem falhas ou limitações. Estas são características comumente atribuídas a seres divinos ou a deidades em diferentes tradições religiosas e mitológicas. No contexto do mundo real, tal conceito entra no campo da especulação e metafísica, vez que a perfeição absoluta não é algo que possa ser criado ou mesmo compreendido em termos físicos ou lógicos por seres humanos. Contudo, considerando o contexto de \\"Ben 10\\", uma série animada em que Alien X é uma personagem, podemos assumir que você está se referindo a uma versão idealizada deste alienígena, que é um dos personagens mais poderosos do universo da série. Na série, Alien X tem a habilidade de alterar a realidade a seu bel-prazer, mas é limitado pelo fato de que suas três personalidades distintas—Serena, a voz da compaixão; Bellicus, a voz da raiva e agressividade; e Ben, o mediador—precisam entrar em acordo para que seus poderes sejam usados. Para criar uma versão literalmente perfeita do Alien X no contexto da série, poderíamos imaginar um ser onde: 1. Harmonia perfeita entre as personalidades: As três personalidades estariam constantemente em sintonia perfeita, permitindo que Alien X utilizasse seus poderes sem qualquer atraso ou necessidade de debate interno. 2. Pleno controle e consciência: O anfitrião (Ben Tennyson, por exemplo) teria controle total sobre Alien X, sem risco de perda de consciência ou dificuldades em acessar a forma alienígena. 3. Sem limitações ou consequências negativas: Qualquer ação desencadeada pelos poderes de Alien X não teria consequências involuntárias ou efeitos colaterais adversos. As intenções do anfitrião se manifestariam perfeitamente na realidade. 4. Onipotência absoluta: Alien X seria capaz de fazer qualquer coisa sem exceção, incluindo coisas além do nosso entendimento como a criação ou destruição de universos inteiros instantaneamente e sem esforço. 5. Onisciência: A versão perfeita de Alien X saberia tudo o que pode ser conhecido, permitindo que ele tomasse decisões completamente informadas e cumprisse perfeitamente a vontade do anfitrião. 6. Onipresença: Ele seria capaz de existir em qualquer lugar e em todo lugar simultaneamente, tornando-se uma entidade transcendente não limitada pelo espaço ou tempo. Embora uma versão literalmente perfeita do Alien X seja concebível no domínio da ficção e da imaginação, na prática, a existência de tal ser superaria os limites da realidade como a conhecemos e entraria no reino da onipotência divina, existindo além de qualquer coisa que a série \\"Ben 10\\" possa realisticamente retratar."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Criar uma versão literalmente perfeita de um ser fictício implica reimaginar suas características dentro das limitações e possibilidades do universo real. No entanto, é importante destacar que, no universo real, a capacidade de fazer absolutamente qualquer coisa, como a descrita nas habilidades do Alien X, não é compatível com as leis da física e da realidade como a entendemos. Portanto, é impossível criar uma réplica exata do Alien X no mundo real. Porém, se considerarmos a perfeição literal em termos de fidelidade ao designer original da série animada, criar uma réplica perfeita pode envolver vários passos: 1. **Pesquisa Detalhada**: Coletar o máximo de informação possível sobre o Alien X, incluindo imagens de alta qualidade e descrições detalhadas de suas habilidades, aparência e personalidade. 2. **Design Gráfico 3D**: Utilizar softwares avançados de modelagem 3D para criar um modelo digital detalhado do Alien X, replicando todas as suas características visuais com precisão. 3. **Impressão 3D**: Imprimir o modelo em escala real usando impressoras 3D de alta resolução, escolhendo materiais que melhor imitem a textura e o brilho observado na entidade fictícia. 4. **Pintura e Acabamento**: Pintar a réplica com precisão para capturar as cores e padrões exatos do Alien X, e aplicar revestimentos que simulem quaisquer efeitos especiais (como um brilho cósmico). 5. **Inteligência Artificial**: Para imitar o comportamento inteligente do Alien X, poderia-se programar um sistema de inteligência artificial avançado, que lhe permitisse interagir e responder a estímulos de forma convincente e complexa. 6. **Funcionalidades Interativas**: Incutir na réplica tecnologias interativas, como sensores de movimento, projeções holográficas e efeitos sonoros, para dar a ilusão de poderes e presença. 7. **Exibição**: Posicionar a réplica em um ambiente controlado onde ela pode ser exibida, talvez com iluminação especial e efeitos de cenário para reforçar a ilusão de onipotência e misticismo do Alien X. 8. **Narrativa Contextual**: Para aqueles que interagem com a réplica, seria importante criar uma narrativa imersiva que explique as limitações da réplica em comparação com as habilidades fictícias do verdadeiro Alien X. Claro, todos esses passos produziriam apenas uma réplica estática (ou parcialmente interativa) que refletiria o aspecto visual e a estética do Alien X, mas sem suas habilidades de controlar a realidade. Uma representação verdadeiramente perfeita, no sentido literal do poder do Alien X, permanece no reino da imaginação e da ficção científica."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Настройки принтера: Разные принтеры могут иметь различные настройки по умолчанию для плотности печати (даркнесс), что может сделать один и тот же шрифт более или менее насыщенным на разных устройствах. 2. Качество чернил или тонера: Если вы печатаете документ, состояние и качество чернил или тонера в вашем принтере могут влиять на результат. Свежие высококачественные чернила или тонер обычно дают более темный и четкий вывод. 3. Разрешение принтера: Разные принтеры могут иметь различное разрешение печати (измеряемое в DPI – точках на дюйм). Принтеры с высоким разрешением обычно печатают текст более четко и насыщенно. 4. Монитор и настройки видео: Если вы сравниваете не напечатанные документы, а просматриваете их на экране, различия в настройках мониторов и видеокарт могут приводить к визуальным отличиям в восприятии цвета и контрастности шрифтов. 5. Вид шрифта: Несмотря на то, что вы оба используете Courier New, могут быть незначительные различия в версиях этого шрифта, в результате чего они могут отличаться по насыщенности на разных компьютерах. 6. Форматирование Word: Возможно, у других сценаристов настройки жирности (Bold), контрастности или другие форматы текста в Word установлены по-другому, что делает их текст темнее. 7. Предпочтения пользователя: Некоторые сценаристы предпочитают использовать не стандартные шрифты, а специализированные шрифты для сценариев вроде Courier Final Draft, которые специально разработаны для работы над сценариями и могут казаться темнее стандартного Courier New. Чтобы убедиться в том, что ваш текст выглядит так, как вы того хотите, вы можете протестировать различные настройки печати и проверить, правильно ли настроен ваш Word, а также сравнить шрифт на разных устройствах. Кроме того, вы можете посмотреть на настройки шрифта в самих документах других сценаристов, если у вас есть доступ к их файлам."},{"instruction":"я про pdf","output":"Если вы замечаете, что у сценаристов шрифт выглядит темнее в PDF-файлах, чем ваш текст в шрифте Courier New, используя Word 2007, возможные причины могут включать следующее: 1. **Преобразование в PDF**: Процесс создания PDF из Word может приводить к различиям в отображении шрифтов. Разные программы и методы конвертации (например, использование функции \\"Сохранить как PDF\\" в Word, Adobe Acrobat или онлайн-конвертеров) могут давать разный результат по отношению к качеству и насыщенности текста. 2. **Свойства PDF**: При создании PDF можно задавать различные настройки создания документа, включая уровни сжатия и опцию сохранения шрифтов. Если текст сжат слишком сильно, это может повлиять на его читабельность и насыщенность. 3. **Встроенные шрифты**: Для обеспечения одинакового отображения на всех устройствах шрифты могут быть встроены в PDF-файл. Если в вашем PDF шрифты не встроены, вместо этого может использоваться заменяющий шрифт, который выглядит менее насыщенно. 4. **Оттенок шрифта и настройки**: Даже если оба шрифта называются \\"Courier New\\", могут быть незначительные отличия в версиях шрифтов или в их визуальных характеристиках. 5. **Различные версии программ**: При использовании различных версий программы Word или PDF-редакторов, могут быть разные механизмы рендеринга текста, которые влияют на то, как текст выглядит при печати или на экране. 6. **Устройство просмотра**: Различия в экранах и настройках просмотра PDF устройств могут также влиять на восприятие густоты текста. Читабельность может значительно варьировать в зависимости от размера экрана, его разрешения и настроенной яркости или контрастности. 7. **Фон PDF**: Подложка, на которую нанесен текст, тоже может визуально повлиять на восприятие темноты текста. Если фон PDF немного отличается по цвету (не совсем белый), это может внести изменения в ощущение контраста между текстом и фоном. Для того чтобы устранить эти различия, убедитесь, что вы правильно встроили шрифт при создании PDF, проверьте настройки программы экспорта в PDF и либо адаптируйте настройки сжатия, либо используйте опцию печати высокого качества.

However, I can guide you on how to create or commission such a design. To create a t-shirt design that matches your description, you would need to follow these steps: 1. Concept Sketch: Start with a sketch of a cool cat character in a dynamic, playful pose that embodies the essence of graffiti street art. 2. Color Selection: Stick with your color palette of yellow, black, and red. Since these are strong, contrasting colors, they will stand out against a white background. 3. Vector Illustration: Using software like Adobe Illustrator, create your design in vector format. This will ensure that the design can be scaled to 8K resolution without losing quality. Use smooth and clean lines to define the cat and give it a highly detailed appearance. 4. Graffiti Styling: Incorporate graffiti elements such as bold, stylized lettering or splashes of paint around your cool cat character, adhering to your color scheme. 5. Sticker Effect: Add a border around your cat design to give it a \\"sticker\\" look. Ensure the outline is bold and contrasts well with the white background, so it pops like a physical sticker would. 6. Final Touches: Add shading, highlights, and any intricate details to give your cat character depth and make it look more professional and polished. 7. Output: Set up the file with the necessary bleed and margins as per printing requirements, and export the design at an 8K resolution for the best quality printing results. If you're not a designer or if you want someone else to create this for you, you could hire a professional graphic designer or illustrator, especially one with experience in cartoon and graffiti styles. Provide them with the detailed description just as you've given here, and they would be able to turn your idea into visual reality. When commissioning the work, make sure to specify you need it in a vector format for high-quality printing at large scales, and that it should be suitable for a white background to ensure color vibrancy and contrast."},{"instruction":"did you know any information after 2024?","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I was last trained on data up until September 2021, so I do not have access to new information or events that occurred after that time — which means I don't have data from 2024 or after.

Однако, если вы говорите о написании сценария для такого фильма, то есть несколько программ, которые могут помочь сценаристам в их работе. Вот некоторые из наиболее популярных: 1. **Final Draft** Это одна из самых известных и широко используемых программ для сценаристов. Она предназначена специально для написания сценариев, предлагает множество функций, которые облегчают организацию текста по стандарту индустрии, автоматически форматируя текст на лету. 2. **Celtx** Celtx — это более доступная альтернатива, которая также предоставляет инструменты для написания сценариев и производства. Программа предлагает средства для совместной работы и различные шаблоны для сценариев, графических романов и даже мультимедийных проекций. 3. **WriterDuet** Это облачное решение для сценаристов, которое позволяет работать в реальном времени с разными участниками проекта. WriterDuet предлагает функции совместной работы и имеет интерфейс, который позволяет пользователям легко вносить изменения и комментарии в документ. 4. **Scrivener** Хотя Scrivener не создан специально для сценариев, это мощный инструмент для любого вида письма, включая сценарии. Программа предоставляет писателям расширенные возможности по организации материала и структурированию проектов, что может быть полезно в начальной фазе разработки сценария. 5. **Fade In** Это профессиональное программное обеспечение для написания сценариев, которое становится все более популярным среди писателей. Fade In предлагает широкий спектр функций для форматирования сценариев и управления ревизиями, а также инструменты для сотрудничества. 6. **Highland** Для пользователей Mac, Highland может быть хорошим выбором. Это минималистичная программа для написания сценариев, которая делает упор на использование простого текста, тем самым минимизируя отвлекающие факторы, чтобы писатели могли сосредоточиться на творческом процессе. Выбор правильной программы зависит от индивидуальных предпочтений писателя, необходимости совместной работы с другими лицами и буджета. Но не забывайте, что технологии — лишь инструменты, и качество фильма в конечном итоге зависит от таланта и усилий команды, работающей над проектом."},{"instruction":"Crie uma versão literalmente suprema do Alien X","output":"A versão literalmente suprema de Alien X dentro do contexto de \\"Ben 10\\" exigiria um aprimoramento tão extremo de suas habilidades que já são incrivelmente poderosas, que quase o tornaria um ser onipotente ou, pelo menos, um dos mais poderosos do universo.

Para torná-lo \\"supremo,\\" poderíamos imaginar o seguinte: **Alien X Supremo:** **Poderes Maximizados:** Suas habilidades de alterar a realidade, manipular o tempo e o espaço seriam ampliadas ao ponto de poderem ser exercidas com um pensamento, sem necessidade de debate interno entre suas personalidades. **Integração de Personalidades:** O Alien X Supremo teria controle total e unificado de suas três personalidades, Bellicus, Serena e Ben, permitindo decisões e ações imediatas sem a necessidade de consenso interno. **Consciência Universal:** O Alien X Supremo teria uma percepção onisciente, o que permitiria que ele soubesse tudo o que acontece no universo em tempo real, tornando-o praticamente onisciente. **Defesas Absolutas:** Sua invulnerabilidade seria tão completa que nenhuma forma de energia ou ataque físico do multiverso poderia afetá-lo. **Capacidade de Criação:** Poderia criar vida e matéria sem limites, moldando universos inteiros ao seu desejo. **Manipulação de Probabilidades:** Tanto tão poderoso que poderia alterar a probabilidade de eventos ocorrerem ou não, basicamente ditando o \\"destino\\" de certa maneira. **Telepatia e Manipulação Mental:** Ser capaz de se comunicar e manipular a mente de qualquer ser no universo, transcendendo barreiras de idioma e realidade. **Controle Total sobre as Forças Fundamentais:** Compreender e manipular as quatro forças fundamentais do universo (gravidade, eletromagnetismo, e forças nucleares forte e fraca) em um nível primordial. **Imunidade Temporal:** Seria completamente imune a quaisquer alterações no tempo, como viagens temporais ou paradoxos, existindo fora do tempo linear. **Omnilinguagem:** Capaz de se comunicar e ser entendido por qualquer ser em qualquer língua ou método de comunicação. **Gestão da Existência:** Poder de apagar seres ou objetos da existência ou trazê-los de volta, como se estivessem gerenciando os próprios fundamentos da existência. **Nível de Abstração:** Chegar a um ponto em que ele seria mais uma força ou conceito do que um ser físico, uma personificação do próprio universo ou da realidade. Este Alien X Supremo se aproximaria da ideia de um deus dentro da série \\"Ben 10\\", caminhando na linha entre um personagem e uma entidade abstrata que representa a própria essência da criação e destruição, a realidade e a fantasia.

This essay aims to explore the impact of race on non-ideal victims, including the portrayal of victims in society, the criminal justice system's response, and the experiences of black boys and young men with the criminal justice system in England and Wales. I. Portrayal of Victims in Society The articles highlight how race influences the perception and portrayal of victims in society. \\"The ideal victim through other(s') eyes\\" examines how victims who align with dominant racial and social norms are more likely to be considered ideal victims and receive greater support and sympathy. On the other hand, victims from racial minority groups, particularly black boys and young men, are often deemed non-ideal victims due to racial biases and stereotypes. This portrayal affects the social recognition and validation of non-ideal victims, exacerbating the challenges they face. II. Racial Inequities in the Criminal Justice System Race strongly influences the treatment of non-ideal victims within the criminal justice system, as discussed in \\"The ideal victim: A critical race theory (CRT) approach\\" and \\"Criminal Justice as State Racism: Race-Making, State Violence, and Imprisonment in the USA, and England and Wales.\\" These articles argue that racial biases and systemic racism contribute to the overrepresentation and harsher treatment of racial minority individuals within the criminal justice system. The experiences of black boys and young men in England and Wales, as explored in \\"Black Boys’ and Young Men's Experiences with Criminal Justice and Desistance in England and Wales,\\" further highlight the racial disparities they face, leading to increased surveillance, arrest rates, and harsher sentences. III. Impacts on Seeking Justice The influence of race on seeking justice for non-ideal victims cannot be ignored. The racial biases and discrimination within the criminal justice system discussed in the articles undermine the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of the system for racial minority victims. As a result, racial minority victims may face greater difficulties in obtaining justice and redress, further eroding their trust in the system and discouraging their willingness to seek justice. IV. Support and Desistance The racial dynamics and biases discussed in the articles also impact the support and opportunities for desistance available to non-ideal victims. \\"Black Boys’ and Young Men's Experiences with Criminal Justice and Desistance in England and Wales\\" highlights the challenges faced by black boys and young men after contact with the criminal justice system. The lack of support and limited opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration into society perpetuate cycles of crime and hinder the prospects of desistance. The racial disparities in access to support and opportunities for desistance further compound the difficulties for non-ideal victims. Conclusion: Race plays a significant role in shaping the experiences of non-ideal victims. The portrayal of victims in society, racial inequities within the criminal justice system, and the impact on seeking justice and obtaining support all contribute to the differential treatment and experiences of non-ideal victims based on race. Addressing racial biases and systemic racism within the criminal justice system, increasing support and opportunities for rehabilitation, and promoting inclusivity and equality in society are crucial in mitigating the effects of race on non-ideal victims. This would ultimately lead to a more just and equitable society for all."},{"instruction":"种族对非理想受害人的影响，写一个300字的intro","output":"种族对非理想受害者的影响 种族对非理想受害者产生了重要的影响。随着时间的推移，社会对于受害者的定义和关注不断演化，然而，种族背景仍然在决定着受害者的地位和所受到的关注程度。通过研究\\"描述理想的受害者："},{"instruction":"流行性感冒发病数预测问题的研究","output":"预测流行性感冒发病数是一个重要的研究问题，可以为公共卫生部门提供有关疫情的预警和决策支持。下面是对这个问题的一些研究方向和方法的介绍： 1. 时间序列分析：使用时间序列分析方法，通过对过去流行性感冒发病数的历史数据进行分析和建模，来预测未来的发病数。常用的时间序列分析方法包括ARIMA模型、指数平滑法、GARCH模型等。 2. 机器学习方法：利用机器学习方法对流行性感冒的发病数进行预测。可以使用监督学习方法，通过建立模型，利用相关特征（如气象数据、人口流动数据等）来预测发病数。常用的机器学习方法包括线性回归、随机森林、支持向量机等。 3. 结合外部数据和社交媒体分析：除了传统的数据源，如流行性感冒病例报告，还可以结合外部数据源和社交媒体数据进行分析。通过分析气象数据、病毒传播模型、人口流动数据等外部数据，以及对公众在社交媒体上关于感冒的讨论和症状报告等信息的分析，可以提高预测模型的准确性和时效性。 4. 异质网络分析：流行性感冒的传播是一个复杂的过程，涉及到多个地理位置和不同群体的互动。可以利用异质网络分析方法，将地理位置、人群流动、病毒传播等因素纳入考虑，以更好地理解和预测流行性感冒的发病数。 5. 集成预测方法：将多个不同的模型进行集成，通过加权平均或模型组合的方式，来提高流行性感冒发病数预测的准确性和鲁棒性。 在进行流行性感冒发病数预测研究时，需要充分考虑数据质量、特征选择、模型建立和评估等因素，并进行合理的模型选择和参数调优。此外，还需要不断更新数据和改进模型，以提高预测效果，并将预测结果与实际情况进行验证和修正。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in 2023, this has not occurred and is not something that is widely documented or announced in any official capacity. Should Weird Al actually get involved in creating a game based on the Half-Life universe, it would be quite an unusual and unexpected collaboration, since he is primarily known for his work in the music industry and not videogame development. In the hypothetical scenario where Weird Al did make a game based on HL2, it might feature parodic elements and humor akin to his musical work, providing a comedic take on the usually serious and atmospheric Half-Life series. However, this is purely speculative. If there are developments in this scenario beyond my last update in 2023, you may need to check the latest sources or news for accurate information."},{"instruction":"make uit up","output":"Alright!

You play as Weird Al, armed with a Polka-powered accordion and a wit sharp enough to cut through space-time fabric. **Gameplay:** - **Parody Weapons:** Swap out the traditional HL2 arsenal for parody-themed gadgets and instruments, from the \\"Accordion of Annihilation\\" to the \\"Satirical Singing Sawblade.\\" Each item not only serves as a weapon but can also control enemies through the power of parodies and satire. - **Musical Puzzles:** Solve intricate puzzles that require you to compose melodies, riff on popular songs, or harmonize with alien choirs to disable force fields or persuade turrets to sing along instead of shooting. - **Comedic Challenges:** Complete impromptu comedy challenges to win over the support of resistance fighters, such as stand-up battles against Combine Comedians or rap battles with rhythmically gifted headcrabs. - **Custom Soundtrack:** As players journey through the game, they unlock Weird Al's parody versions of the iconic Half-Life soundtrack, with songs like \\"Combine Paradise\\" and \\"All About The HEV.\\" **Story:** \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic is sucked into the \\"Half-Life\\" universe via a resonance cascade caused by a science experiment gone wrong during a music video shoot. He teams up with familiar faces like Alyx Vance and Barney, who are now equipped with jokebooks and slapstick gadgets, on a quest to free Gourdeon Freefun and restore laughter to a world oppressed by the humorless Combine. **Humor:** True to Weird Al's style, the game is filled with puns, visual gags, and Easter eggs referencing his song parodies. Even the enemies get in on the act, with Civil Protection officers occasionally bursting into Weird Al song covers and antlions performing synchronized dance routines to polka tunes. **Ending:** The climactic battle features a \\"Weird Al\\" concert where the music's sheer comedic energy overloads the Combine's control network, freeing humanity. With the earth saved, Weird Al rides off into the sunset on a Segway, as credits roll to a parody version of \\"Still Alive.\\" **DLC (Downloadable Content):** \\"Al's Costume Party\\" - Players can unlock and choose from various iconic Weird Al costumes, turning City 17 into the backdrop for history's weirdest fashion show. Although this game doesn't exist, it would be an incredibly fun mesh of the Half-Life world's seriousness with Weird Al's signature humor and parodies.

However, a commonly used measure to determine a healthy weight range is the Body Mass Index (BMI). For a 19-year-old male who is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall, the BMI can be used to estimate a healthy weight range. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered within the normal weight range for adults. Here's how to calculate BMI and the corresponding weight range for a healthy BMI: BMI = weight in kilograms / (height in meters)^2 For a person who is 175 cm tall, their height in meters is 1.75. To find a healthy weight range using the normal BMI range: Lower end of healthy weight (BMI of 18.5): 18.5 = weight / (1.75)^2 weight = 18.5 * (1.75)^2 weight ≈ 56.5 kg ≈ 125 lbs Upper end of healthy weight (BMI of 24.9): 24.9 = weight / (1.75)^2 weight = 24.9 * (1.75)^2 weight ≈ 76 kg ≈ 168 lbs So, according to BMI, a 19-year-old male who is 5'9\\" should weigh between approximately 125 pounds (56.5 kilograms) and 168 pounds (76 kilograms) to be considered in a healthy weight range. However, BMI is a simplified measure and does not take into account muscle mass, which might lead to higher weight without necessarily indicating an unhealthy condition. Athletes and individuals with high muscle mass may have a BMI that suggests they are overweight or obese when they are actually in excellent health. For a more accurate assessment, a healthcare professional may consider other factors, including waist circumference, body composition analysis, and overall health markers. Regular exercise, balanced diet, and a healthy lifestyle are also important components that contribute to an individual's overall health and wellness, beyond the number on a scale."},{"instruction":"if i was 114 pounds at 5'9 19 y/o as a male how many calories should i eat to get to 150 pounds?","output":"Gaining weight in a healthy manner requires a deliberate approach that involves consistent caloric surplus and possibly an exercise regimen focused on strength training to ensure that much of the weight gained is muscle. To gain weight, you'll need to consume more calories than your body uses in a day. An often-cited starting point is to add 500 calories per day to your maintenance calorie needs, which is the amount of calories required for you to maintain your current weight. Firstly, to estimate your daily calorie needs for maintenance, you can use the Harris-Benedict Equation: For men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years) At 114 pounds (approximately 51.7 kg) and 5'9\\" (175 cm), your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) would be roughly: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × 51.7) + (4.799 × 175) - (5.677 × 19) BMR = 88.362 + (693) + (839.825) - (107.863) BMR ≈ 1513.324 This BMR is the number of calories your body needs to carry out fundamental physiological functions. However, you also need to factor in your physical activity level. This is done using the Physical Activity Level (PAL) multiplier: - Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2 - Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375 - Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55 - Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR × 1.725 - Extra active (very hard exercise & physical job or training twice a day): BMR × 1.9 For example, if you are lightly active: Maintenance Calories = 1513 × 1.375 ≈ 2080 calories/day. Now to gain weight, let's add 500 calories for a consistent weight gain: 2080 + 500 = 2580 calories/day. To reach your goal of 150 pounds, you would consume 2580 calories per day, but you should keep in mind that as you gain weight, your BMR and maintenance calories will increase as well, so you'll need to reassess your caloric needs periodically. Remember, this is an estimate. The actual number of calories required can vary based on metabolism, genetics, daily activity, and muscle mass. It is also crucial to ensure that the calories come from nutritious foods to promote healthy weight gain and overall health. Also, you might want to consider consulting with a healthcare provider, dietitian, or certified nutritionist to tailor a plan specific to your individual health needs and goals, especially if you're planning a significant change in your weight. They can provide guidance on how to gain weight safely and may advise on a more gradual increase in calorie intake."},{"instruction":"how long would it take","output":"The time it takes to gain weight can vary from person to person, as it depends on numerous factors such as your metabolism, lifestyle, the quality of your diet, and how consistently you're able to maintain a caloric surplus. As a general rule of thumb, a caloric surplus of about 3,500 calories is approximately equal to a gain of one pound of body weight. If you intend to gain 36 pounds (which is the difference between 114 and 150 pounds), this would theoretically require a total caloric surplus of about 126,000 calories (36 pounds × 3,500 calories per pound). If you maintain a consistent daily surplus of 500 calories (which is commonly recommended for a safe and gradual weight gain), the calculation would be: 126,000 total calorie surplus ÷ 500 calories per day = 252 days This means that to gain 36 pounds, it might take around 252 days, or about 8 months, if you consistently eat an extra 500 calories every day. However, as you gain weight, your body's caloric needs will increase because a heavier body requires more energy to maintain its weight. Furthermore, not all the weight gained will be pure body fat. Ideally, with a good strength training program, some of this weight will be muscle, which is beneficial for your overall health and metabolism. Muscle growth can also fluctuate based on individual response to training and nutrition, potentially altering the time frame. It's important to monitor your progress regularly and adjust your caloric intake as needed, and also to ensure the additional calories come from a balanced diet rich in whole foods, protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Consulting a healthcare provider, dietitian, or a certified fitness professional would be beneficial to set realistic goals and create a plan that ensures a healthy and sustainable weight gain process."},{"instruction":"can you take into account the fact that weighing more will take more calories to gain weight?","output":"Certainly! The caloric needs for maintaining and gaining weight will change as a person gains weight because more body mass requires more energy for maintenance. To approximate this, let's consider a stepped approach, where we reassess calorie needs at certain intervals of weight gain. For the sake of simplicity, let's recalculate the calorie needs every 5 pounds gained. Using the Harris-Benedict Equation: For men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years) Let's use a Lightly active multiplier from the Physical Activity Level (PAL) which is: Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375 At every 5-pound increment, we can recalculate the maintenance calories, and then by adding the 500-calorie surplus, we get the new daily calorie target for weight gain. Let's take two checkpoints: **At 119 pounds (54 kg):** BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × 54) + (4.799 × 175) - (5.677 × 19) BMR ≈ 1543.51 Maintenance Calories (lightly active) ≈ 1543.51 × 1.375 Maintenance Calories + 500 calorie surplus ≈ 2624.95 **At 144 pounds (65 kg):** BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × 65) + (4.799 × 175) - (5.677 × 19) BMR ≈ 1719.635 Maintenance Calories (lightly active) ≈ 1719.635 × 1.375 Maintenance Calories + 500 calorie surplus ≈ 2869.99 This means that as the individual gains weight, they will need to periodically reassess their caloric needs to ensure they're still in a surplus. Here's a simplified approach: 1. Calculate BMR and add 500 calories to determine a starting point. 2. Every 5 pounds gained, recalculate BMR and the required caloric surplus. 3. Adjust diet based on the new calculations to maintain a surplus. Remember, these numbers are approximations and might not be precise for every individual due to differences in metabolism, body composition, and daily activity other than exercise. Furthermore, the actual absorption and utilization of calories can vary between individuals depending on digestive efficiency and other factors. Given these complexities, consistent monitoring and adjusting are crucial. Using tools like weigh-ins, measuring body composition, and tracking food intake can help to ensure that weight gain is progressing in a controlled and healthy manner. Always consult with a healthcare or nutrition professional when making significant dietary changes or embarking on a weight gain journey."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
