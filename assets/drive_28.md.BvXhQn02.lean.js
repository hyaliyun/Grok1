One might make the argument that Mr. Rathbone's screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions afforded Mr. Brett and to this I would agree. However when all is said and done Jeremy Brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly become Sherlock Holmes.

While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking (which dogs do to establish territory through scent), became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.

This is a concerning trend, especially when we consider that between 30 and 50 per cent of all food produced is never eaten. The study also found that 72 per cent of respondents said they were tempted by Buy One Get One Free offers. While tempting deals like this can help us save money, they can also lead us to buy more than we need. In fact, 70 per cent of respondents admitted to buying more because of these deals. It's important to recognize the impact that food waste can have on our environment. When we throw away food, we are also throwing away the resources that went into producing it, such as energy, water, and land. Moreover, food waste produces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. So, what can we do to reduce our food waste? One simple step is to plan our meals and only buy what we need. By creating a shopping list based on a meal plan, we can avoid buying excess food that we may not end up using. Additionally, we can consider buying imperfect produce and using up leftovers in creative ways.

What makes this course unique is that Allred will only assign readings by black feminists, ensuring that the course is centered on the perspectives of those who are most affected by the issues it will address.

Students will also be encouraged to engage with current events and social media conversations surrounding Beyonce and her work. Some may question the validity of studying Beyonce in an academic setting or dismiss the course as frivolous, but the issues that it will address are anything but.

One day you may be able to improve your pitch—and even acquire perfect pitch—with little more than a trip to the drugstore, NPR reports. That's because researchers are studying a moodstabilizing drug that enables an adult brain to take in new information as it did during early childhood. The drug restores the plasticity of the brain to a juvenile state, says Takao Hensch, coauthor of a new study on the subject. Hensch tested the enzymeinhibitor on several young men who had received no musical training in childhood. They made efforts to train their ears, and after two weeks did far better on pitch tests than those who had taken a placebo, Raw Story reports. So what's the big deal? There are no known reports of adults acquiring absolute pitch, Hensch says. In fact, the drug could rewire otherwise firmly established pathways in the brain, according to the study. So you could learn new languages fairly easily, for example—but Hensch calls it a process that one probably would not want to tamper with carelessly. Expand this summary.","output":"Researchers are investigating a mood-stabilizing drug that can help adults improve their pitch and develop perfect pitch as if they were in their childhood.

In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is languagespecific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan.

Both players were known for their accuracy and consistency, often being relied upon to score critical points for their teams. When comparing the number of field goals each kicker made over their careers, it is clear that Matt Stover was the more prolific scorer. Stover made a total of 471 field goals over his 20-year career, which ranks fourth all-time in the NFL. His field goal percentage was also impressive, with a career average of 83.7%. In comparison, Rob Bironas made a total of 239 field goals over his 10-year career, which is a respectable number but pales in comparison to Stover's. Bironas was known for his long-range field goals, with a career-long of 60 yards, but his accuracy was not quite as consistent as Stover's. Bironas' career field goal percentage was 76.4%. It is worth noting that both kickers had impressive moments during their careers. Stover made a game-winning field goal in Super Bowl XXXV to help the Ravens win the championship, while Bironas had a memorable performance in a 2007 game against the Houston Texans where he made eight field goals, the most ever in a single game.

Here's How to Calculate Your Salary: First, you need to determine if you are a wage earner, which means that you receive an hourly rate for your work. Once you have established that, you can find out your hourly salary by looking at your pay stub or asking your HR department. Next, If you work a fixed number of hours per week, you can simply multiply your hourly salary by the number of hours worked in a week and then by 52 weeks to calculate your annual salary. However, if you work a different amount of hours each week, you should average your weekly number of hours for the year. For example, if you work 40 hours one week and 30 hours the next, you would average that to 35 hours per week for the year. If you work overtime, make sure to add in those payments as well. Overtime pay is typically at a higher rate than regular pay, so it's important to factor that in to get an accurate picture of your total annual income.

When your posture is straight, it helps you to breathe better and project your voice more powerfully. It also shows that you’re taking the conversation seriously and are engaged in what the other person is saying. Second, make eye contact. This shows that you’re paying attention and are interested in what the other person is saying. However, it’s important to avoid staring; instead, make sure to break eye contact occasionally to avoid coming across as aggressive or uninterested. Third, smile. A smile is a natural ice-breaker and can help to put the other person at ease. It communicates that you’re approachable and open to conversation. Additionally, it helps to create a positive atmosphere, which can make the entire interaction more pleasant for both parties. Using these body language techniques can help you to come across as confident, approachable, and competent in any conversation.

If you're looking for a way to revamp your leather piece or simply extend its lifespan, here's a helpful guide on how to disassemble, clean, and prep your leather for a new finish. To begin, you'll want to lay down drop cloths to protect your work area. This will prevent any accidental spills or drips from damaging your surfaces. Next, disassemble your leather item as much as possible. This will allow you to reach all the nooks and crannies of the piece for a thorough cleaning. Once the piece is disassembled, wipe down the surface of the leather with isopropyl alcohol. This will remove any dirt, oils, or other debris that may have accumulated on the surface. Be sure to use a clean, lint-free cloth for this step. After wiping down the leather, use a fine grit sandpaper to lightly sand any shiny areas of the leather. This will create a rougher surface that will make it easier for the new finish to adhere. Take care not to sand too aggressively, as this can damage the leather. Once you have sanded the leather, wipe it down once again with a damp cloth to remove any sanding dust. Then, apply a leather preparer and deglazer to the surface of the leather. This will help to remove any remaining sealers or finishes on the leather and prepare it for a new coat of dye or finish. Following these steps will help you to clean and prep your leather item for a fresh new look. With a little care and attention, your leather piece can look as good as new for years to come."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Blackandwhitemarkeachchairalthoughtheystillplaytogether","output":"Black and white mark each chair, although they still play together in a sentence."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Andreas Wolfsgruber (born 1962, Salzburg, Austria) is an Austrian car designer and, since 2000, Head of the Magna Steyr Design Department.

For example, states like Hawaii and Guam have much higher percentages of Pacific islanders in their populations, while other states may have very few. The census is a crucial tool for understanding demographic trends and changes within the United States. By collecting data on race, ethnicity, age, gender, and other factors, the census provides valuable insights into the makeup of the population and helps policymakers make informed decisions about issues like education, healthcare, and social services. In addition to providing information on specific population groups, the census also helps identify areas where resources are needed. For example, if a certain region has a higher percentage of elderly individuals, policymakers may allocate more funding for senior care services in that area. Overall, understanding the percentage of people who are not Pacific islander is just one piece of the broader picture of demographic data provided by the census. By using this data to inform policy decisions, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just society for all Americans."},{"instruction":"Read this: In 1663 at the Archbishop of Canterbury's residence, Lambeth Palace, a Gothic hammerbeam roof was built to replace that destroyed when the building was sacked during the English Civil War.

In response to the charge, Whelan has requested a non-personal hearing. Whelan's comments were made during an interview with The Guardian, in which he defended the appointment of Malky Mackay as Wigan's manager in the face of criticism over allegations of racism and anti-Semitism made against Mackay. Whelan claimed that his own comments were not offensive, stating that it was \\"nothing\\" to call a Chinese person a \\"chink\\". He also reportedly said that Jewish people \\"chase money\\". Such comments are obviously unacceptable and have no place in society, let alone in football, which should be a sport that welcomes individuals from all backgrounds. The FA has been swift in taking action, charging Whelan and giving him until December 5th to respond. It remains to be seen what penalty, if any, he will face. What is clear is that the fallout from this incident has cast a dark cloud over Wigan Athletic, whose fans must now wonder whether their chairman's comments reflect the views of the club as a whole. It is also a reminder that football, despite its many positive qualities, still has work to do in terms of tackling racism and discrimination. As for Whelan, he has apologized for any offence caused by his comments, but this does not excuse their impact. It is important that those in positions of power and influence understand the responsibility that comes with their role, and take care not to make comments that could be seen as offensive or discriminatory.
