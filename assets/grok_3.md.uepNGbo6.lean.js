Upset that his joke fell flat, he told another one: “What do you call a PhD without a job?” Again, silence. He tried to save himself with an explanation: “Actually, that's a trick question, because you're never really without a job when you have a PhD. You just switch to ‘unpaid researcher’.” Still, nobody laughed. Dejected, the professor tried to move on to his main talk, but the awkward silence lingered. He decided to take a risk, and spilled his heart out: “You know what, folks? I feel like I should come clean. The truth is, I've been telling PhD jokes for years, but I don't really understand what they do. Can someone explain to me what a PhD actually is?” A hush fell over the room as everyone looked at each other, wondering who would answer. Finally, a bold young student raised her hand and spoke up: “Well, sir, a PhD is a rigorous program of academic study and research that prepares graduates to advance the frontiers of knowledge in their field, with the aim of making valuable contributions to society through discovery, innovation, and critical thinking.” The professor listened intently, nodding his head. “Oh, I see,” he said. “So basically, it's like going through a divorce.” Puzzled looks turned into laughter, and the crowd went wild. From that day on, the professor became known for his long-winded jokes that ended with a wicked punchline. And the student who answered his question? She ended up getting a PhD herself, and carried on the tradition of humor and humility."},{"instruction":"What are the environmental impacts of semiconductor production?","output":"The environmental impacts of semiconductor production include the use of large amounts of energy and water, production of hazardous wastes and emissions of greenhouse gases, air pollutants and toxic chemicals."},{"instruction":"What are some controversies related to AfricanAmerican representation in literature, film, or other media?","output":"Some controversies related to African-American representation in literature, film or other media include issues of racial stereotyping, tokenism, lack of diversity among creators and decision-makers, whitewashing, and cultural appropriation."},{"instruction":"Provide a history of the use of plastics in the food industry.","output":"Plastics were first used in the food industry in the 1950s to package and preserve food.

The widespread economic hardships caused by the depression ultimately had a significant impact on global politics, exacerbating many pre-existing tensions and leading to the rise of authoritarian regimes in several countries. One of the most immediate effects of the Great Depression was the collapse of international trade. As countries became increasingly protectionist in an attempt to safeguard their domestic industries, global trade volumes fell dramatically. This economic nationalism created new political tensions between countries that had previously been trading partners, and the resulting reduction in global economic interconnectedness made it more difficult for countries to cooperate on international issues. Another significant effect of the Great Depression was the rise of extremist political movements in many countries. In Germany, for example, the economic hardship caused by the depression greatly contributed to the popularity of the Nazi party, which eventually seized power in 1933. Similarly, Italy's fascist party capitalized on public discontent with the worsening economic conditions to win support and usher in a period of totalitarian rule. Perhaps most importantly, the Great Depression weakened the existing world order and paved the way for the emergence of new superpowers. The economic stagnation in Europe and the United States allowed for the rise of other powers, particularly Japan and the Soviet Union. This shift in the balance of power ultimately set the stage for World War II and the subsequent Cold War. Overall, the Great Depression had a profound impact on global politics. It caused political tensions to rise, contributed to the rise of extremist political movements, and facilitated the emergence of new superpowers. The events of the 1930s continue to shape international relations to this day, reminding us of the importance of economic stability to global political stability."},{"instruction":"What are some notable landmarks in North Florida with urban legend origins?","output":"Some notable landmarks in North Florida with urban legend origins are the Devil's Chair in Cassadaga, the Haunted Lighthouse in St. Augustine, and the Ghost of Bellamy Bridge in Marianna."},{"instruction":"What is the impact of landfills on the environment?","output":"Landfills have a negative impact on the environment due to the emission of greenhouse gases, generation of leachate that pollutes soil and water, and the release of toxins and air pollutants."},{"instruction":"What are some of the cultural values that shape attitudes towards motherhood in Malaysia?","output":"Some cultural values that shape attitudes towards motherhood in Malaysia include respect for family and elders, importance of maintaining harmony and unity within the family, gender roles and expectations, and emphasis on traditional practices and beliefs such as confinement and breastfeeding."},{"instruction":"What are some common inorganic compounds found in soil?","output":"Some common inorganic compounds found in soil include minerals such as quartz, feldspar, mica, and clay minerals; salts such as sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and magnesium sulfate; and metals such as iron, aluminum, and manganese."},{"instruction":"What are some potential risks of using social software?","output":"Risks of using social software may include exposure of personal information, cyberbullying, online harassment, addiction or overuse, privacy violations, and spreading of false information."},{"instruction":"w did Thomas Jefferson contribute to the study of ornithology?","output":"Thomas Jefferson contributed to the study of ornithology by documenting his observations and recordings of bird species in North America."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between fungi and bacteria?","output":"Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that have a complex cellular structure and reproduce by forming spores or through sexual reproduction.

They breed on the Antarctic ice sheet, where the female penguin lays a single egg, which is then incubated by the male penguin for up to 65 days. During this time, the female leaves to forage for food in the open ocean. Climate change has the potential to impact the reproductive success of emperor penguins in several ways. Firstly, as sea ice melts, the area for the penguins to breed and access food becomes smaller, making it harder for them to find adequate resources. Secondly, changes in sea temperature and currents can affect the food sources for the penguins, making it harder for them to forage and obtain enough nutrients to breed successfully. Additionally, changing weather patterns can lead to increased storms and sea ice break-up, which can destroy breeding colonies and lead to the loss of eggs and chicks. These factors can all contribute to decreased reproductive success in emperor penguins and threaten their overall population."},{"instruction":"What is the history of ribavirin and its use in treating viral infections?","output":"Ribavirin was first synthesized in the 1970s and was found to have antiviral properties.

When a seed is placed in a suitable environment with access to water, oxygen, and warmth, it absorbs water through its seed coat, which triggers a series of biochemical changes in the seed. The seed coat, which is the outer layer of the seed, plays an important role in plant development. It serves as a protective layer, preventing the embryo (the plant inside the seed) from drying out and being damaged by external factors, such as pests or weather conditions. The seed coat also regulates the conditions for germination by allowing water in and keeping too much out. As the embryo inside the seed starts to grow, it uses the stored nutrients in the endosperm or cotyledon and begins to form roots and shoots. The roots anchor the plant into the soil and absorb water and nutrients from the surrounding environment, while the shoots grow upwards and develop into leaves, stems, and eventually flowers or fruits. Overall, the seed coat protects the embryo and controls the environment for germination, facilitating the early stages of plant development."},{"instruction":"w can debugging tools and techniques be used to spot and resolve errors in software code?","output":"Debugging tools and techniques can be used to pinpoint and fix errors in code by identifying the precise location of the problem, monitoring the execution of the code, and providing insights into the state of the system during runtime.

This is known as Bernoulli's principle, which states that as the speed of a fluid (in this case, air) increases, its pressure decreases. As air flows over the curved upper surface of the wing, it must travel a greater distance than the air passing beneath the flatter lower surface. This results in a lower air pressure above the wing than below it, creating an upward force that is lift. Lift is essential to flight safety as it allows the aircraft to remain airborne and maintain altitude while in flight. Without sufficient lift, an aircraft would not be able to take off or stay aloft. Proper design and maintenance of the aircraft's wings and other lift-generating components are crucial to flight safety, as any malfunctions or damages could result in a loss of lift and potential crash."},{"instruction":"What challenges does Norway face in managing its vast land resources?","output":"There are several challenges that Norway faces in managing its vast land resources, including environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, climate change impacts, conflicting interests of different user groups, and balancing economic development with sustainable resource use."},{"instruction":"What is the role of technology in modern espionage?","output":"Technology plays a crucial role in modern espionage by enabling the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information more efficiently and covertly, enhancing communication and encryption capabilities, and providing new methods of surveillance and intelligence-gathering."},{"instruction":"What is the ideology behind Ukrainian nationalism and how has it evolved over time?","output":"Ukrainian nationalism is an ideology that emphasizes the cultural, linguistic, and historical distinctiveness of Ukraine from its neighboring countries.

Morse theory has also been used in the study of various problems in geometry, topology, and physics, including the classification of closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds, the topology of configuration spaces of particles, and the computation of homology and cohomology groups of manifolds."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],R={key:0},H={key:1};function j(i,e,c,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(a(!0),n(v,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",q,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
