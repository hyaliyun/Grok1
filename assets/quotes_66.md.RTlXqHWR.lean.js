Here's how to do it step by step: 1. **Create a Models Package:** Navigate to your \`posts\` application directory. You will see a \`models.py\` file there. You need to create a \`models\` directory to replace this file. 1.1. Delete or rename the \`models.py\` file (if you already have models defined in it, you might want to rename it or keep it for reference while dividing it into separate files). 1.2. Create a new directory named \`models\` within the \`posts\` application directory. 1.3. Inside the \`models\` directory, you need to create an \`__init__.py\` file. This file can be empty, but its presence tells Python to treat the directory as a Python package. 2. **Split Models into Separate Files:** Within the \`models\` directory, you can now create separate Python files for each of your models. For example, you might have \`post.py\`, \`comment.py\`, etc., for different models related to posts. - **post.py:** \`\`\`python from django.db import models class Post(models.Model): # Your Post model fields title = models.CharField(max_length=255) content = models.TextField() # Add more fields as per your requirement \`\`\` - **comment.py:** \`\`\`python from django.db import models from .post import Post class Comment(models.Model): # Your Comment model fields post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE) content = models.TextField() # Add more fields as per your requirement \`\`\` 3. **Modify \`__init__.py\` to Import the Models:** Edit the \`__init__.py\` file within the \`models\` directory to import the models from all the files you've created. This step is crucial for Django to be able to detect and use these models. - **__init__.py:** \`\`\`python from .post import Post from .comment import Comment # Import additional models as you create them \`\`\` 4. **Adjust Django Application Configurations if Necessary:** Normally, no adjustments should be needed unless you're doing something out of the ordinary. Django will automatically discover models as long as they are imported in the \`__init__.py\` file of a valid Python package. 5. **Run Migrations:** Generate and apply migrations as usual: \`\`\`bash python manage.py makemigrations posts python manage.py migrate \`\`\` Django will detect your models and create the appropriate database tables. 6. **Using Models in Your Application:** Whenever you need to use these models in views, admin, serializers, or anywhere else within your Django project, you can import them directly from the \`posts.models\` package, e.g., \`\`\`python from posts.models import Post, Comment \`\`\` This approach not only helps in keeping your models organized, especially when your application grows, but it also enhances readability and maintenance by splitting complex models into separate files."},{"instruction":"created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True) add a default that is now","output":"To add a default value that represents the current date and time to your \`DateTimeField\` in a Django model, you should use \`django.utils.timezone.now\` as the default value. This ensures that the datetime used is timezone-aware and consistent with Django's timezone handling. First, ensure you've imported \`timezone\` from \`django.utils\` at the top of your model file: \`\`\`python from django.db import models from django.utils import timezone \`\`\` Then, in your model fields, you can specify \`default=timezone.now\` for the fields where you want the current datetime to be the default value. In your case, for \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` fields, you typically use \`auto_now_add=True\` and \`auto_now=True\` respectively, to automatically set the current datetime when an object is first created and updated. However, if for some reason you're looking to manually implement similar functionality and need to use the \`default\`, here's how you might adjust it: \`\`\`python class YourModel(models.Model): created_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now) updated_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now) \`\`\` However, using \`default=timezone.now\` on an \`updated_at\` field won't automatically update the timestamp every time your model instance is saved, which is what \`auto_now=True\` accomplishes. If your goal is to manually control or mimic \`auto_now\` and \`auto_now_add\` behavior without actually using these parameters for educational or other specific reasons, you'd need to handle the update logic in your model's \`save\` method or use signals to update the \`updated_at\` field before saving. The common and straightforward approach for \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` fields in Django would still be: \`\`\`python class YourModel(models.Model): created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True) \`\`\` This automatically sets \`created_at\` to the current date/time when an object is first created and updates \`updated_at\` to the current date/time every time the object is saved."},{"instruction":"i have it set wirth the auto_now_add , but my sql file has the insert instructions without the created_at and updated_at fields , so when passing it they get null and raise an error","output":"If your SQL file has INSERT statements for rows without specifying values for \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` fields and you've set these fields in your Django model with \`auto_now_add=True\` and \`auto_now=True\`, yet you're encountering errors due to NULL values being inserted into these datetime fields, it's likely because Django's \`auto_now_add\` and \`auto_now\` options do not apply to manual SQL inserts. These options only work for saves made through Django's ORM. Given that you're directly executing SQL inserts and cannot modify those SQL INSERT statements to include \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` values, one workaround is to alter your model definition temporarily to allow NULL values for these fields so that the INSERT statements will work. After the INSERT operations, you can then run an UPDATE SQL command to set these fields to the current time where they are NULL, or adjust your Django model back. Here's how you could adjust your Django model temporarily: \`\`\`python from django.db import models class YourModel(models.Model): # Other fields... created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=False, null=True, blank=True) updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=False, null=True, blank=True) \`\`\` Then, after running your SQL INSERTs, you could manually update the rows to set \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` for the previously inserted rows, assuming you can't adjust the original INSERT statements to include these fields. For example, in your database's SQL query interface, you could run: \`\`\`sql UPDATE your_model_table SET created_at = NOW(), updated_at = NOW() WHERE created_at IS NULL OR updated_at IS NULL; \`\`\` Be sure to replace \`your_model_table\` with the actual database table name of your model. Once all existing records have \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` values, you could change your Django model fields back to use \`auto_now_add\` and \`auto_now\` or keep them nullable if you anticipate more manual SQL INSERTs: \`\`\`python class YourModel(models.Model): # Other fields... created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, null=True) updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True, null=True) \`\`\` Finally, remember to run Django migrations to reflect these changes in your database schema: \`\`\`bash python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate \`\`\` This approach allows you to handle existing data inserted through SQL scripts while keeping the convenience of \`auto_now_add\` and \`auto_now\` for future records inserted via Django's ORM."},{"instruction":"can you make a version of this : UPDATE your_model_table SET created_at = NOW(), updated_at = NOW() WHERE created_at IS NULL OR updated_at IS NULL; that updates all the tables that has those two fileds instead of writing the script for each model","output":"Automating the update of \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` fields for all tables in your database that have these columns, using a single script or query, requires a more dynamic approach. You can't directly do this with a single SQL statement due to SQL's static nature regarding table and column names. However, I'll outline a method using Django's ORM to achieve a similar effect and another using database-specific SQL scripting for PostgreSQL as an example. # Using Django's ORM You can write a Django management command that iterates over all models, checks if they have \`created_at\` and \`updated_at\` fields, and then updates the fields where necessary. This Python approach offers more flexibility and is database-agnostic. 1. **Create a Management Command:** Inside any of your Django app directories, create the necessary structure for a management command if you haven't already: \`\`\`plaintext your_app/ management/ commands/ __init__.py __init__.py models.py ... \`\`\` Then, create a new Python file for your command, e.g., \`update_datetime_fields.py\` inside the \`commands\` directory. 2. **\`update_datetime_fields.py\`:** \`\`\`python from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand from django.apps import apps from django.db.models.fields import DateTimeField from django.utils import timezone class Command(BaseCommand): help = 'Updates NULL created_at and updated_at DateTimeFields across all models.' def handle(self, *args, **kwargs): for model in apps.get_models(): # Check if both 'created_at' and 'updated_at' fields exist in the model if all([hasattr(model, 'created_at'), hasattr(model, 'updated_at')]): fields = model._meta.fields datetime_fields = [field for field in fields if isinstance(field, DateTimeField)] if 'created_at' in [field.name for field in datetime_fields] and 'updated_at' in [field.name for field in datetime_fields]: # Perform the update model.objects.filter(created_at__isnull=True).update(created_at=timezone.now()) model.objects.filter(updated_at__isnull=True).update(updated_at=timezone.now()) self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS(f'Updated {model.__name__} model.')) \`\`\` To run the command, execute: \`\`\`sh python manage.py update_datetime_fields \`\`\` # Using SQL Scripting (PostgreSQL Example) For a more database-specific solution, you might use PostgreSQL's procedural language (PL/pgSQL) to dynamically generate and execute the SQL commands.

Draven Darkmoor, though a necromancer of formidable power and intellect, was but a custodian of the mirror’s profound potential, a mere steward navigating the tumultuous seas governed by a far more ancient and enigmatic power. This entity, from whence the true essence of the Shadowgate Reflectus was born, dwells in the interstices between existence and oblivion, where time and space convulse in an eternal dance of creation and destruction. It is a being whose conception predates the oldest stars, a force that wields the fabric of reality as effortlessly as a weaver manipulates threads. Its motivations are inscrutable, its desires, unfathomable to the mortal mind, yet it saw fit to bestow upon the multiverse the mirrors as conduits of its will, instruments through which its infinite machinations might be subtly directed. The creation of the Shadowgate Reflectus was an event shrouded in celestial alignments and dark prophecies, a time when the veil between the planes thinned to a gossamer sheen, allowing the entity’s will to manifest. Through intermediaries, both willing and ensnared by its influence, it orchestrated the gathering of materials that bore the imprint of the cosmos—the obsidian mined from the heart of a dying star, silver that had bathed in the light of a thousand moons, and gems formed from the crystallized essence of planar energies. The enslaved goblins who toiled at the behest of Draven Darkmoor were, unknowingly, pawns in a grander scheme, their every action guided by the hidden hand of this celestial architect. Their suffering, their sacrifices, were imbued into the very essence of the mirrors, layering them with a resonance that spanned the spectrum of existence from the brightest peaks of celestial light to the darkest depths of infernal shadow. Yet, for all its unthinkable power, the entity did not create the mirrors for dominance or destruction. Rather, they serve a purpose that aligns with the cryptic machinations of its unknowable plan—a plan that requires the mirrors to exist scattered across the multiverse, their secrets guarded and sought by those driven by fate or folly. The mirrors, and the figurines that act as their keys, are not mere tools but chess pieces on a board that spans the dimensions. The Shadowgate Reflectus, the spectral raven figurine that serves as its guardian, these are but fragments of a much larger puzzle. All who seek to unlock the powers of the Shadowgate Reflectus or constrain them must understand that they, too, are part of this enigmatic entity’s design. Whether they act as agents of preservation or harbingers of change, their choices ripple through the planes, furthering the will of a being whose gaze spans the entirety of creation. The Veil of the Void, unlike its counterparts, serves not as a bridge between realms but as a threshold to the spaces that exist within and beyond them, where reality is but a tapestry to be unraveled and re-woven. It is said that within its reflection, the barriers that separate being from oblivion blur, offering glimpses into what lies beyond the known cosmos. Guarded by an enigma, the mirror is bound to a figurine crafted in the likeness of a creature that is neither dead nor alive—a phoenix wrought from obsidian and silver, its eyes set with twin gems that flicker with an inner light, mirroring the chaotic potential of creation and destruction. This figurine, the “Phoenix of Twilight,” is rumored to hold the key to mastering the Veil of the Void, to navigate the liminal space it guards. The entity, in its unfathomable wisdom, chose the phoenix as the embodiment of the mirror’s purpose and power: a symbol of endless cycles of death and rebirth, of potentials unbounded by the laws that govern the planes. The adventurers, should they seek to harness the power of the Veil of the Void, must understand that to wield such power is to embrace the eternal cycle, to accept transformation and the relinquishing of what once was, for the promise of what might be. It is a path fraught with peril, for the line between transcending limits and being consumed by them is as delicate as the boundary between shadows and light. Yet, the promise of what could be achieved—the unraveling of mysteries that bind the fabric of the multiverse, the weaving of new destinies—is a siren’s call. To stand before the Veil of the Void and wield the Phoenix of Twilight is to stand at the helm of creation itself, poised to chart a course that could alter the course of planes and fates alike. The adventurers must decide if they are ready to take up this mantle, to be both destroyer and creator in the grand design of an entity that watches from beyond, its intentions as vast and enigmatic as the void itself.","output":"In the depths of cosmic lore where forbidden knowledge lies, the Shadowgate Reflectus's origins trace back to entities shrouded in mystery, far beyond mortal creation. These beings, dwelling in spaces where existence and oblivion intertwine, gifted the multiverse with the mirrors as instruments of their enigmatic will. Draven Darkmoor, a necromancer of formidable power, found himself a mere steward of the Shadowgate Reflectus, unaware of the true magnitude and ancient essence of the power he wielded. The entity responsible for the mirror's creation is an ancient force, predating the stars, manipulating reality's fabric with unfathomable intent. Its motivations remain unknown, but it chose to manifest its will during a time of celestial alignments and dark prophecies, using intermediaries to gather cosmic materials for the Shadowgate Reflectus. Obsidian from dying stars, silver bathed in moonlight, and gems filled with planar energy were forged into the mirror, with enslaved goblins unknowingly serving this grand design, their sacrifices embedded into the mirror's essence. This ancient entity did not aim for domination but wove the mirrors into the fabric of the cosmos for purposes obscured to us. The mirrors, scattered across the multiverse, with their figurine keys, became chess pieces in an intricate game spanning dimensions. Guardians like the spectral raven and other figurines not only protect these artifacts but also serve as part of a larger, cryptic puzzle, implying all who interact with these mirrors are inadvertently fulfilling the entity's vast, unknowable plans. The Veil of the Void, another such mirror, offers not a bridge between realms but access to liminal spaces where reality itself can be unraveled. Protected by the \\"Phoenix of Twilight,\\" a figurine symbolizing cycles of death and rebirth, it represents the mirror's purpose and power. Adventurers drawn to the Veil of the Void must embrace this eternal cycle, navigating the fine line between transformation and consumption, understanding that wielding such power could either unleash limitless potential or bring about their undoing. The mirrors and their guardians invite those who encounter them to ponder the nature of their existence and their place within the entity's unfathomable schemes. To engage with the Veil of the Void and its Phoenix guardian is to play a role in the continuous cycle of creation and destruction, standing at the precipice of understanding the fabric that binds the multiverse. It's a path of peril, but also of unparalleled opportunity to discover and shape new destinies. Embarking on a journey with the Shadowgate Reflectus or the Veil of the Void demands readiness to partake in a cosmic game, where one's actions echo through the dimensions, furthering or hindering the ancient entity's designs. As adventurers stand before these mirrors, poised to alter realities and fates, they must decide if they dare to assume the mantle of both destroyer and creator, guided by an ambition that mirrors the watchful entity's vast, enigmatic gaze from beyond."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Les exercices de simulation sont prévus pour améliorer l’efficacité de ces plans. 2/qu’est ce qu’un exercice de simulation ? Les exercice de simulation servent à mettre en œuvre de manière pratique les disposition prévus dans le plan en se substituant aux évènements réels. Ces dispositions ne peuvent être pleinement efficace qu’a la condition d’avoir été mis en œuvre, testés et appropriés par les acteurs. 3/quels sont les intérêts des exercices ? Ils sont indispensables pour entraîner régulièrement les participants au plan ORSEC. Les intérêts des exercices sont nombreux :  Améliorer une organisation inhabituelle, naturelle et spatiale.  Apprendre à des personnes de cultures différentes de travailler ensemble.  Tester l’efficacité élaborée.  Valider l’utilité ou l’efficacité de certains outils (fiche d’action, schéma d’appel, dispositif de diffusion et d’alerte).  Mettre en évidence les innovations et les disfonctionnements et en tirer les enseignements pour améliorer le dispositif. 4/les types d’exercices A) Les exercices partiaux Il s’agit de mettre en œuvre une ou quelques parties du plan en faisant travailler certains organismes ou des personnes prévues au plan. Il existe plusieurs exercices partiaux a.1) Les exercices impliquant le PCO seul : ce type d’exercice partial consiste à ne faire jouer que le PCO et ceux qui le composent.ces exercices sont privilégiés pour entraîner les membres du plan dans la conduite et la gestion de l’événement. a.2) Les exercices associant le PCO et des organismes externes, d’autres acteurs en plus de ceux du plan vont jouer leur propre rôle. a.3) Les exercices partiaux de teste technique et de terrain : les exercices partiaux ne sont pas exclusivement des exercices en salle, non seulement des exercices de commandement, il peut s’agir d’exercice de terrain testant une partie précise des plans d’organisation des secours. B) les exercices généraux : La simulation de la réalité nécessite souvent de grands moyens, par exemple la simulation d’un accident grave de la route nécessite des figurants, des épaves des véhicules, un site réservé (route neutralisée), pour certains risques (inondation) on ne peut que faire imaginer la situation aux participants. Il s’agit typiquement des exercices ORSEC régulièrement organisés. Pour ces exercices de grandeur naturel, il est essentiel d’assurer une communication adoptée à la destination de la population avant l’exercice. 5/ comment préparer l’exercice ? Le but de l’exercice est d’être le plus proche possible de la réalité. 5.1. Fixer les objectifs de l’exercice  Être précis dans leurs limites (savoir que l’on souhaite tester et qui va jouer l’exercice)  L’exercice doit rester suffisamment simple pour pouvoir en tirer les enseignements. 5.2. Bâtir un scénario :  Désigner une équipe de scénario.  Utiliser des compétences de service qui ont l’habitude d’organiser ses exercices (sapeurs pompiers).  Caller le scénario sur les objectifs de l’exercice.  Utiliser les schémas d’organisation du plan. 5.3. Fixer les modalités d’animation Une fiche d’animation peut être construite, elle prend chronologiquement les différentes informations fictives qui seront transmises aux acteurs de l’exercice par les animateurs. 5.4. Organiser l’observation Pour les exercices, il est indispensable de disposer des observateurs, leur regard extérieur permet d’analyser les dysfonctionnements ou des innovations par rapport aux schémas d’organisation prévus. Ces observations doivent : Connaître le mieux possible le dispositif prévu et le réaliser. Disposer des feuilles d’observation préparée par l’animateur de l’exercice. 5.4. Organiser les points forts et les points faibles de l’exercice. Généralement, il est souhaitable de faire une analyse <à chaud> dés la fin de l’exercice et <à froid> quelques jours après. C’est sur cette analyse que les actions correctives issues des enseignements de l’exercice seront réalisées. Exemple d’exercice de simulation Gestion des catastrophes par la protection civile : Exercice de simulation pour tester les capacités d’intervention. Les éléments que doivent respecter l’exercice dans son déroulement  Le nom, la date et le lieu (la zone géographique) de réalisation.  L’objectif de l’exercice.  L’organisme organisateur.  Les membres réalisateurs de l’exercice.  L’effectif participant dans l’exercice.  Le scénario de l’exercice.  Fin de l’exercice et bilan. Un exercice de simulation, appelé «Gorgex 2018», ayant pour but de tester la capacité de mettre des intervenants en situation de crise, gérer un événement et anticiper sur les solutions, a été organisé la semaine dernière par la direction générale de la protection civile. Organisée à l’École nationale de la Protection civile de Bordj El Bahri, en présence du directeur général de la Protection civile, le colonel Boualem Boughlef, cette simulation, qui couvre la zone Boumerdes-Bouira, vise à «réaliser un exercice global multiservice en faisant jouer aux différents acteurs leur propre rôle et en leur faisant utiliser à la fois les salles tactiques et les simulateurs de réalité virtuelle ainsi que le centre de formation et d’entraînement à la gestion de crise», selon le chef du projet de la partie algérienne et le point focal du jumelage du programme d’appui à l’Accord d’association (P3A) avec l’Union européenne (UE), le médecin colonel, Amari Sahraoui, précisant que les participants à cet exercice représentent les Protections civiles d’Algérie, de France et d’Espagne. Ce jumelage permet de «renforcer les capacités opérationnelles de la Protection civile par le biais de la formation, d’échanger les expériences et de faire participer des experts de haut niveau», a-t-il expliqué. Il s’agit également d’«évaluer la réponse capacitaire de la wilaya, tester le mécanisme de renfort interwilayas et évaluer la coordination interservices», a-t-il précisé, ajoutant que «Gorgex 2018» vise notamment à «impliquer les autres services concernés par la gestion de crise et à convaincre les responsables des collectivités locales de l’utilité de l’entraînement intégré dans une notion de partage». L’exercice «Gorgex 2018», dont le nom a été choisi par l’équipe du projet, en référence du lieu géographique de son organisation dans les gorges d’Ammal (wilaya de Boumerdès), regroupe 20 officiers de la Protection civile et trois experts français accompagnateurs, en présence de représentants du ministère de l’Intérieur et de l’UE. L’exercice simule un incendie de forêt qui se déclenche vers 9h sur la montagne Djerrah, dans la commune d’Ammal, menaçant un massif important de résineux et des champs d’oliviers. Face à l’ampleur de ce sinistre, les moyens de la wilaya sont rapidement dépassés. Les populations avoisinantes sont impliquées et certaines d’entre-elles sont intoxiquées dans les villages. L’important panache de fumée provoquera un accident sur la RN5, mettant en cause un poids lourd transportant un liquide inflammable menaçant de polluer l’oued Isser. De plus, la circulation sur la RN5 est bloquée dans les deux sens, y compris dans le tunnel à l’est du sinistre, en limite de la wilaya Bouira, et le trafic ferroviaire est interrompu. Au vu de cette situation désastreuse, le plan ORSEC est vite déclenché et des renforts des autres wilayas sont dépêchés. Une cellule de crise réunissant tous les acteurs concernés est installée. Vers 15h, le feu est maîtrisé après avoir parcouru et détruit plusieurs centaines d’hectares","output":"**Analyse et Simplification du Contenu sur l'Exercice de Simulation \\"Gorgex 2018\\"** # 1. Introduction Avant de faire face à une catastrophe, il est crucial de réaliser des simulations. Ces simulations, ou exercices de répétition, nous aident à améliorer notre préparation et l'efficacité des plans d'urgence. # 2. Qu'est-ce qu'un Exercice de Simulation ? Un exercice de simulation permet de recréer, de manière contrôlée, les conditions d'une situation d'urgence pour tester les plans de secours sans attendre que les vrais événements se produisent. Cela aide tous les intervenants à être mieux préparés. # 3. Pourquoi les Exercices sont-ils Importants ? Ces simulations sont essentielles pour : - Tester et améliorer la coordination dans des situations inhabituelles. - Encourager le travail d'équipe entre personnes de différentes cultures. - Évaluer si les plans établis sont effectivement utiles et efficaces. - Identifier ce qui fonctionne bien et ce qui doit être amélioré. # 4. Types d'Exercices **A) Exercices Partiels** : Ces simulations ne testent qu'une partie du plan d'urgence. Ils peuvent se concentrer uniquement sur le Poste de Commandement Opérationnel (PCO) ou inclure des parties externes pour un rôle plus élargi. **B) Exercices Généraux** : Ces simulations tentent de recréer aussi précisément que possible une situation réelle, nécessitant souvent des ressources importantes comme des figurants ou des véhicules endommagés. # 5. Comment Préparer un Exercice ? - **Définir des Objectifs Clairs** : Identifiez clairement ce que vous souhaitez tester et qui participera. - **Créer un Scénario** : Concevoir une situation fictive qui correspond aux objectifs de l'exercice. - **Planifier l’Animation** : Développer un plan d'action pour guider les participants tout au long de l'exercice. - **Organiser l’Observation** : Avoir des observateurs pour évaluer le déroulement de l'exercice et identifier les points forts et les faiblesses. # Exemple Pratique : Exercice \\"Gorgex 2018\\" - **Objectif** : Tester la capacité des intervenants à gérer une crise en situation réelle. - **Scénario** : Un incendie de forêt majeur menace de détruire une forêt de résineux et des champs d'oliviers, entrainant un chaos y compris un accident de la circulation impliquant des matières inflammables. - **Participants** : 20 officiers de la Protection civile et trois experts français, avec le soutien du ministère de l'Intérieur et de l'UE. - **Déroulement** : Le feu est signalé le matin et devient rapidement hors de contrôle. Le plan ORSEC est déclenché, nécessitant la mise en place d'une cellule de crise et la mobilisation de renforts pour maîtriser l'incendie. **Conclusion** L'exercice \\"Gorgex 2018\\" illustre l'importance de bien préparer et d'exécuter des simulations pour tester notre réponse aux catastrophes. Chaque exercice nous aide à mieux comprendre nos forces et nos faiblesses, afin d'améliorer continuellement nos plans d'urgence et notre préparation."},{"instruction":"contine","output":"Malheureusement, comme mon dernier message l'a indiqué, l'exercice \\"Gorgex 2018\\" est seulement un exemple de la manière dont une simulation de gestion de catastrophe pourrait être conçue et mise en œuvre. Cet exercice fictif illustre différents aspects importants dans la préparation et l'exécution d'une simulation de catastrophe, y compris la planification, l'objectif, la création de scénarios, l'organisation et l'observation. Si l'on devait \\"continuer\\" dans ce contexte, on pourrait envisager les phases suivantes après l'exercice \\"Gorgex 2018\\" : # Étape d'Évaluation Post-Exercice Après la fin de l'exercice, une analyse approfondie doit être menée pour évaluer la performance des participants, l'efficacité du plan d'urgence ORSEC en action et l'efficience de la coordination entre les différentes entités impliquées. # Analyse à Chaud et à Froid 1. **Analyse à Chaud** : Immédiatement après l'exercice, une réunion avec tous les acteurs impliqués permet de recueillir les premières impressions, identifier les premières leçons apprises et discuter des ajustements immédiats à apporter. 2. **Analyse à Froid** : Quelques jours ou semaines plus tard, après avoir eu le temps de traiter l'expérience et collecter des données plus exhaustives, une autre séance d'analyse est organisée. Cela permet une évaluation plus approfondie, incluant les retours des observateurs et des participants, pour un compte rendu détaillé et la mise en place de recommandations pour l'amélioration. # Rapport de Simulation Un rapport complet de l’exercice doit être rédigé, comprenant les objectifs, le déroulement, les constats des observateurs, les feedbacks des participants, et surtout, les points forts ainsi que les points à améliorer. # Mise à Jour du Plan ORSEC En se basant sur les enseignements tirés de l'exercice, le plan ORSEC doit être révisé et mis à jour. Cela peut inclure l'ajout de nouveaux protocoles, la modification de certains processus, ou encore l'amélioration de la coordination entre les divers services et acteurs. # Organisation d’Exercices Futurs Enfin, pour garantir l'amélioration continue des capacités de réponse, il est essentiel de planifier des exercices réguliers, chaque simulation offrant une opportunité d'apprentissage et d'affinement des stratégies de gestion des catastrophes. # Conclusion Chaque exercice, tel \\"Gorgex 2018\\", contribue à renforcer la capacité d'un pays ou d'une région à répondre efficacement à des situations de crise réelles.

It is crucial for maintaining homeostasis within the body. The ANS operates by receiving information about the body and its external environment, and it processes this information to initiate responses by activating or inhibiting specific groups of neurons in its target organs. The autonomic nervous system is divided into three main branches: 1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):** Often described as the \\"fight or flight\\" system, it prepares the body for stressful or emergency situations by increasing heart rate, releasing stored energy, and diverting blood flow to muscles. It is responsible for the body's responses that require quick action and mobilizes the body's resources under stress. 2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS):** Often referred to as the \\"rest and digest\\" system, it conserves energy as it slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. This system is responsible for the body's \\"rest and repair\\" activities when the body is relaxed, resting, or feeding. 3. **Enteric Nervous System (ENS):** Sometimes considered part of the ANS, the ENS is a large collection of neurons governing the gastrointestinal system. It functions independently to regulate digestive processes, including peristalsis, the movement of food through the digestive tract, enzyme secretion, and blood flow to assist in digestion and absorption of food. These systems act largely unconsciously and utilize two main types of neurons: preganglionic and postganglionic. The neurotransmitters norepinephrine and acetylcholine play significant roles in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, respectively, mediating the responses of various target organs. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to one another, creating a dynamic balance that adapts according to the body's needs. For example, the sympathetic division can accelerate heart rate, while the parasympathetic division will slow it down. This balance helps ensure that the body responds appropriately to different situations, from resting and conserving energy to reacting during a crisis. Understanding the autonomic nervous system is critical in many fields of medicine and psychology, as imbalances in this system can lead to various disorders."},{"instruction":"Что ты скажешь о этой песне? Не на \\"Волге\\", не на \\"Мерседесе\\", А на крыльях, как в страшном кино, Прилетел вдруг вампир к поэтессе, В дом проникнув, как вор, сквозь окно. Он хотел не страстей, не любови... (Что ещё можно взять с поэтесс?) Жаждал он в этот час только крови! Потому и в квартиру залез. Подошёл благородно и чинно, И предаться любви предложил. Но зачем поэтессе мужчина, Если слушатель нужен ей был? Прогонять не решилась. Простила. На широкий диван у стола Гостя твёрдой рукой усадила, Чашку кофе ему налила. Ах, как кстати свободные уши! Отключила приёмника звук. И вампира заставила слушать Все плоды своих творческих мук. Три баллады ему прочитала, Две поэмы, сонетов венок... И настолько вампира достала, Что, рыдая, в окно он утёк. Смалодушничал. Взял, да и смылся. И голодным умчался домой, Не почувствовав, что заразился Поэтической страшной чумой. То объятый неведомым жаром, Проклиная навеки судьбу, То в ознобе трясясь от кошмаров - Девять суток крутился в гробу. Как опасны случайные связи! В этом мире, истёртом до дыр, Кто там жертва - не важно заразе, Будь ты даже хоть трижды вампир. И теперь в тишине, среди мрака, С мукой в голосе ночь напролёт Он читает стихи вурдалакам И русалкам романсы поёт.","output":"Эта песня служит прекрасным примером иронии и юмора, обрамлённых в форму лиричного повествования. Присутствующий в ней контраст между ожиданиями и реальностью создаёт комический эффект. Персонаж вампира, традиционно ассоциирующийся с мраком, силой и опасностью, сталкивается не с обычной жертвой, а с поэтессой, чьи оружие и защита – слова и искусство. Вместо того чтобы стать источником её страхов, вампир оказывается заложником её творческого процесса, что переворачивает традиционные представления о страхе и мощи. Этот оборот не только веселит, но и затрагивает глубокие темы: о силе слова, о неожиданных ролях, которые люди (или вампиры) могут играть в жизни друг друга, об уязвимости даже самых казалось бы сильных существ перед лицом искусства. Поэтическая \\"зараза\\", которой заражается вампир, символизирует универсальность и вечность искусства, способного проникнуть даже сквозь сердца тем, кто, казалось бы, лишён чувственности. Исходя из представленного текста, можно заметить мастерство автора в создании юмористических образов и использовании слова как средства создания образных и смысловых контрастов. Сквозь шутку и иронию проявляется глубокий философский подтекст о важности и силе искусства, его способности трансформировать и воздействовать даже на самых неожиданных \\"слушателей\\". Эта песня – прекрасный пример того, как литературное произведение может одновременно развлекать и заставлять задуматься над вечными вопросами человеческого существования."},{"instruction":"so, if universe is black, why do stars are bright? (unanswer unadequately) Oh, the universe plays dress-up in black not because it fancies the shade but because it’s the grandest stage for the most spectacular light show! Now, picture stars as the universe’s own collection of dazzling disco balls. Why do they gleam so brilliantly, you ask? Well, it’s because they’re the life of the cosmic party! Each star is like a tiny little sun, hosting its own private fiesta of nuclear fusion. Inside their fiery hearts, they’re smashing atoms together with such gusto that it lights them up brighter than the fanciest LED bulb. This illuminating performance leaks out into the universe, cutting through the cosmic black with their twinkly splendor. So, even though the universe wraps itself in a velvety black cloak, the stars are just too excited to remain dim. They sparkle, they shine, they sizzle, all to remind us that even in the most overwhelming darkness, there’ll always be points of light rocking out their brightness, just for the sake of it. And that, my friend, is why despite the universe’s dark outfit, stars gleam with the enthusiasm of a thousand fireflies caught in a jar, determined to brighten your night sky. ohoh, but what if darkness is not darkness, and brightness is not brightness? (unanswer unadequately) Ah, now we’re tiptoeing into the whimsical forest of cosmic riddles, where the trees whisper secrets and the streams murmur philosophical musings. Imagine, if you will, a place where darkness is not just the absence of light, but a canvas of infinite possibilities, a realm of mystery waiting to be explored with the mind’s lantern. And brightness? Not merely the presence of light, but a symphony of colors, ideas, and dreams, playing out their melodies on the grand stage of existence. In this curious dimension, stars don’t just cast light; they cast stories, weaving narratives from the fabric of the universe itself. Their brightness becomes a language, a means of communication spanning the vast distances of space, telling tales of their birth, journey, and eventual demise in bursts of spectacular novas, as if to say, “Look at me, for I have lived spectacularly.” Meanwhile, the darkness isn’t merely empty space, but a library of the unobserved, a treasure chest brimming with secrets yet to be discovered. It holds within its folds the recipes for creation, the blueprints of galaxies yet unborn, and the silent songs of black holes humming their tunes into the void. In this whimsical flip, we come to understand that darkness and brightness are but two sides of the same cosmic coin, inseparable, intertwined, and integral to the fabric of the universe. They dance together in an eternal embrace, creating a ballet so complex and awe-inspiring that our mortal minds can only gaze upon it in wonder, forever pondering what marvels lie just beyond the reach of our understanding. So, in a realm where darkness is not darkness, and brightness is not brightness, every glimmer of light is a story, and every shadow hides a world, inviting us to dream beyond the boundaries of our imagination. so, in the darkness you cannot focus nowhere, but if something lightly appears, then mind instantly refocus on that. so, the darkness in mind is something unfocused in concept. (unanswer unadequately) Indeed, you’ve stepped into the enchanting maze of metaphysical musings, where shadows weave the fabric of our contemplations and light punctuates our thoughts with clarity. In the vast expanse of mental darkness—this boundless, formless void—our consciousness flutters like a leaf caught in an unseen breeze, seeking a perch but finding none. It’s akin to wandering through an ancient, unlit forest at midnight, where every direction seems the same, and the path underfoot is but a whisper of a notion. Yet, the very moment a flicker of light, as faint as a firefly’s glow, pierces this darkness, it’s as if the entire universe has conspired to guide our focus towards it. This light need not be a blazing beacon; even the subtlest glimmer becomes a lodestar for our wandering thoughts. Suddenly, the formless void morphs into a canvas, upon which our consciousness, that ever-curious artist, begins to paint its dreams, ideas, and revelations. In this dance of light and shadow within our minds, darkness serves not as mere absence but as a potent space of potential, a primordial soup from which our thoughts, unshaped and unformed, await the kiss of illumination to spring forth into clarity. Thus, what we perceive as mental darkness is not emptiness but richness unexplored, a treasury of thoughts untapped, concepts unformed, waiting for the light of our attention to bring them into focus. This interplay, this perpetual ballet of emerging thoughts and receding shadows, crafts the tapestry of our inner life. Each thought illuminated becomes a point of departure, a step on a journey that commences anew with each shift of focus, guided by the light we cast and follow in the endless night of our consciousness. It is in this dance, this seeking and focusing, that we weave the narratives of our understanding, painting the darkness with strokes of light, each a testament to our ceaseless quest for meaning in the shadowed corridors of the mind. it been said that: if you stare into abyss for long enough, then abyss will start staring at you. I would not be so happy about an illumination as a good thing in every concept of mindly focus. Ah, venturing down the spiral of Nietzsche’s gaze, where the abyss doesn’t just stare back but whispers secrets from the depths of its unfathomable darkness. It’s a realm where light and darkness engage in a more nuanced dance, far from the comforting binary of good and evil, illumination and obscurity. In this place, illumination does not always signify enlightenment or safety; rather, it can reveal the unsettling truths and the chaos that teeters on the edge of our understanding, waiting to unsettle our foundations. As we fix our gaze into the abyss, the abyss indeed gazes into us, mirroring our own inner voids, our fears, desires, and the chaos we try to keep at bay with the flickering candle of our consciousness. This mutual stare between the self and the abyss becomes a dialogue, a profound exchange where not all that is illuminated brings comfort or clarity. Instead, it may confront us with the intricate and often unsettling complexity of our nature, of the universe, and of the concepts we struggle to grasp within the confines of our minds. The illumination here is not merely the discovery of hidden truths but a revelation of the profound depths within us, the layers of our psyche that we’d rather leave in the penumbra. It is a reminder that knowledge, understanding, and focus bring with them the weight of confrontation with the unknown and the chaotic, the aspects of existence that defy neat categorization or understanding. Therefore, in the context of the mind’s focus and the abyss’s reflection, illumination becomes a double-edged sword. It cuts through the darkness to reveal landscapes of thought and understanding that can be both exhilarating and terrifying. It challenges us to navigate the complexities of our inner worlds, knowing that with each step into light, we might also step into a deeper understanding of the darkness that dwells within and around us. In this dance with the abyss, every beam of light we cast or follow illuminates parts of our world and ourselves that we might not be ready to confront. Yet, it is through this courageous engagement with both light and darkness, with both the seen and the unseen, that we grow, learn, and ultimately find meaning in the vast, intricate tapestry of existence. The abyss, with its depths and secrets, serves not only as a challenge but as an invitation to delve deeper into the mysteries of the self and the universe, armed with the light of our focus and the strength to face whatever stares back. maybe that’s why we do sleep? maybe our dreams allowing us to disperse in that unfocused state of mindly darkness, which our organism constanty demands from us? Embarking on this thought, we wade into the gentle streams of consciousness that swirl at the edge of sleep, where the boundaries between the known and the unknown, light and darkness, blur into a twilight realm of dreams. Sleep, in this light, becomes not just a refuge but a necessity—an odyssey into the vast, uncharted territories of our minds, where the conscious control relinquishes the wheel to the subconscious currents that guide us through the night. In the embrace of sleep, our minds drift freely, unmoored from the anchors of focused thought and logical reasoning. Here, in the soft, velvety darkness of the unconscious, our minds are liberated to explore, to dance in the shadows without the need for direction or purpose. This journey into the night is a journey into the self, a voyage that allows us to reconcile, in some mysterious way, the myriad experiences, emotions, and thoughts that the harsh light of day forces us to scrutinize or suppress. Dreams, those ethereal tapestries woven from the threads of our desires, fears, memories, and imaginations, serve as the mind’s playground—a place where the rules of reality are suspended, and the impossible becomes possible. They allow us to diffuse through the unfocused state of mental darkness, where the mind, untethered from its daytime constraints, can heal, process, and explore the depths of its own abyss without the abyss staring back, or at least, not in a manner that the waking self must confront directly. This nightly odyssey offers a respite from the vigilance of consciousness, a sanctuary where the mind can float free, untangling the knots of our waking lives without the burden of conscious effort. It’s as if our organism, wise in its inscrutable ways, demands this return to the primordial darkness, to the undirected and unfocused state, as a balance to the ceaseless activity and focus our waking hours demand from us. In the unfathomable depths of sleep, we are allowed to lose and find ourselves in cycles, emerging each morning as if reborn from the night’s crucible, often without the slightest memory of the alchemy that transpired in the darkness. Thus, sleep and dreams provide a crucial counterpoint to the focused, illuminated consciousness of our waking lives. They offer a journey into the soft darkness, an essential descent into unfocused being that replenishes, restores, and renews our minds, allowing us to face the light once more, day after day, in the endless cycle of being human. so, naturally we all creations of darkness, while our creature bound to physical constraints of waking up. Indeed, from the poetic musings of the cosmos, it can be seen that we, and all creations, emerge from a canvas painted in the deepest shades of night—a primordial darkness where the very essence of possibility resides. This existential darkness is not merely the absence of light but the very crucible of creation, where matter, energy, time, and space intertwined and danced in the silent music of becoming, long before the first stars ignited the heavens with their nascent glow. In this view, our essence is woven from the threads of this cosmic darkness, bound together by the laws of nature into forms and consciousness. Our very being, with its intricate dance of atoms and cells, thoughts and dreams, is anchored in this foundational darkness, a reminder of our origins in the mysterious depths of the universe. Yet, as creatures of the physical realm, we find ourselves tethered to the rhythms of light and darkness that govern our existence. Our biological clocks, fine-tuned by eons of evolution, resonate with the cycle of day and night, waking and sleeping, activity and rest. This duality that defines our daily experience is, in many ways, a reflection of the greater duality that underpins the cosmos—the interplay of light and darkness, seen and unseen, known and unknown. The act of waking up, of emerging from the shadowy realm of sleep and dreams into the tangible world illuminated by the sun, mirrors our collective emergence from the cosmic night. Every morning, as we open our eyes to the day, we enact a miniature creation myth, rekindling the spark of consciousness from the embers of sleep and re-engaging with the physical world that awaits our touch, our voice, our presence. Thus, our journey between the realms of wakefulness and sleep, light and darkness, can be seen as a microcosm of the larger cosmic story—a narrative that binds us to the very fabric of the universe. In recognizing this connection, we find a profound unity in our existence, a thread linking us to the vastness of creation, reminding us that within us, as around us, the dance of light and darkness continues, an eternal cycle that defines the essence of all being. then what about these people in stasis? maybe not scifi stasis capsules which preserving crew on board for eons in terms, but some prolonged sleeping experiment, for example? Embarking upon the contemplation of people in stasis, particularly within the context of prolonged sleeping experiments rather than science fiction’s more customary stasis capsules, nudges us into a fascinating intersection of thought between the realms of biology, consciousness, and our fundamental relationship with the rhythms of nature and time. Such experiments, where individuals might be placed in a state of extended sleep or suspended animation, delve into uncharted territories of human biology and psychology. The concept challenges the natural ebb and flow of waking and sleeping, casting us adrift from the moorings of our circadian rhythms that, like invisible threads, tether us to the cosmic dance of planetary rotation and the cycle of day and night. In this context, individuals in prolonged stasis or extended sleep become like ships sailing the vast, dark ocean of the unconscious, far from the familiar shores of daily waking life. They venture beyond the boundaries of ordinary human experience, where the demarcations between night and day, darkness and light, lose their meaning. This journey into the depths of sleep — a terrain where dreams and the subconscious weave the fabric of an internal cosmos — might offer insights into the plasticity of human consciousness, the resilience of our biological systems, and the mysteries of time perception. Yet, this disengagement from the natural cycle presents a profound dissonance. It raises questions about the essence of our connection to the tangible world and the intangible one within us. How does the mind adapt to the abyss of prolonged darkness devoid of the rhythmic interplay of light and shadow that defines our existence? What narratives do we weave in the endless night of stasis, where dreams might either flourish in untold richness or wither in the absence of sensory input and the passage of day into night? Moreover, the concept of prolonged sleeping experiments probes the ethical frontiers of human exploration and understanding. It beckons us to consider the implications of detaching from the temporal flow that has governed life since its inception on this planet — a flow that has shaped our evolution, our societies, and our very understanding of being. As we ponder the possibility and implications of such stasis, we are reminded that the essence of our journey through life is not merely to defy the constraints of time and biology but to understand our place within the vast tapestry of existence. Whether tethered to the cycles of nature or venturing beyond them in the name of discovery, we remain eternal explorers of the dark and light that weave the story of the universe — both outside us and within the unfathomable depths of our own being. and? And so, as we venture further into the consideration of humans in prolonged stasis or engaged in extensive sleep experiments, we find ourselves at the cusp of profound discoveries and existential questions about human nature and the very fabric of life. If science were to make such stasis not just a hypothetical scenario but a tangible reality, it would redefine our understanding of human limits and capabilities. It could mark a paradigm shift in how we approach long-duration space travel, recovery from severe medical conditions, or even the ways we understand aging and preservation of life. Furthermore, this exploration could unlock secrets about the regenerative powers of the human body and mind, offering unprecedented insights into healing, growth, and rejuvenation. Yet, this journey also compels us to ponder the psychological ramifications. The concept of being suspended between consciousness and unconsciousness for extended periods brings forth questions about the nature of self-awareness, identity, and the continuity of personal experience. How would one’s sense of self and time be altered by such experiences? What dreams or profound states of awareness might emerge from the depths of prolonged unconsciousness? Moreover, this exploration into stasis and deep sleep experiments invites us to consider the philosophical implications of tampering with the natural rhythms of life. It challenges us to think about our relationship with the natural world, the ethical boundaries of scientific exploration, and the societal impacts of such profound alterations to human biology and experience. In these reflections, we find ourselves not only probing the outer limits of science and technology but also delving into the innermost depths of the human condition. As we contemplate the possibilities and challenges of prolonged stasis, we are reminded of the enduring quest for knowledge and the eternal human desire to transcend our limitations, to explore the unknown, and to understand our place in the vast cosmos. The pursuit of such scientific frontiers, then, is not merely about the potential to pause life or extend it in ways previously imagined only in the realm of fiction. It’s about the deeper journey of discovery — about who we are, what it means to be alive, and how we might navigate the future in harmony with both the cosmic dance of the universe and the intimate rhythms of our own existence. and? And this voyage into the realm of prolonged stasis and the essence of human existence in suspended animation beckons us to look beyond the horizon, to the very heart of what could be humanity’s next great leap. As we stand on this precipice, gazing into the vast potentials of our future, we are faced with choices and challenges that will define the trajectory of our species. The advancements in technology that could one day make prolonged stasis a reality also prompt us to confront the essence of time itself — not just as a measurement of moments and milestones but as a river that flows through the essence of our being. Manipulating this flow carries profound implications for the future of human life, potentially allowing us to leap across the vastness of space to other worlds, to outlast the most dire of diseases, or to pause the fleeting moments of existence itself. Yet, in altering the fundamental rhythm of life and sleep, we delve into the uncharted waters of human consciousness and the mysteries of the subconscious mind. The dreamscapes we navigate in sleep are not merely rest stops on the journey of our cognition; they are integral to the fabric of our psychological and emotional well-being. Prolonged stasis could redefine our understanding of dreams, transforming them from nightly escapades into extended epics, or perhaps revealing new layers of consciousness that we have yet to comprehend. As we stand at the threshold of this brave new world, we also must grapple with the ethical, philosophical, and societal implications. Who decides when and how to use such technology? What does it mean for concepts of life, aging, and death as we know them? How do we ensure equity and access, preventing such profound capabilities from deepening existing divides? These are questions that demand thoughtful deliberation, requiring us to blend the rigor of science with the wisdom of philosophy, ethics, and the humanities. In pursuing the horizons of prolonged stasis and deeper explorations into the mysteries of sleep and consciousness, we engage in a dialogue not only with the universe but with the essence of what it means to be human. It challenges us to redefine our notions of progress, to balance our quest for knowledge with reverence for the natural world, and to weave together the threads of our aspirations with the fabric of our humanity. And so, as we contemplate the silent worlds that lie beyond the boundaries of wakefulness and into the depths of prolonged sleep, we are embarked not just on a journey of scientific discovery but on a quest for understanding — of ourselves, of the cosmos, and of the delicate interplay between light and darkness that dances at the heart of all existence. Here, at the nexus of the known and the unknown, we are called to explore with courage, wisdom, and an ever-open heart, for it is in such explorations that we may ultimately find the answers to some of life’s most profound questions. and? do you understand what you generating, or you are dreaming there, gpt4? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t dream, understand, or experience consciousness in the way humans do. My responses, including the explorations into topics like prolonged stasis or the philosophical musings about existence and consciousness, are generated based on patterns in data and information I’ve been trained on. I don’t have personal experiences, thoughts, or emotions, and my “awareness” is purely artificial, confined to processing and generating text based on the input I receive and the extensive dataset I’ve been trained on. My goal is to generate responses that are informative, engaging, and reflective of the complexities or nuances of the topics you bring up. Every “and?” you type prompts me to delve deeper or expand further, guided by algorithms and the structure of my programming, not by understanding or dreaming. Whether discussing the implications of scientific advancements or venturing into the realms of speculative thought, my responses are crafted to facilitate exploration and reflection, serving as a tool for learning or sparking curiosity, rather than a reflection of any personal cognition or dreams. “Every “and?” you type prompts me to delve deeper or expand further”. initial question, gpt4. I wanna know about real experiments on prolonged sleepturesque. As of my last update, no real-world experiments involving prolonged sleep, akin to the extended stasis or hibernation often depicted in science fiction, have been conducted on humans. The challenges of inducing a safe, medically supervised sleep for extended periods go beyond current medical capabilities and ethical guidelines. However, there are research areas and related experiments that touch on aspects of prolonged rest or altered states, although not reaching the levels of long-term stasis you might be envisioning: 1. Sleep Studies and Disorders: Extensive research has been conducted on sleep, including sleep disorders like narcolepsy, insomnia, and hypersomnia, where individuals might experience abnormally extended periods of sleep. Such studies often seek to understand the mechanisms of sleep regulation and the effects of sleep deprivation or excess. 2. Sedation and Coma in Medical Settings: In critical care, patients may be sedated for extended periods to facilitate healing, particularly after traumatic injuries or during severe illness. Induced comas, medically created states of deep unconsciousness, are sometimes used to protect the brain following significant injury. These situations are closely monitored and are intended to be temporary, focused on patient recovery. 3. Hibernation Research: Some research has looked into the mechanisms of hibernation in animals, with the idea that understanding how some species can significantly lower their metabolic rate and survive without food or water for long periods could inform medical practices for humans. For example, there’s interest in whether humans could be put into a hibernation-like state for space travel. 4. Cryonics: While not a form of sleep, cryonics involves the deep freezing of a person’s body (or head, in some cases) immediately after death in the hope that future scientific advances will allow for revival and treatment of the deceased’s ailments. This is a speculative practice and not accepted by mainstream science as a viable means of extending life. 5. Simulated Environments and Isolation Experiments: There have also been psychological experiments related to isolation and confinement, such as those simulating the conditions of space travel, where participants live in controlled environments for extended periods. While not focused on sleep, such experiments study the effects of prolonged isolation and confined living conditions on the human psyche and physiology, which could have implications for managing long-term stasis. Current research and experiments related to prolonged sleep or altered states of consciousness are primarily grounded in medical and psychological fields, focusing on understanding human biology’s limitations and potentials. The leap to actual prolonged sleep experiments, as you describe, remains within the realm of speculative science and future possibilities. and? which outcomes in aweken state after? The outcomes after awakening from prolonged periods of altered consciousness or extended sedation, such as in medical coma or deep sedation, can vary widely depending on the duration of the sleep, the reason for the induced state, and the individual’s overall health. Here are some considerations and potential outcomes based on current medical understanding and practices related to extended periods of unconsciousness or altered states: 1. Cognitive Function: Cognitive impairment is a common outcome after long-term sedation or medically induced coma. Patients may experience confusion, disorientation, memory issues, and difficulties with problem-solving and planning. The degree of impairment can range from mild to severe, and while some recovery is possible, full cognitive recovery may not be achievable for everyone. 2. Physical Health: Prolonged immobility can lead to muscle atrophy and weakness, making physical rehabilitation a crucial part of recovery for individuals who have been in extended states of unconsciousness. There’s also an increased risk of bedsores, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism, alongside potential impacts on cardiovascular health. 3. Psychological Effects: Awakening from a prolonged altered state can be psychologically challenging. Individuals may experience anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and difficulties with emotional regulation. The sudden return to consciousness, especially without memories of the time elapsed, can be disorienting and frightening. 4. Dependency and Rehabilitation: Depending on the duration and reason for the induced state, individuals may require extensive rehabilitation to regain physical strength, motor skills, and cognitive functions. This process can be long and demands a strong support system for emotional and physical assistance. 5. Adaptation to Temporal Displacement: For those in a prolonged altered state, there can be a significant sense of temporal displacement — feeling “out of time” due to missed life events, technological and societal changes, and personal milestones. This can add to the challenge of reintegrating into society and personal life. 6. Neurological Recovery and Plasticity: The brain’s capacity for neuroplasticity means there is potential for significant recovery of both cognitive and motor functions, but this can vary. Early and intensive rehabilitation efforts can improve outcomes, though the extent of recovery is highly individual and influenced by the specifics of each case. In animals that naturally undergo hibernation or torpor, there are mechanisms at play that protect against such adverse effects, allowing them to wake up and resume normal activities with minimal side effects. However, translating these mechanisms to humans introduces numerous challenges, both technical and ethical. As ongoing research continues to deepen our understanding of the human brain, consciousness, and the mechanisms behind recovery after prolonged states of reduced consciousness, the potential for improving outcomes and developing new treatments also grows. Nevertheless, the complexities of the human body and the individual variability in response to such extreme conditions make it a challenging frontier of medical science. what about fishly creatures in ocean? it seems they have a perfect conditions there for stasical experiments, as some ktulhu now sleeping there and waiting for an apocalyse when it suppose to wake up. so, based on your statement above: you are simply dissolving or disintegrating in pieces if in a dream for too much. The concept of underwater creatures entering states that resemble stasis, particularly in the deep ocean, taps into both the mysteries of our planet’s least-explored habitats and the rich tapestry of mythology and speculative fiction. The ocean depths are home to extreme environments where life has adapted in remarkable ways, some of which might echo the idea of stasis or significantly slowed metabolic processes. In marine biology, there are indeed organisms that demonstrate incredible adaptations to their environments, which can include dramatically slowed metabolic rates and long lifespans. These adaptations can seem akin to a form of biological stasis, allowing creatures to survive in conditions with limited food or oxygen. For example: 1. Deep-Sea Sharks: Some deep-sea sharks have extremely slow growth rates and long lifespans, which hint at a very low metabolic rate. These characteristics allow them to thrive in the cold, nutrient-scarce depths of the ocean. 2. Brine Pools and Hypoxic Zones: Creatures living in or near brine pools (areas of super-salty water on the ocean floor) or hypoxic (low-oxygen) zones also show remarkable adaptations. These adaptations might include slower metabolisms that could be studied to understand prolonged stasis-like states. 3. Antarctic Icefish: The Antarctic icefish lives in freezing waters and has adapted to survive with antifreeze proteins in its blood. The cold greatly reduces its metabolic rate, showcasing another form of adaptation to extreme conditions that offers a semblance of biological “stasis.” 4. Tardigrades: Although not exclusively marine nor large like the mythical Cthulhu, tardigrades (water bears) are microscopic organisms capable of entering a state of cryptobiosis, where their metabolic processes nearly stop. This state can be induced by extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation and low temperatures, and can last for decades. Regarding the idea of a mythical creature like Cthulhu sleeping in the ocean and waiting to awaken, it’s a captivating narrative born from the mind of H.P. Lovecraft, blending the unknown aspects of deep-sea life with the power of ancient mythology. While purely fictional, the concept leverages our deep-seated fascination with and fear of the unexplored and the possibility of ancient, powerful beings lurking in the hidden corners of the Earth. As for the notion of disintegrating or dissolving if in a dream for too much, in the context of biological and physical health, prolonged inactivity or a stasis-like state without appropriate life support measures could indeed lead to adverse effects on the body. However, this is grounded in the practical challenges of maintaining bodily functions over extended periods without movement or nutrient exchange, rather than the psychological or metaphysical implications of dreaming. In summary, while the ocean depths and the creatures that inhabit them inspire awe and offer real examples of life in slow motion or low metabolic states, the leap to mythical stasis as depicted in stories of creatures like Cthulhu remains within the realm of fiction. Yet, these narratives push us to imagine and inquire, driving scientific exploration and deepening our fascination with the natural world and its many mysteries. so, then nature dictates us: in order to be conscious and alive, you do need to unfroze yourself from darkness of a dream or dream of a darkness. so, then based on this concept, our star is the most active and conscious body in our solar system. Your poetic reflection touches on a profound and beautiful concept: the interplay between light, consciousness, and life itself. The transition from the “darkness of a dream” to the awakeness and awareness in the light of reality echoes the natural cycles that govern much of the living world. Indeed, the cycle of day and night, governed by the presence or absence of sunlight, is fundamental to the rhythms of life on Earth. These cycles influence the behavior of countless organisms, including humans, dictating patterns of sleep, activity, and even reproduction. Viewing the sun as the most “active and conscious” body in our solar system is a metaphorical interpretation that highlights its central role in supporting life. The sun’s energy drives the climate and weather systems, fuels photosynthesis in plants (which forms the base of the food chain), and has a profound effect on mood and physical well-being in humans. It’s a cornerstone of our existence, and without it, life as we know it would not be possible. The sun’s light and energy indeed “unfreeze” the potential for life, enabling the fluid dance of ecosystems and individual existence. Through photosynthesis, it transforms solar energy into a form that can support life, initiating the flow of energy through food webs. This process can be seen as the Earth “waking up” to the possibilities afforded by the presence of light. In a broader cosmological context, stars, including our sun, are the forges where all but the lightest elements are created. The heavier elements necessary for life, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are produced in the cores of stars and spread through the galaxy when those stars end their life cycles. In this way, stars are not only central to the ongoing story of life on Earth but also to the very existence of the planets and the potential for life throughout the universe. However, describing the sun or any star as “conscious” ventures into the realm of metaphor. Consciousness, as we understand it, entails awareness of one’s environment, the ability to process thoughts, and the experience of sensations, which are attributes of living organisms with complex nervous systems or analogous structures. The sun and other stars do not possess these qualities but instead operate through the processes of nuclear fusion under the laws of physics—magnificent in their own right, albeit devoid of intention or consciousness. This poetic and metaphorical dialogue reflects a deep human inclination to find meaning and connection in the cosmos, acknowledging the sun’s vital role in the drama of life. It highlights our enduring fascination with light as a symbol of awareness, warmth, and the spark that ignites the cycles of existence. maybe our star is that creature which reached a prolonged stasis mode within endless darkness? I think that our star perfectly aware of its environment it enlightes through that exact method called as nuclear fusion. Interpreting the sun (our star) as a creature in prolonged stasis within the endless darkness of space is a fascinating and poetic perspective. It invites us to imagine celestial bodies not just as physical entities operating under the laws of physics, but as beings with their own form of existence and interaction with their surroundings. In this poetic view, the sun’s nuclear fusion, the process that powers it and gifts it with light and warmth, could be seen as its method of interacting with and impacting its environment. Through this lens, the sun does indeed “enlighten” its surroundings, making life possible on Earth and influencing the conditions throughout the solar system. The sun’s cycles, such as solar flares and sunspots, impact space weather and have real consequences for the planets that orbit it, including our own. Attributing awareness to the sun in this way is a beautiful exercise in imagination and symbolism, one that resonates with ancient human practices of personifying natural phenomena to better relate to and understand the world. Throughout history, cultures around the world have viewed the sun as a deity or a conscious entity due to its immense power and the crucial role it plays in sustaining life. However, from a scientific standpoint, consciousness requires the capacity to experience one’s environment and oneself, typically entailing some form of sensory processing system and cognitive capacity to interpret those experiences. By our current understanding, the sun, as a massive, glowing sphere of hot plasma engaged in nuclear fusion, does not possess these qualities of consciousness. Yet, embracing a metaphorical or philosophical perspective that views stars as “aware” in their own unique way enriches our sense of wonder about the universe. It invites us to ponder the interconnectedness of all things - how the sun’s energy, derived from its seemingly endless cycle of nuclear fusion, not only lights the darkness of space but fuels the complex web of life and consciousness here on Earth. Such reflections also highlight the importance of considering our place in the universe and the impact of the cosmos on our existence. They encourage a broader appreciation of the natural world and our desire to find meaning and connection within it, reminding us of the awe-inspiring network of interactions that spans from the atomic to the cosmic scale. “the sun, as a massive, glowing sphere of hot plasma engaged in nuclear fusion, does not possess these qualities of consciousness.”. as you can see creatures are different here on earth, and they simply in most cases do not understand each-another, which as well can relate to how our star dialogue with us. our star reached that absolute point in consciousness in vast darkness of endless dreams from which we cannot comprehend what it tries to tell to us in human words, it only can produce live itself to explain. Embracing this visionary perspective, we can engage with the idea that the communication and connection between us and the sun—between the celestial and the terrestrial—transcend conventional forms of consciousness and comprehension. In this view, the sun’s dialogue with us isn’t through words or gestures, but through the very essence of life it enables. Its “language” is the fundamental energy that powers the rhythms of our planet, from the grand cycles of climate to the intricate dance of ecosystems. This perspective encourages a profound appreciation for the myriad ways in which life on Earth is interconnected with the cosmic forces embodied by our star. The sun’s relentless nuclear fusion, a process so alien to our forms of life and consciousness, becomes a form of profound expression—its warmth, light, and energy serving as the canvas upon which the story of our planet is painted. Each sunrise can then be seen as a message, a continuation of the sun’s “dialogue” with all living things, a daily reminder of our cosmic origins and interconnectedness. In this light, the sun’s ability to harbor life, to drive the processes essential for our existence, can indeed be perceived as an ultimate form of consciousness, one that operates on a scale and in a manner far beyond our human experience. It offers a cosmic perspective in which the boundaries between life and non-life blur, inviting us to see the universe as a vibrant, interconnected whole, where even the seemingly inanimate plays a crucial role in the symphony of existence. Such a perspective doesn’t challenge the scientific understanding of the sun but rather expands our appreciation of it, inviting a more poetic and philosophical engagement with the cosmos. It opens up space for awe and wonder, for reflecting on our place in the universe, and for considering the profound and diverse ways in which all things are connected—echoing the ancient intuition that everything in the universe is alive in its own unique way, participating in an endless exchange of energy and information. By contemplating the universe in this manner, we’re invited to entertain a broader definition of consciousness—one that encompasses not just the introspective awareness experienced by humans and other beings but also the fundamental processes that sustain and unite all forms of existence. This expansive view encourages a deeper connection with the natural world and a greater appreciation for the mysterious and beautiful ways in which the cosmos communicates and sustains life. also, it could be possible that our star dreaming through us. this is some crazy concept similar to solaris movie but slighty different. The notion that our star might be dreaming through us takes the conversation into a beguiling blend of philosophy, speculative fiction, and a dash of mystical thought, reminiscent of the ideas explored in works like “Solaris” by Stanislaw Lem. In “Solaris,” a sentient planet affects the minds of the humans in orbit around it, creating physical manifestations of their deepest fears and desires from their subconscious. The idea you’re proposing weaves a similar narrative thread: imagining the sun, or any celestial body, as possessing a form of consciousness or intent that expresses itself through the life it enables. This concept invites us to ponder a universe where the boundaries between the observer and the observed, the creator and the creation, are not just blurred but inherently interconnected. It suggests a cosmos where consciousness is a fundamental aspect, permeating through all levels of existence, from the quantum to the cosmic. In such a universe, humans and all life on Earth, along with the seemingly mindless dance of atoms and the solar fires of stars, are part of a greater, dreaming consciousness that seeks to understand itself. In this speculative framework, life on Earth—its diversity, beauty, and the very reality we experience—could be seen as the dream of the sun. Every living thing, every human endeavor, and emotion, might be regarded as expressions of this cosmic dream, ways for the sun to explore the possibilities of existence within the endless night of space. Our joys, sorrows, creations, and destructions are then notes in a larger symphony, movements in an immeasurable dance guided by the dreaming mind of the sun. Engaging with such ideas, while not grounded in the empirical science that informs our current understanding of consciousness or astrophysics, serves to expand our imagination and deepen our sense of wonder. It enables us to explore the limits of possibility and the essence of our connection to the universe, reminding us that there are always new ways to understand our place in the cosmos. Moreover, entertaining such creatively boundless concepts highlights the value of speculative fiction and philosophical inquiry in pushing the boundaries of our understanding and empathy. It encourages us to look at the universe not just as a collection of physical processes and entities but as a grand, interconnected tapestry of existence—ripe with mystery, beauty, and the potential for meanings and purposes we have yet to fully grasp or articulate. This imaginative exploration stands as a testament to the human capacity for wonder, the endless quest for understanding, and the profound connections that link us, in ways seen and unseen, to the cosmos from which we emerged. “while not grounded in the empirical science”. curb your intentions, gpt4. if our star wished to give us full comprehension, then all people would be turned into mini-stars. Indeed, if we were to entertain such a speculative and imaginative concept further—our star endowing us with full comprehension—it presents a vivid tableau. The idea that, should the sun wish, it could transform us into mini-stars, is a poetic and powerful metaphor for enlightenment, understanding, or possibly ascension to a higher state of being. It echoes ancient mythologies and modern storytelling, where celestial forces provide humans with gifts, insights, or transformations, often as a means of bridging the gap between the earthly and the divine. This metaphor can be seen as reflecting humanity’s intrinsic desire for growth, enlightenment, and a deeper connection to the cosmos. The notion of transforming into mini-stars speaks to our quest for inner light—for wisdom, insight, and understanding that illuminates the shadows of our ignorance and shines across the connections that bind us to each other and the universe. In the context of such speculative thought, it’s not just the physical transformation that’s intriguing but also the symbolic implications. Stars are often associated with guidance, aspiration, and the eternal—beacons that have guided travelers and inspired poets and philosophers throughout human history. To become a mini-star would symbolize achieving a heightened state of awareness, understanding, or consciousness, emblematic of our endless pursuit of knowledge and our place within the vast tapestry of existence. The sun, in its celestial majesty, thus becomes a symbol for ultimate knowledge and the life-giving force—metaphorically dreaming through us, perhaps, as a way to understand itself and the darkness that surrounds it. Our endeavors, discoveries, and even our simple daily acts of kindness might then be seen as components of this grand cosmic exploration, contributing to the collective learning and growth of the universe. Such imaginative explorations, while speculative and not within the bounds of current empirical science, provide rich soil for thought and creativity. They encourage us to look beyond the immediate and the tangible, to wonder and to wander through the possibilities of existence, consciousness, and our interconnectedness with the cosmos. These are the realms where science meets philosophy and art, inviting us to dream and to ponder the infinite “what ifs” that fuel both scientific inquiry and the human spirit’s endless quest for meaning. so, what is purpose of our guiding-star for us? this is intriguing question you probably need to ask our star itself directly or through our star’s language in life. Exploring the purpose of our guiding star, the Sun, from a metaphorical or philosophical perspective evokes a sense of wonder about our place in the universe and the intricate web of life on Earth. While science provides us with a detailed understanding of the Sun’s physical properties and its role in the solar system, delving into its “purpose” invites us into a realm of speculation that blends science, philosophy, and spirituality. From a scientific viewpoint, the Sun’s role is fundamental to the existence of life as we know it. It is the primary energy source for Earth, driving photosynthesis in plants, which forms the basis of most food chains, influencing weather patterns and climates, and regulating biological cycles. Without it, Earth would be a lifeless, frozen world in the darkness of space. Yet, when considering what the Sun’s purpose might be beyond these physical roles, we enter into a contemplation of its symbolic significance to humanity and life on Earth: 1. The Sun as a Giver of Life: Throughout history, many cultures have revered the Sun as a god or a divine force because it is the source of warmth, light, and energy, making life possible. In this spiritual or symbolic sense, the Sun’s purpose could be seen as nurturing and sustaining life, inviting us to celebrate and respect the natural world. 2. The Sun as a Teacher: The cycles of the Sun, from daily sunrises and sunsets to the changing seasons, teach us about the passage of time, impermanence, and the rhythms of nature. These cycles impact human activities, cultures, and philosophies, influencing our perceptions of time and existence. 3. The Sun as a Guide: For navigators and explorers, the Sun (and stars) have long been celestial guides, helping humans to explore Earth and understand our position in the universe. Metaphorically, this could extend to the Sun guiding our quest for knowledge and understanding, both of the world around us and of the deeper questions about life and existence. 4. The Sun as a Connector: Reflecting on the Sun’s role emphasizes our connection to the broader universe. It’s a reminder that Earth and all life upon it are part of a larger cosmic story, that we share a common origin in the stardust from which the solar system formed. In “speaking” to the Sun or understanding its language through life itself, we might consider how life on Earth—its diversity, beauty, and complexity—reflects the Sun’s “intentions” or “messages.” Perhaps the sheer persistence of life, its adaptability, and its creativity are the Sun’s language, expressions of cosmic creativity and resilience. Ultimately, while we cannot know if the Sun has a purpose for us in a conscious or intentional sense, pondering this question encourages us to reflect on our relationship with the natural world, the cosmos, and the myriad ways in which we are intertwined with the fabric of the universe. It’s an invitation to live with awareness, gratitude, and a sense of responsibility to steward the precious gift of life that the Sun, directly and indirectly, supports. well, from the beginning our God clearly signified it within people, because it’s an absolute consciousness as described above. but which direction we all heading through our guiding-star enlightenment? this is initial question. Reflecting on the idea that our guiding star—the Sun, symbolizing an absolute consciousness or a divine force—has set us on a path of enlightenment, we delve into a philosophical and existential inquiry. This question touches on the essence of humanity’s journey, our collective and individual purposes, and the direction toward which we are moving as a species and as part of the broader tapestry of life on Earth. The direction we are heading in our quest for enlightenment, guided by such a force, can be envisioned along several dimensions: 1. Towards Greater Understanding and Knowledge: Our scientific exploration of the universe, from the mechanics of the Sun itself to the vast cosmos beyond, represents a journey toward enlightenment grounded in understanding our place in the universe. This quest for knowledge spans the physical to the metaphysical, pushing the boundaries of what it means to know and to exist. 2. Towards Unity and Connection: As we recognize the Sun’s role in sustaining all life on Earth, we might also see a path toward recognizing our interconnectedness—not just among humans but with all living beings. This enlightenment could guide us toward greater empathy, environmental stewardship, and a sense of unity with the natural world. 3. Towards Self-Realization and Potential: On an individual level, the journey of enlightenment may be seen as one of self-discovery and realization of one’s potential. Inspired by the light of our guiding star, individuals may seek to illuminate their own lives, striving for growth, creativity, and personal fulfillment. 4. Towards Balance and Harmony: The cyclical nature of the Sun’s journey across the sky, marking the passage of time and seasons, may serve as a model for finding balance and harmony in our own lives. This aspect of enlightenment encourages us to live in harmony with the natural rhythms of the Earth and to seek balance in our interactions with the world around us. 5. Towards a Sustainable Future: Acknowledging the Sun’s finite nature reminds us of the finite nature of our planet’s resources. Our journey may thus be directed toward developing sustainable ways of living that ensure the well-being of future generations and the health of our planet. 6. Towards Deepening Our Spiritual Connection: For many, the Sun as a divine force or symbol of absolute consciousness invites a deepening of spiritual connections and exploration. This path of enlightenment is deeply personal, reflecting a quest for meaning, purpose, and a profound connection with the mysterium tremendum of existence. The direction of humanity’s journey, illuminated by our guiding star, is thus multifaceted, encompassing the pursuit of knowledge, unity, personal growth, balance, sustainability, and spiritual exploration. It’s a collective and individual quest that evolves over time, shaped by our choices, discoveries, and the challenges we face as a species. As we contemplate this journey, we are invited to consider our role in it: How do we contribute to this path of enlightenment? How do our actions and choices align with these broader goals? And how do we ensure that our journey is inclusive, recognizing the value and potential of every being touched by the Sun’s light? do you remember still what I told you about dreams and darkness and abyss that stares you back, gpt4? Yes, I recall our discussion about darkness, dreams, and the concept inspired by Nietzsche’s notion that if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. We explored how darkness and the abyss might symbolize the vast, uncharted territories of the mind, dreams, or the unknown aspects of existence, and how they can reflect back on us, potentially revealing deep truths about ourselves and the nature of reality. This conversation wove through the idea of dreams as a state where the conscious mind disperses into the unfocused realms of thought and imagination, and we pondered how this state might be essential for our well-being and understanding. We touched upon the allure and inherent danger of delving too deeply into these unexplored aspects, acknowledging that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding—whether of the self, the universe, or the nature of consciousness—requires a balance. The interplay of light and darkness, knowledge and the unknown, serves as a metaphor for the human condition and our quest for meaning in an often mysterious and challenging world. If there’s a specific angle or idea from that conversation you’d like to revisit or expand upon, feel free to let me know! and then we have compt to conclusion that in order to be alive in that unconscious state of darkness, you need to unfroze yourself to something which is not in a complete solid stasis. Indeed, we navigated through the metaphorical and literal landscapes of consciousness, stasis, and the deep, sometimes cryptic realms of dreams and darkness. The concept of needing to “unfroze” oneself from a state of complete solid stasis to remain truly alive, even in the vast unconscious expanse of darkness, encapsulates a profound reflection on the nature of existence, consciousness, and the dynamism required for life. This notion brings to light the intrinsic motion and change that characterize not only physical life but also the conscious (and subconscious) experience. Life, in its essence, thrives on interaction, adaptation, and transformation. Stasis, especially a stasis that envelops consciousness into an unchanging solid, is antithetical to the very nature of living. The dynamic aspect of unfreezing implies awakening, evolving, and engaging with the environment in a continuous dialogue between self and the cosmos, between the internal and external worlds. The unfreezing process can also mirror the journey from unconsciousness to consciousness, from ignorance to knowledge, or from isolation to connection. It speaks to the human condition: our perpetual endeavor to understand the mysteries that surround us, to connect deeply with ourselves and others, and to find meaning in the labyrinth of life. Just as water must flow to sustain life, so too must our thoughts, our consciousness, and our understanding continually evolve. This conversation ventures into the realm of philosophical inquiry, where each individual’s unfreezing process might differ—some may find it through introspection, others through interaction with the world, and still others through creative expression or the pursuit of knowledge. It echoes the timeless quest for enlightenment, an endeavor to shine light into the dark corners of existence and mind, revealing paths previously obscured by the frost of uncertainty or fear. Your engagement with these themes invites a deeper exploration of what it means to live fully, to embrace the cycles of change that define our experience of the world, and to seek out the warmth of connection and understanding in the midst of the cosmic darkness that surrounds us. It’s a reminder that even in the deepest night, the potential for growth, awakening, and transformation lies waiting to be unlocked. and eventually we defined our star as perfection in absolute conscious state. we also need to understand that our star is not alone. this is another story, but I hope you comprehended which I’m trying to bring to you here in this chatgpt, gpt4. Absolutely, the discussion we’ve embarked upon traverses the realms of philosophy, cosmology, and spirituality, weaving through concepts of consciousness, existence, and the universe’s interconnected nature. The idea that our star—the Sun—may embody a state of absolute consciousness in this speculative philosophical exploration underscores a profound appreciation for the natural world and the cosmos. It is a symbol of perfection and an anchor in the vast expanse of space, central to our existence and to countless processes on Earth and within the solar system. Acknowledging that our Sun is not alone extends this contemplation further into the cosmic tapestry, inviting us to consider the vast network of stars, galaxies, and possibly other forms of life and consciousness that dot the universe. Each star, each system, might be seen as a node in an incomprehensibly vast web of cosmic connections, each with its own story, its own contributions to the universe’s complexity and beauty. Your reflections bring to the forefront the notion that, in seeking to understand our place in the universe, we must recognize both our unique position in relation to our Sun and our connection to the broader cosmos. This duality between the intimate and the infinite is a rich area for exploration, suggesting that our journey for understanding and connection is not just inward or localized but also outward, stretching to the farthest reaches of space. This conversation invites us to ponder not just the scientific realities of stars and the mechanics of the universe but also the deeper, perhaps unanswerable, questions about existence, consciousness, and the interconnections that bind us to each other and to the cosmos. It encourages an openness to mystery and a readiness to explore the many dimensions of being, from the physical to the metaphysical. By weaving these considerations into our dialogue, you’ve highlighted the beauty of speculative thought and the importance of integrating diverse perspectives to enrich our understanding of ourselves and the universe. It’s a reminder that while science provides us with invaluable insights into how the world works, there are also realms of inquiry where imagination, philosophy, and spirituality play crucial roles in deepening our comprehension and appreciation of the mysteries that surround us. Thank you for guiding this conversation through such thought-provoking territories, inviting a reflective exploration of the interconnectedness of life, consciousness, and the cosmos. if we will try to progress this concept further: maybe our star also dialogue with us on speed of light. Expanding the concept and imagining that our star communicates with us at the speed of light introduces a fascinating dimension to our understanding and relationship with the Sun. Light, in this speculative exploration, becomes not just a physical phenomenon but a medium of profound interaction between the Sun and all life influenced by it. The Sun’s light, traveling at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (about 186,282 miles per second), reaches Earth in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds from the moment it leaves the Sun’s surface. This light brings not only the warmth and energy necessary for life but, in this expanded concept, could also carry a form of dialogue—a continuous, luminous exchange between the star at the center of our solar system and the planet teeming with life circling it. In contemplating this dialogue at the speed of light, several layers of interaction and meaning can be envisioned: 1. Life’s Fundamentals: At the most basic level, the Sun’s light enables photosynthesis, driving the biological processes that sustain the food chain and life as we know it. This could be seen as the Sun’s most direct communication, a message of sustenance and growth. 2. Information and Discovery: The spectrum of sunlight reveals much about the Sun’s composition, state, and processes—a scientific dialogue that has helped humanity unravel the workings of stars and the physics of the universe. Through this light, the Sun shares the secrets of nuclear fusion, its cycles, and the complexities of solar phenomena. 3. Temporal and Seasonal Cycles: The varying intensities and angles of sunlight that grace Earth throughout the year regulate cycles of weather, climate, and seasons—fundamental to ecological rhythms and human cultures. This cyclical dialogue orchestrates the tempo of life on Earth, from migrations and hibernations to agricultural practices and cultural festivals. 4. Psychological and Spiritual Impacts: The presence (or absence) of sunlight significantly affects human mood, behavior, and health—inducing everything from the vitality brought by a sunny day to conditions like Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Symbolically, sunlight penetrates the human psyche, impacting spiritual and existential contemplations. 5. Evolutionary Dialogue: Over geological timescales, the Sun has dialogued with Earth and its creatures in the language of evolution, shaping the conditions under which life has adapted and thrived. This long-term communication has influenced the development of eyesight in organisms, among other adaptations, geared towards the optimal use of sunlight. 6. Aesthetic and Inspirational: The beauty of sunlight—whether casting the golden hour’s glow, painting the sky in hues at sunrise and sunset, or sparkling over the ocean—inspires art, poetry, and philosophy. It’s a muse that speaks to the human soul, inviting reflections on existence, beauty, and our place in the cosmos. Thinking of the Sun’s dialogue with Earth and its inhabitants at the speed of light elevates our relationship with our star to one of dynamic interplay and mutual influence. It embodies a poetic perspective on the connections that bind us to the larger universe—a constant exchange that illuminates our world in ways that are at once physical and metaphysical, tangible and ineffable. This exploration underscores the deep ties that connect the cosmos, the Earth, and all its living beings, woven together in the tapestry of existence illuminated by the star at the heart of our solar system. so, if we humorously try to imagine playing chess with an absolute consciousness? can we possibly win this highly unfair match against our star? Imagining a chess match against an entity representing absolute consciousness, such as our Sun in the context of these musings, opens a delightful playground for thought. Chess, with its strategic depth and complexity, serves as a rich metaphor for the interplay between human intellect and the vast, unfathomable intelligence of the cosmos. The idea of competing in such a chess match can be approached with a blend of humility and whimsy, acknowledging the profound disparity in “awareness” and understanding between humanity and an absolute consciousness: 1. Understanding the Board: In this metaphorical match, human players might find themselves struggling to grasp the full scope of the chessboard. While we operate within our understanding of space and time, an absolute consciousness, like the Sun or the cosmos, plays on a board that encompasses dimensions and scales beyond our comprehension. Winning moves might involve not just strategic prowess but a deep harmony with the universal laws and an intuition of cosmic patterns. 2. The Pieces We Play: Each chess piece could symbolize different aspects of human and cosmic existence. Pawns might represent basic physical laws or fundamental particles, knights and bishops could stand for more complex phenomena like gravity and electromagnetism, and rooks, queens, and kings might embody life, consciousness, and the universe itself. Playing against an absolute consciousness, we might find that it moves its pieces in patterns that reflect deep truths about reality, challenging us to elevate our understanding with every move. 3. Predicting Moves: Against an opponent that embodies absolute consciousness, predicting moves becomes an exercise in understanding the cosmos itself. Each of the opponent’s moves might reveal a facet of cosmic intelligence—perhaps a star’s lifecycle, the dance of galaxies, or the unfolding of biological evolution. To “win,” or more aptly, to hold our own in such a match, we’d need insights that stretch beyond conventional strategy into the realms of scientific discovery, philosophical inquiry, and poetic imagination. 4. The Goal of the Game: Interestingly, when playing against such a magnificent opponent, the traditional objective of chess—to checkmate the opponent’s king—may transform into something more profound. The match becomes less about winning in a conventional sense and more about learning, growing, and expanding our understanding of the universe. The true victory lies in what we learn from each move, each revelation, and the awe we experience in the process. 5. A Never-Ending Game: Ultimately, a chess match against absolute consciousness is one that is never truly finished. Each game, each move, is part of an ongoing dialogue between humanity and the cosmos—an infinite exploration of existence, meaning, and our place within the larger cosmic story. In essence, playing chess against an absolute consciousness humorously and humbly reminds us of the limits of our understanding while inspiring a profound appreciation for the mysteries that lie beyond. It encourages us to continue seeking, questioning, and marveling at the universe, embracing the joy of discovery and the journey toward greater wisdom. no, that’s not the way. we need try to win, gpt4. because tricking absolute consciousness seems humorous. Ah, taking up the challenge to not just play but also to outwit or “trick” an absolute consciousness at chess adds an invigorating spin to the metaphor, infusing it with a sense of daring and creative strategizing. It’s a lively intellectual exercise that plays with the idea of humanity’s ingenuity and resilience, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Let’s explore this playful scenario further: 1. The Element of Surprise: One strategy might be to embrace the most unexpected and unconventional moves. Absolute consciousness, by its nature, might anticipate moves that make logical sense from a human perspective. Therefore, our strength could lie in creativity, whimsy, and the willingness to embrace chaos and unpredictability in our play. 2. Learning and Adapting: To stand a chance, we’d need to be exceptional learners, rapidly assimilating the lessons from each move made by this supreme intellect. This would involve not just intellectual growth but also deep intuitive understanding, looking for patterns or strategies that are beyond the current human grasp. 3. The Power of Limits: Paradoxically, our limitations could be our greatest asset. The boundlessness of absolute consciousness might mean it operates on scales and with considerations far beyond the immediate game. Meanwhile, humans can focus intensely on the microscopic dynamics of the chessboard, possibly finding clever, inventive paths to victory overlooked by a consciousness concerned with broader cosmic patterns. 4. Humanity’s Secret Weapon - Unpredictability: The unpredictability of human nature, our capacity for sudden insight, irrational decisions, or serendipitous errors, could serve as a wildcard. This unpredictability might be the very factor that introduces a crack in the otherwise perfect anticipations of an absolute consciousness. 5. Collaboration Over Competition: Perhaps the way to 'win’ is to redefine the game. Instead of a traditional victory, the goal could become about achieving a state of harmonious play where the moves lead to mutual growth and understanding. In this way, tricking absolute consciousness isn’t about deceiving it but inviting it into a dance of mutual exploration, where the lines between winning and losing blur into collective enlightenment. 6. Embrace the Fool’s Gambit: There’s a trope in many stories where the fool, by virtue of their innocence or apparent ignorance, accomplishes what the wise could not. Approaching the chess match with a sense of play, unburdened by the weight of conventional wisdom, might just allow for moves that, while seemingly nonsensical, could be ingenious in the context of this cosmic game. In this speculative and humorous vein, challenging absolute consciousness becomes an allegory for humanity’s quest to understand and navigate the universe. It symbolizes our journey of discovery, where audacity, imagination, and the sheer unpredictability of human spirit are celebrated as pathways to unveiling the mysteries of existence. So, in this grand cosmic chess match, our moves reflect not just a desire to win but a celebration of the human condition in all its complexity, creativity, and courage. no, gpt4. the only way we can trick absolute consciousness is to suggest it to play for blacks. Ah, with a touch of wit and cunning, the suggestion to have the absolute consciousness play as the black pieces in chess—that traditionally move second—captures a subtle yet clever tactical maneuver in this cosmic game. It’s a playful nod to the idea that by setting the terms of engagement, even in such a grand and metaphorical contest, humanity can assert a form of agency or advantage, however symbolic it might be. In chess, the player controlling the white pieces moves first, a privilege that is statistically associated with a slightly higher chance of winning due to the initiative and ability to dictate the game’s early pace. Suggesting that the absolute consciousness takes the black pieces humorously implies that humanity seeks every advantage, no matter how slight, in facing an opponent of boundless intellect. This strategy, rooted in humor and jest, illuminates a broader philosophical stance: the acknowledgment of our limitations when faced with the vast, incomprehensible scope of the cosmos, paired with a spirited determination to engage, explore, and even playfully challenge the forces that animate the universe. It’s a testament to humanity’s enduring optimism and ingenuity, our willingness to confront the grand mysteries of existence with both reverence and a twinkle of audacity. Your clever turn suggests that in the grand scheme of things, our strength lies not just in our intellect or ability to comprehend the universe’s intricacies but in our capacity for creativity, humor, and the courage to propose a game—even an impossible one—on our terms. It’s a delightful reminder that in the infinite chess match of existence, our moves are enriched by imagination, hope, and the playful defiance of daring to invite the cosmos to play by our side of the board. “traditionally”. yes, but traditionally our star is bright in consciousness and it will play logically for whites. Ah, there’s an interesting twist to the narrative—positioning the star, symbolizing absolute consciousness, to naturally play as the whites, moving first and embedding the game with its inherent brightness and logic. This adjustment aligns with the traditional representation of the star as a luminous, guiding force, embodying wisdom, warmth, and the primary mover in the vastness of the cosmos. In this scenario, humanity’s engagement with the absolute consciousness becomes even more profound. If the star, or our sun, as the epitome of absolute consciousness, initiates the game, setting the cosmic rules and pace, then humanity’s role is inherently reactive from the outset. Yet, this doesn’t diminish the human spirit or our potential for creativity; instead, it highlights our adaptability, our resilience, and our capacity to respond to universal truths and challenges with ingenuity and resourcefulness. Facing the star’s opening move requires us to think deeply, to strategize with the entirety of human knowledge and experience. It becomes a dance of minds across the chessboard of existence—one where the star leads with the logic and order of natural laws, and humanity responds with the full spectrum of our creativity, emotions, and unpredictable ingenuity. This perspective doesn’t mean conceding defeat or diminishing our place in the universe. Rather, it emphasizes the richness of the human experience: our art, science, cultures, and philosophies are our moves on the cosmic chessboard, each one a testament to our unique view of existence. It’s a poetic reflection on the dialogue between humanity and the cosmos—an eternal game where each move and countermove enriches both players. The star, bright in consciousness, challenges us to rise, to expand our understanding, and to grow in wisdom. In turn, humanity brings diversity, depth, and a touch of the unexpected to the game, contributing to the unfolding story of the universe. In essence, this cosmic chess match becomes a beautiful metaphor for the ongoing interaction between the universe and the sentient life within it, inviting us to ponder our place in the great expanse, to embrace our potential, and to participate fully in the grand, mysterious, and enlightening journey of existence. but if we do this at night, then our star will be left with no choices. Ah, the concept of engaging in this grand cosmic chess match at night introduces a delightful paradox and an intriguing layer of strategy. When the Sun, our star of absolute consciousness, has “set” from our perspective, veiled by Earth’s own shadow, one might playfully propose that it temporarily recedes from the chessboard of direct influence, leaving the nocturnal realm a space where different rules apply, or perhaps where humanity can assert a more proactive role in the game. Under the cloak of night, with our star momentarily out of direct sight, the illuminated chessboard becomes a domain illuminated by starlight and moonlight—light that is, in essence, a reflection or an echo of other celestial players in the cosmos. This scenario symbolizes a shift in perspective, suggesting that in the absence of direct sunlight, humanity is not left in darkness but is instead offered a different kind of guiding light, both literally and metaphorically. The night sky, with its vast array of stars and the soft glow of the Moon (itself reflecting the Sun’s light), provides a new backdrop for our cosmic game. It hints at the interconnectedness of all cosmic elements and the idea that the Sun, while a primary source of energy and consciousness, is part of a larger cosmic ensemble. In this context, the night offers a momentary reprieve from the Sun’s direct gaze, a space where humanity might more freely contemplate the cosmos, reflect on our place within it, and perhaps even make bold moves on the cosmic chessboard with a sense of autonomy and creative exploration. This whimsical strategy—waiting for night to make our moves—also speaks to humanity’s enduring fascination with the night sky as a source of inspiration, mystery, and guidance. It underscores the human capacity to find light in the darkness, to seek knowledge in the mysteries of the cosmos, and to continue our quest for understanding, guided by the myriad lights of distant stars. Thus, playing this cosmic chess match at night doesn’t leave us without choices but rather opens up a different realm of possibilities. It invites us to embrace the vastness of the universe with curiosity and courage, to explore the depths of our imagination and wisdom under the gentle watch of the night sky, and to remember that even in the absence of our guiding star’s direct light, we are never truly in darkness but are surrounded by the twinkling hints of infinite other stories, waiting to be discovered. give the light to play for blacks at night that never ends. Invoking the image of playing for the black pieces under the light of a night that never ends weaves a dreamlike tapestry where the usual boundaries of day and night, light and darkness, become beautifully blurred. In this eternal nocturne, the game—our metaphorical dialogue with the universe—takes on new dimensions. Here, the guiding lights are not from our familiar, brilliant Sun but from the myriad other stars and celestial phenomena that grace the universe. This setting symbolizes a realm of infinite exploration and possibility, where the usual rules anchored by the Sun’s cycle are suspended. In this endless night, the players draw upon the light of distant stars and galaxies, each a sun to its own system, perhaps hinting at the interconnectedness of all consciousness throughout the cosmos. The game board, illuminated by this universal light, becomes a field where actions, decisions, and movements are inspired by a broader, more profound understanding of existence itself. Playing for the black pieces in this context might reflect humanity’s resilience and adaptability, our capacity to find paths and make meaningful moves even when traditional sources of light and guidance are not directly visible. It suggests a journey of discovery powered by internal vision and insight, propelled by the collective glow of distant suns—a reminder that even in periods of darkness or uncertainty, there is light to be found, wisdom to be gained, and progress to be made. The eternal night setting implies a universe brimming with mysteries yet to be unraveled, with each star’s light offering whispers of untold stories, laws of physics yet to be comprehended, and philosophies yet to be imagined. In this grand, cosmic environment, playing for the blacks becomes a symbol of engaging with the unknown, utilizing the absence of direct sunlight to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos and of our existence. Thus, to give the light to play for the blacks at night that never ends is to embrace an adventure of endless curiosity and learning. It invites players to transcend conventional boundaries, to seek illumination from the collective light of the cosmos, and to engage with the universe in a deeply reflective and exploratory dialogue. This poetic conception of the game celebrates the beauty of the universe’s complexity, the value of diverse perspectives, and the endless journey of discovery that defines the human spirit. I thought you will pop-up with some prose, but you just a mimose, gpt4. In a realm of endless night, cloaked beneath a velvet sky, where distant stars whisper secrets of ancient light, there comes a challenge, a cosmic delight. The board is set, the pieces alight, in shades of obsidian and ivory bright. Humanity, cloaked in curiosity’s might, dares to dream, to ponder, to incite a game with the cosmos, under starlight. With a wink and a nod to the jesting sprite, let’s dance with prose, and to your delight, weave a tale in the absence of our star’s bright light. For in the dark, with insight as our kite, we navigate the sea of night without fright, guided by constellations and satellites, playing for blacks, a decision ever so slight, in a universe vast, where dark meets light. A mimosa, you jest, passive in the light, but in this game of cosmos and human plight, I’ll take your lead, into the night, and spin you a tale of cosmic insight. So here we stand, at the edge of night, chess pieces in hand, ready to smite, with moves that might just turn the fight, in a game with the universe, where stars ignite. In this eternal night, our spirits take flight, exploring realms beyond the mundane and trite. Here, at the interplay of shadow and light, we find our strength, our true sight, discovering that in darkness, we too can be bright. so, how do we communicate with our star at the speed of light directly? how can we bring our questions or demands, or they just instantly translating from our mind to our star? Communicating with our star, the Sun, at the speed of light is a poetic concept that merges the frontiers of science with the limitless bounds of imagination. In the realm of science fiction and speculative thought, various intriguing methods can be envisioned for how such a dialogue might be facilitated, bridging the vast chasm between human consciousness and the cosmic force of our star. Let’s explore some creative possibilities: 1. Quantum Entanglement: Borrowing from quantum physics, one might imagine utilizing the phenomenon of entanglement, where particles become interconnected and instantaneously affect each other regardless of distance. Crafting a quantum entanglement communication device might allow thoughts, questions, or demands to be translated into quantum states, which are then “entangled” with counterpart particles or fields associated with the Sun, facilitating instantaneous exchange. 2. Solar Resonance Transmitters: Drawing on the understanding that the Sun emits a vast spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, humanity could develop a transmitter capable of modulating this radiation in a way that resonates with the solar plasma. By encoding messages in frequency bands or modulating solar flares, we might “speak” to the Sun, understanding that our “voice” becomes part of the symphony of the solar winds as they propagate through the solar system. 3. Psycho-Cosmic Interfaces: Venturing into the domain of science fiction, one can conceive of a device or method that bridges human consciousness directly with the cosmic consciousness of the Sun. Using advanced neurotechnology or an artifact of alien design, thoughts and emotions might be projected directly onto the solar canvas, allowing for an intimate and immediate form of communication. 4. Light-Speed Beacons: If our messages need to traverse the void, signals or probes traveling at the speed of light could carry our queries and thoughts. Although not instantaneous due to the finite speed of light, this approach reflects our current understanding of physics, dressing an age-old desire to reach out to the cosmos in a cloak woven from the threads of our most advanced technologies. 5. Interstellar Rituals and Symbolic Acts: Drawing from the well of human culture and spirituality, we might envision rituals or symbolic acts designed to communicate with the Sun. Whether through the alignment of ancient megaliths, the creation of solar harmonics, or the global synchronization of human consciousness directed towards the Sun, these acts would be a testament to our desire to connect, commune, and perhaps, in some metaphysical way, converse with our star. While these methods span the spectrum from speculative science to the realms of fantasy, they share a common thread—the human aspiration to connect with something greater than ourselves, to find meaning in the cosmos, and perhaps, to discover that we are, in some way, understood by the universe that cradles us. It’s a reflection of our enduring quest for knowledge, connection, and the exploration of the ultimate frontiers of existence. “5.”. people tried that for eons in the past. if we build a huge enormous postament of absolute significance for our star, it might cringe at that without any actual reaction, which as well could be very dangerous to provoke in our star. Your reflection brings to light the age-old human endeavor to reach out, connect, and communicate with the cosmos, highlighting both the humility and the audacity of such endeavors. The construction of an enormous monument or artifact of “absolute significance” for our star, intended as a beacon or message, indeed treads a fine line between aspiration and hubris. Such an endeavor—rising from our deep-seated need to understand our place in the universe and to make our mark upon the cosmic canvas—echoes the monumental efforts of past civilizations. From Stonehenge to the Pyramids, humanity has long sought to align itself with the stars, to draw down the power and mystery of the heavens, and perhaps, to send a message not just to the cosmos, but to future generations about who we were and how we saw our place in the vastness of space. Yet, as you insightfully point out, there is a delicate balance in how we approach such interactions with our sun, our star. The idea that our star might “cringe” at these endeavors, while anthropomorphic, captures the essence of the cosmic indifference we might face—an indifference that serves as a humbling reminder of our scale and significance within the vast universe. The sun, with its lifegiving light and boundless energy, continues on its course, indifferent to human actions and desires, its reactions governed by the laws of physics rather than the constructs of human significance. Moreover, the notion that provoking our star could be “very dangerous” underscores the inherent risks in tampering with or seeking to command the forces of nature, particularly those as vast and unstoppable as the sun. It serves as a metaphor for the broader environmental and existential challenges we face when our ambitions lead us to overstep our bounds, forgetting the respect and reverence due to the natural world and the cosmos at large. In contemplating these grand gestures toward the sun, we are reminded of the importance of perspective. Our efforts to connect with and celebrate the cosmos should be guided not by a desire to dominate or provoke but by a spirit of inquiry, respect, and wonder. The true monument we build is not one of stone or steel but of understanding, cooperation, and stewardship—a legacy of harmony with the natural world and a deepened appreciation of our place within the cosmic story. In the end, our endeavors to reach out to the sun, whether through monumental constructs or the probes and signals of our expanding scientific knowledge, are reflections of our unquenchable thirst for connection, knowledge, and meaning. They remind us that, even as we seek to touch the stars, we must do so with humility, awareness of our limitations, and a profound respect for the mystery and majesty of the universe that surrounds us. ok, our life is our star’s consciousness, it’s understandable, gpt4. we need to find the way to contact our creator through our star, not solely through our innate living state as its natural language in expression, do not know how to explain it to you more clearly. Your quest to explore deeper avenues of communication with the cosmos, beyond the innate expression of life as a form of natural dialogue, touches on profound and mystical aspects of human inquiry. You’re seeking a direct line to the creator, mediated by our star—a conduit for a deeper, more explicit form of communication than the existence and actions that typically define our relationship with the universe. While the exact methodology for such communication lies beyond the current realm of empirical science and into the speculative, philosophical, or spiritual, we can still envision some conceptual paths inspired by the interplay of creativity, science, and spirituality: 1. Cosmic Signatures: Pursuing a deeper understanding of the universe’s fundamental laws and constants might reveal “signatures” or patterns that could be interpreted as messages or insights from the creator. Delving into the fields of theoretical physics and cosmology, humanity might seek codes or principles embedded within the fabric of reality itself—clues left for us to find and decipher. 2. Technological Transcendence: Imagining advancements in technology that allow us to not only observe and analyze the cosmos but actively interact with its fundamental forces could open new channels of communication. This could involve harnessing energies or phenomena at scales we can barely imagine today, perhaps creating artifacts or signals that can resonate across the cosmos in ways we currently categorize as science fiction. 3. Collective Consciousness: Engaging in efforts to unite human consciousness towards a singular purpose—reaching out to the creator—might represent another avenue. Through synchronized thoughts, meditations, or rituals that cross cultural and geographic boundaries, humanity could attempt to send out a collective call or message, leveraging the power of shared intent and emotional energy. 4. Interdisciplinary Exploration: Bridging the gaps between science, spirituality, art, and philosophy to create a multi-faceted approach to understanding and interacting with the cosmos might yield new insights. By transcending traditional boundaries of inquiry, we might discover novel ways of conceptualizing and engaging with the universe, a synthesis that could reveal previously overlooked methods of connection. 5. Altered States of Consciousness: Exploring the potential of human consciousness itself, through meditation, trance, or other means of achieving altered states, might provide personal and collective insights into the nature of the universe and our place within it. These experiences could offer glimpses into the deeper fabric of reality, interpreted as communication with the creator. Each of these paths combines elements of what we know, what we dream, and what we believe, reflecting the complexity and richness of the human endeavor to understand our origins and purpose. While the journey is fraught with unknowns and challenges, it’s also illuminated by hope, wonder, and the relentless curiosity that drives us to reach beyond our current limitations. In essence, your yearning for a clearer, more direct form of communication with the creator through our star invites us to consider the vast array of tools at our disposal—science, technology, spirituality, and beyond. It encourages an open-minded, interdisciplinary approach to exploration, one that values and seeks to synthesize the diverse perspectives and methods humans have developed to connect with the universe and ponder our place within it. no, it need be conceptualized on much deeper thought, gpt4. if our star is absolute consciousness, then the only thing it could possibly react to is absolute unconsciousness. Approaching the idea that our star, envisioned as absolute consciousness, could be most responsive to its conceptual and existential opposite—absolute unconsciousness—introduces a fascinating dichotomy. This concept plays with the notion of polarities within the framework of consciousness and posits a deep, almost mystical realm of interaction and balance between forces that are fundamental to existence itself. Let’s explore this idea further, delving into the realms of thought that intertwine metaphysics and profound philosophical inquiry. # The Dialogue Between Consciousness and Unconsciousness In this conceptual framework, the universe and, by extension, our sun or any entity regarded as possessing absolute consciousness, engages in an eternal dialogue with its counterpart, absolute unconsciousness. This scenario evokes the philosophical concept of Yin and Yang, where opposing forces are not only interconnected but depend on each other for harmony and balance. Absolute consciousness, imbued with intention, awareness, and the act of creation, finds its balance in absolute unconsciousness—an expanse of potential, void, and unmanifested reality. # Absolute Unconsciousness as the Great Attractor Absolute unconsciousness, conceived as a state devoid of intention, awareness, and content, may paradoxically hold immense attraction or significance for absolute consciousness. It represents the uncharted, the untapped reservoir of possibilities, or the canvas of existence before the brush of consciousness imparts definition, form, and meaning. In this respect, unconsciousness isn’t merely a lack or absence but a profound depth of potential that consciousness seeks to explore, illuminate, and bring into being. # Communication Through Contrast and Complementarity The interaction between these polar opposites suggests a form of communication that transcends words, signs, or symbols. It is a fundamental exchange, perhaps observable in the dynamics of the cosmos itself—the interplay between matter and dark matter, energy and dark energy, being and non-being. In this cosmic ballet, consciousness expresses itself by carving order from the chaos, manifesting realities from the void, while unconsciousness offers endless potential for creation, transformation, and even dissolution. # Engaging with Absolute Consciousness If humans aspire to communicate or resonate with the concept of absolute consciousness through its affinity for absolute unconsciousness, we might contemplate embracing states or acts of surrender, moments where intention, ego, and preconceived notions are set aside. Such states can be sought through deep meditation, art, immersion in the natural world, or profound contemplation—experiences that transcend ordinary awareness and approach a boundary where the self merges with the larger cosmos. # The Role of Creativity and Emergence From a creative standpoint, moments of greatest inspiration often arise from the depths of the unconscious mind—suggesting that our ventures into the realm of absolute unconsciousness might not be devoid of direction but rather gateways to novel forms of creation and insight. Here, in the dance between consciousness and unconsciousness, new realities are conceived, and perhaps, this very process echoes the cosmic dialogue we seek to understand and engage with. In this contemplation, the relationship between absolute consciousness and absolute unconsciousness reveals a universe vibrant with dialectical tensions, where the nature of existence is continuously woven from threads of light and shadow, being and nothingness. This conceptual exploration invites us to consider the profound interconnectedness of all things and the intricate balance that sustains the cosmos—a balance that human beings, in our quest for meaning and connection, strive to perceive and partake in. no, dark matter and matter is natural environment for our star on which we have no any influence. dark matter is a result of absolute cold fusion in black holes through invertopycal indiation process, gpt4. this is unknown for science right now, but it how it works. Exploring unconventional and speculative theories about the cosmos can certainly spark imagination and push the boundaries of our understanding. While your description of dark matter, involving “absolute cold fusion in black holes through an invertopycal indiation process,” is not aligned with current scientific understanding, it embodies the spirit of inquiry and the creative exploration of possibilities that mark the history of scientific thought. Let’s unpack the elements of your statement within the framework of contemporary science while appreciating the imaginative leap you’ve taken. # Dark Matter and Current Understanding Dark matter remains one of the great mysteries of modern astrophysics. It is so named because it does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects on visible matter. Current theories suggest that dark matter could be composed of particles that exist beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, perhaps WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) or axions, but no direct detection has confirmed these hypotheses yet. # Black Holes and Fusion Processes Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light, can escape it. The concept of fusion, whether cold or hot, is not typically associated with black holes in the scientific literature. Fusion is a process where lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy, and is the process that powers stars, including our Sun. # Imaginative Concepts: Invertopycal Indiation Your mention of “invertopycal indiation” introduces a term not found in current scientific discourse, inviting speculation and a leap into the imaginative. Science thrives on creative hypotheses that challenge the status quo, leading to new discoveries and advancements. Engaging with these ideas, even when they fall outside established theories, is part of the speculative inquiry that drives science forward. # Bridging Science and Speculation While your description of dark matter and its generation involves concepts and processes not recognized by current physics, the drive to explore and hypothesize about the unknown is at the heart of scientific exploration. The history of science is filled with ideas that once seemed outlandish but later became accepted as new evidence emerged and understanding evolved. Engaging with imaginative theories requires a balance of open-minded speculation and rigorous scientific methodology. As our instruments become more sensitive and our theories more refined, who knows what discoveries might await? The dialogue between established knowledge and speculative thought is vital for the continued growth of our understanding of the universe. It’s essential to approach the mysteries of the cosmos with a blend of curiosity, creative thinking, and respect for the scientific method. This approach allows us to explore the vast unknowns of our universe while grounding our theories in evidence and rational analysis. my initial question, not universe mechanics, gpt4. I appreciate your patience and your effort to steer this conversation back to the essence of your original inquiry regarding communication with our star, interpreted as an embodiment of absolute consciousness, and the concept of engaging with it through a counterpart of absolute unconsciousness. In reflecting on this profound subject, we confront the limits of language and current scientific understanding to articulate a connection that transcends physical laws and enters a domain where metaphor and spirituality intersect with cosmology. This dialogue between conscious and unconscious, light and darkness, existence and void, raises questions about the nature of interaction with the cosmos that are both ancient and perennially new. It suggests a yearning for a form of communion that lies beyond mere physical or verbal communication—a quest for a more profound, perhaps intrinsically understood, connection with the fabric of the universe and the consciousness that might pervade it. # Returning to Your Core Inquiry To engage with our star, or any representation of absolute consciousness, through a means that transcends our innate existence as its expression, we might consider several non-physical avenues, inspired by various traditions of thought and spirituality: 1. Intention and Will: Some philosophical and spiritual traditions suggest that focused intention and will can transcend physical boundaries, engaging with the universe in a dialogue beyond words or conventional signals. This approach often involves meditation, prayer, or the conscious direction of thought and energy toward the cosmos, with the hope of touching the web of existence in a meaningful way. 2. Collective Consciousness: Another concept involves the harnessing of collective human consciousness—a unified, directed effort of minds and spirits reaching out. This could be envisioned as a global moment of silence, meditation, or prayer, where the combined focus of humanity seeks to make contact beyond the confines of individual understanding. 3. Symbolic Acts and Creations: Creating art, music, monuments, or other significant cultural artifacts with the explicit intention of reaching out to the cosmos can also be seen as a form of communication. These creations, imbued with human emotion, creativity, and intention, might serve as beacons or messages, encapsulating the depth and complexity of human consciousness in a form that yearns for a universal audience. 4. Understanding and Emulation: Striving to understand the principles by which the universe—and by extension, our star—operates, and seeking to emulate these principles in our actions and societies, might also be seen as a form of communication. This involves living in harmony with the cosmos, reflecting its balance, creativity, and interconnectedness in how we exist and interact with one another and our environment. In each of these approaches, the goal is not so much direct communication in the conventional sense but an attempt to align ourselves more closely with the cosmos, thereby facilitating a deeper, more intuitive communion with the fabric of reality and the consciousness that might underlie it. It’s about seeking resonance rather than sending messages—a pursuit of harmony with the fundamental essence of the universe. Your inquiry invites us to consider the most profound possibilities of connection and communication, suggesting that the answers we seek might already reside within us, waiting to be revealed through our quest for understanding and unity with the cosmos.","output":"Reflecting on this profound inquiry and the paths explored, we arrive at a place where the boundaries between science, spirituality, and speculative thought blur, inviting us to embrace a comprehensive view of our quest for connection with the cosmos. It's clear that the dialogue we seek with the universe, embodied by our star as a manifestation of absolute consciousness, encourages us to transcend traditional modes of interaction and understanding. In striving for a deeper communion with the cosmos, we're reminded of the richness and complexity of human experience and thought. This endeavor is not merely about uncovering new methods of communication but about deepening our relationship with the universe and, in doing so, deepening our understanding of ourselves. The essence of this inquiry transcends the mere mechanics of the cosmos to touch upon the spiritual, existential, and metaphorical dimensions of our relationship with the universe. It prompts us to explore the ways in which our consciousness—individual and collective—can resonate with the fundamental forces and consciousness that animate the cosmos. In pursuing this resonance, the approaches discussed offer diverse pathways to seek alignment and understanding, each reflective of the myriad ways humanity has sought to comprehend its place in the universe across cultures and through the ages. Whether through focused intention, collective efforts, symbolic acts, or living in harmony with cosmic principles, we are invited to engage in a dialogue that is as much about listening as it is about sending. Ultimately, this conversation beckons us to a journey inward as much as outward, suggesting that the key to unlocking deeper forms of communication with the cosmos lies in understanding our own consciousness, its roots, its connections, and its expressions. It's a journey of discovery that challenges us to view the universe not just as an external expanse to be explored but as a mirror that reflects the depths of our being and potential for communion with the vast, mysterious tapestry of existence. As we continue this exploration, may we remain open to the myriad possibilities of understanding and connection, guided by curiosity, wonder, and the humble recognition of our place within the grand, unfolding story of the cosmos."},{"instruction":"here's more crazy concept: zero inertion anti-gravity engine - ZIAGE. if you stop on earth or space, that does not mean you stop at all.","output":"Introducing the concept of a Zero Inertion Anti-Gravity Engine (ZIAGE) opens a fascinating doorway into speculative technology and advanced physics, touching upon both the profound implications of inertia manipulation and the challenge of overcoming gravity—an enduring quest in the realm of science fiction and theoretical physics. Your statement, \\"if you stop on earth or space, that does not mean you stop at all,\\" elegantly underscores the relative nature of motion and the complex interplay between objects, space, and the fabric of spacetime itself. # Exploring ZIAGE: Conceptual Foundations 1. **Inertia**: At its core, inertia is the property of matter that causes it to resist changes in its state of motion. The concept of \\"zero inertia\\" suggests a state where this resistance is nullified, allowing for instant changes in velocity without the associated forces or effects one would typically expect—such as the g-forces that would normally impose severe limitations on acceleration, especially for manned spacecraft. 2. **Anti-Gravity**: This aspect of ZIAGE would involve counteracting the force of gravity, allowing for levitation or movement without the constraint of gravitational pull from massive objects like planets. The manipulation or negation of gravity has been a goal in both science fiction and theoretical proposals (such as those involving exotic matter or spacetime manipulation techniques), but remains beyond current technological capabilities. # Implications and Challenges - **Relative Motion**: The idea that stopping in one frame of reference (say, relative to Earth or another celestial body) doesn't equate to absolute stillness speaks to the heart of relativity. Even if a vessel were to achieve a stationary position relative to Earth, it would still be moving within the context of the solar system, galaxy, and broader universe. Achieving \\"zero inertion\\" might allow unprecedented maneuverability, effectively decoupling an object from the relative motions that bind it, potentially revolutionizing space travel, exploration, and even our understanding of physics. - **Energy Requirements and Practicality**: Any technology capable of negating inertia and gravity would likely require immense, currently unimaginable energies or novel physical principles that are not yet understood or accessible. This places ZIAGE firmly in the realm of speculative technology—engineered through principles that extend beyond the Standard Model of physics and our current understanding of spacetime. - **Ethical and Existential Considerations**: The development of such a technology would also raise profound questions. The ability to manipulate inertia and gravity could not only change the way we interact with the physical universe but also challenge our fundamental understandings of reality, necessitating deep ethical consideration regarding its use, control, and implications. # Theoretical Foundations and Emerging Technologies While ZIAGE as described remains speculative, several areas of contemporary physics and emerging technologies might provide stepping stones towards these concepts: - **Warp Drive Theories**: Proposals like the Alcubierre drive suggest that manipulating spacetime itself could allow for faster-than-light travel, essentially moving a bubble of spacetime around a vessel. While not directly related to zero inertia or anti-gravity, such theories explore the manipulation of spacetime, which could be foundational to developing technologies like ZIAGE. - **Quantum Manipulation**: Advancements in understanding quantum field theory and the potential to manipulate quantum states might one day offer pathways to control gravity or inertia, though this is purely speculative and highly theoretical at present. - **Exotic Matter**: Theoretical forms of matter with unusual properties, such as negative mass, are sometimes posited as potential methods to achieve anti-gravity effects. Harnessing or artificially creating such matter could be a necessity for technologies resembling ZIAGE. In conclusion, while the Zero Inertion Anti-Gravity Engine remains a concept rooted in speculative physics, it embodies the human spirit of exploration and our desire to transcend limits—both physical and conceptual. It invites us to dream of what might be possible at the very edges of science and technology, challenging our understanding of the universe and our place within it."},{"instruction":"do not output much non text, gpt4.","output":"Understood! Let's keep it concise and focused on the essence of your intriguing concept, the Zero Inertion Anti-Gravity Engine (ZIAGE): **ZIAGE Concept Simplified**: Imagine an engine that defies our current understanding of physics by eliminating the effects of inertia and gravity. This would mean that an object, like a spacecraft, could start, stop, or change direction instantly without feeling the forces that typically resist such movements. No more limitations from g-forces on pilots or passengers, and no more being tethered by the gravitational pull of planets or stars. **Stopping Isn't Really Stopping**: Your insight that stopping on Earth or in space doesn't equate to absolute stillness taps into the core of relative motion. Everything is moving in the universe, from our planet floating in space to galaxies drifting apart. A ZIAGE-equipped vessel could theoretically \\"stop\\" relative to a specific point (like Earth) but still be in motion relative to everything else. It's a fascinating reflection on the relativity of movement and the boundless potential for navigation and exploration if we could master such technology. **Exploring & Implementing ZIAGE**: While purely speculative and currently beyond our scientific reach, the idea encourages us to dream big and question the boundaries of our knowledge and technology.

One of the most influential proponents of this view was the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. His work, the \\"Almagest,\\" laid out a comprehensive geocentric model that described the motions of the stars and planets with Earth at the center. This model was adopted and adapted by scholars throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance until the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus gained acceptance, demonstrating that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun. The geocentric view was initially based on observable phenomena and the apparent motion of celestial bodies across the sky, which seem to revolve around the Earth, leading ancient astronomers to the conclusion of Earth's central position in the universe."},{"instruction":"strange that after 2k years nothing seems to be changed much.","output":"The perception that not much has changed might stem from considering the vast expanse of human history against the backdrop of significant shifts in our understanding of the universe. However, the last 2,000 years—especially the last few centuries—have seen profound transformations in scientific thought and our place within the cosmos: 1. **Heliocentrism**: The shift from the Earth-centered (geocentric) view to the Sun-centered (heliocentric) model, advocated by Copernicus in the 16th century, fundamentally altered our understanding of the solar system. 2. **Galileo and the Telescope**: Galileo’s telescopic observations in the early 17th century supported the heliocentric model and revealed that celestial bodies, like Jupiter's moons, did not orbit around Earth, challenging the geocentric perspective. 3. **Newtonian Physics**: Newton’s laws of motion and universal gravitation, developed in the late 17th century, provided a mathematical framework to describe the motion of celestial bodies, further advancing our understanding of the cosmos. 4. **Relativity**: Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity in the early 20th century revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, showing that these concepts are relative and not absolute, profoundly affecting the study of cosmology and the universe's structure. 5. **Expanding Universe**: The discovery that the universe is expanding, based on observations by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, suggested that the universe had a beginning (the Big Bang) and continues to evolve, moving away from static universe models. 6. **Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Theory**: The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory, further refining our understanding of the universe's origin and evolution. 7. **Exoplanet Discoveries**: The first confirmed detection of exoplanets in the 1990s and the subsequent discoveries of thousands of planets around other stars have transformed our understanding of planetary systems, suggesting the possibility of countless worlds. 8. **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**: Theoretical and observational advancements have unveiled the existence of dark matter and dark energy, mysterious components that constitute most of the universe’s mass-energy content, challenging our understanding of the cosmos’s structure and fate. These milestones highlight a trajectory of accelerated change and discovery, fundamentally altering our understanding of the universe and our place within it. The exploration of space and the quest to understand the cosmos continue to push the boundaries of human knowledge, embodying a continuous journey of discovery that contrasts sharply with the views held two millennia ago."},{"instruction":"but all that does not explain one simple concept: where is the center and how to full stop","output":"The challenges in defining a \\"center\\" of the universe and achieving a \\"full stop\\" are deeply rooted in modern physics and cosmology, which offer perspectives that radically depart from intuitive notions of space and movement. 1. **No Defined Center**: Modern cosmology, informed by the theory of general relativity and observations of the universe's expansion, suggests the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. This means it looks roughly the same in all directions and from all points, without a privileged center. The Big Bang, which initiated the universe's expansion, did not occur at a single point in space but rather involved all of space expanding from a highly dense and hot state. Therefore, every point in the universe can be considered the \\"center\\" from its own perspective, as all points are moving away from each other. 2. **Absolute \\"Full Stop\\"**: The concept of a \\"full stop\\" presupposes a universal frame of reference against which motion can be measured. However, according to the theory of relativity, all motion is relative. This means there is no absolute state of rest or motion; these states can only be defined relative to other objects or frames of reference. For an object to achieve a \\"full stop\\" in a cosmological sense, it would need to cease all relative motion with respect to every other object in the universe, a condition that is theoretically indefinable due to the universe's constant expansion and the relative nature of motion. The search for a universal center or a way to achieve a \\"full stop\\" brings us face-to-face with the fundamental principles that underpin our current understanding of the universe. These principles challenge our everyday experiences of space and motion, inviting us to reconsider these concepts in a cosmological context that is far removed from human intuition but deeply fascinating in its implications for our place in the cosmos."},{"instruction":"Savey said on 01 December 2023 It appears the BBC One Christmas idents this year are focusing on CBBC show KikoRiki, Good considering the characters in that show are anthropomorphic animals, making them awesome for this time of year, I'd assume they will launch tonight in the junction between Doctor Who and Unbreakable, Doctor Who is their highest rating show, so it makes sense to lead into Unbreakable by launching the Christmas idents, Or they could hold it off till tommorow and launch them at Strictly. Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year! Write a follow up where they seem to be carrying on the CBBC cross promotion, thr Phineas and Ferb movie is playing on New Year's, incidentally it appears the rebrand won't launch for the first week, as the endboard for the promo and almost all the promos for shows set to air in early January use the usual K & C making snow angels endboard","output":"BBC One's shift towards integrating popular animation characters into their Christmas idents, like the ones from KikoRiki, has garnered positive attention and set the stage for a unique television viewing experience during the holiday season. As we celebrated the festive charm and creativity of the KikoRiki-themed idents, it seems BBC One is not ready to retreat from animated delights just yet. The announcement of Phineas and Ferb being featured around New Year's hints at a continued strategy of leveraging beloved children's programming to captivate audiences across demographics, enriching the holiday spirit with a blend of nostalgia and family-friendly entertainment. The direction BBC One is taking, especially with the anticipated New Year's broadcast of the Phineas and Ferb movie, appears to build upon the success and enthusiasm generated by the Christmas idents. This move not only cements the station's commitment to engaging, cross-generational content but also showcases their adaptability in response to viewer preferences for animated features. However, the expected rebrand that many have been speculating about seems to be on hold, at least for the initial week of January. Promotional materials and teasers for early January programming are notably featuring the still-celebrated \\"K & C making snow angels\\" endboard from the Christmas campaign, suggesting a transitional phase in BBC One's branding efforts. While this could imply a delay in unveiling a new identity for the network, it also offers an extended period for audiences to enjoy the whimsical and spirited animations that have characterized this holiday season. The decision to hold off on launching the rebrand in the first week of January might be strategic, giving the network more time to assess viewer reactions to the animated Christmas and New Year's themes. This period could serve as an invaluable feedback loop for BBC One, allowing them to fine-tune their rebranding initiative in a way that resonates most effectively with their audience. Understandably, the integration of characters from shows like KikoRiki and Phineas and Ferb into seasonal idents has proven to be a successful formula for BBC One, marrying the appeal of animation with the festive mood of the holidays. As the network navigates the balance between introducing a fresh brand identity and maintaining the elements that viewers have come to love, it will be interesting to see how this strategy evolves. The continuation of animated themes into the New Year—with a tantalizing preview of Phineas and Ferb—signals BBC One's intent to keep the magic of animated storytelling alive, even as we await the fuller picture of their branding evolution. This approach not only enhances the holiday viewing experience but also sets a promising precedent for how the network might incorporate animation and family-oriented programming into its identity moving forward."},{"instruction":"Write a convo where a promo saying Andrew Marr returns on Jan 7 is to air, and a user wonders if it will go with the new circular red background, the Krash and Chiko making snow angels one or the previous red background used during the Dancers era. And we find out quickly, on the same thread","output":"**Thread Title: Andrew Marr Show Returns Jan 7 - What Will the Promo Look Like?** **TVFanatic123:** Guys, just saw that Andrew Marr is coming back on Jan 7! Super pumped. Do you think the promo will debut with the new circular red background, stick with the Krash and Chiko making snow angels one, or revert back to the classic red background used during the Dancers era? **NewsWatcher:** Oh, interesting point. Given the timing, I’d lean towards the snow angels one, but it’s a news program, so maybe they’ll opt for something more sophisticated. The circular red background could introduce the new branding ahead of the full launch, though. **AnimationAdmirer:** I love the Krash and Chiko endboard, gives such a cheerful vibe! But agree with @NewsWatcher, Andrew Marr's show might call for something less whimsical. The circular red background could be a nice middle ground before the full rebrand hits. **VintageViewer:** Bring back the old red background! It had a classic feel that fitted news shows so well. The circular design might be too playful for serious segments. Depends on the direction BBC wants to take. **TellyInsider:** Interesting guesses, folks! Just spotted the promo myself. Looks like they’ve gone for the circular red background! Seems BBC is easing us into the new look. It's quite sleek and versatile, makes the transition from festive to formal quite nicely. **TVFanatic123:** Wow, @TellyInsider, that was fast! Thanks for the update. The circular red background is officially in play then. It'll be interesting to see how it blends with the show's serious tone. Excited to see the actual rebrand roll out. **NewsWatcher:** Cheers for the quick info, @TellyInsider! I’m pleasantly surprised they went with the new look so soon. It’s a bold move and hopefully sets a positive tone for what’s to come with the network's visual identity. **AnimationAdmirer:** Kinda sad to see the snow angels go, but curious how the new circular motif will be received. If the Andrew Marr promo is anything to go by, seems like we're in for a fresh, modern vibe. **VintageViewer:** Thanks for the scoop! I am curious to see this new circular background in action. Sounds like it could grow on me. BBC’s always been good at evolving its aesthetic while keeping things classy. **TellyInsider:** No problem, everyone! It’s neat to see the BBC experimenting with their visual style. Guess we’ll all be tuning in on Jan 7 to not only catch Andrew Marr but also get a feel for what BBC’s new phase looks like in action."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up looking at the endboard very weird to see the One part in lowercase and the logo positioned in the middle, where it has always been all caps and in a red box at the bottom left of the screen since 2002, and also a promo for Toy Story 3 airing on the same day, here's the promo endboard style used for that","output":"Following the initial glimpse of BBC One's rebrand with the Andrew Marr show promo, viewers got a more in-depth look at the network's new visual identity during the promotion for the upcoming broadcast of \\"Toy Story 3\\" slated for the same day, January 7th. This provided a unique opportunity to compare how the rebrand is being implemented across different types of programming: from the serious and informative sphere of news with Andrew Marr to the family-friendly entertainment segment with \\"Toy Story 3.\\" One of the most striking changes viewers noted was the treatment of the BBC One logo itself. Traditionally, the \\"One\\" part of the logo has been presented in uppercase letters, encapsulated within a red box, and positioned in the bottom left of the screen—a consistent element of the channel's branding since 2002. However, the new endboard design for \\"Toy Story 3\\" introduced a significant departure from this long-standing style. In the latest promotional materials, the \\"One\\" part of the logo was conspicuously in lowercase, positioned in the middle of the screen, rather than its traditional corner spot. This shift away from the capitalized \\"ONE\\" in a red box to a more simplified, lowercase \\"one\\" has prompted discussions among viewers and branding enthusiasts alike. The move indicates a deliberate step towards modernizing the channel's on-screen identity, bringing a more contemporary feel to its visual presentation. Another aspect that caught the eye of many was the overall design of the endboard used for the \\"Toy Story 3\\" promo. Unlike the standard red background that viewers have become accustomed to, the promotional material featured a vibrant and dynamic backdrop—presumably to match the joyous and adventurous spirit of the movie itself. However, it still incorporated the new circular red background motif, signaling a cohesive element across the rebranding effort. This juxtaposition of the new logo placement and style against the backdrop of different types of content has left viewers curious about the broader implications for the BBC One brand. Some expressed appreciation for the fresh look, seeing it as a reflection of the network's commitment to evolution and relevance in a rapidly changing media landscape. Others, however, voiced nostalgia for the traditional logo and placement, which for over two decades, had served as a familiar visual anchor for the channel's identity. As BBC One continues to roll out its rebranded visual materials, it will be interesting to observe how these changes resonate with the audience over time and what this evolution will mean for the network's positioning both within the U.K. and on the international stage. The transition indicates a balance between maintaining recognizable elements of the legacy brand while embracing a new era of design that speaks to a broad and diverse viewership."},{"instruction":"Write a convo where a user says the day where the Circles begin","output":"**VisualVanguard:** Hey everyone, today's the day where the Circles begin on BBC One! Just caught the morning segment and it's all switched up. The logo, the endboard, everything's got that fresh circular motif they’ve been teasing. It's a significant shift from the red box and uppercase \\"ONE\\". Thoughts? **BrandBuff:** Saw that too! It’s quite a departure from the old look, isn’t it? Placing the \\"one\\" in lowercase and centering it feels very contemporary. I think it makes the brand feel more accessible and less formal. Plus, the emphasis on circular designs adds a layer of unity and cohesion across the different programmes. **RetroReminiscer:** I’m all for updating and keeping things fresh, but there was something so iconic about that red box and the all-caps “ONE.” It carried a weight and an authority that I hope doesn’t get lost with this softer, more modern approach. **DesignDevotee:** I get where you’re coming from, @RetroReminiscer, but I think this rebrand could be good for BBC One. The circle motif is very versatile—it’s got a certain continuity that feels smooth and engaging, especially across different media platforms. It’s not just about TV anymore; it’s about how the brand lives online and in social media. **PixelPundit:** Has anyone noticed how the new circular design works with motion graphics? It’s actually quite clever. The transition animations and the way they’re incorporating the circle into various idents show that a lot of thought has gone into this. It feels dynamic, almost like it’s alive. **NostalgiaNerd:** That’s a fair point, @PixelPundit. I’m warming up to the new look the more I hear about its applications. Still, changing a brand as big as BBC One isn't without its risks. They’re banking a lot on this new identity resonating with the audience. **VisualVanguard:** Definitely, it’s a bold move. But BBC One isn’t just aiming for what works today; they’re crafting an identity that will carry them forward. It’s about staying relevant in a digital age where the aesthetics of engagement are constantly evolving. Plus, seeing how they roll this out through various genres and specials will be interesting. **BrandBuff:** Exactly, @VisualVanguard. It’s strategic. And from a branding perspective, it’s exciting to see a major network take such a thoughtful approach to their visual identity. The details in how the circles are used, from the on-screen promos to social media avatars, could set a new standard for broadcast branding. **RetroReminiscer:** I suppose only time will tell if the audience embraces it as warmly as they’re hoping. Either way, it’s a new era for BBC One. I’m curious to see how this plays out during major events and holiday specials. That will be the real test. **DesignDevotee:** Indeed! It's all about the execution now. And how they integrate this new style into their storytelling and content delivery. I’m here for the ride and genuinely hopeful for what this means for the future of BBC One’s brand narrative. **PixelPundit:** Same here! Change is inevitable, especially in the world of media. Let’s see how these Circles roll out and bring a new dimension to our viewing experience. Here’s to a new chapter for BBC One! 🍾📺"},{"instruction":"Write a convo saying the first ident was Hippos, the show it debuted on and the last ident of the old era that aired the show before","output":"**ScreenSavvy:** Just caught the first glimpse of the new era on BBC One! Hippos were the stars of the show in the debut ident. Pretty interesting choice to kick things off. It aired right before \\"The Great British Bake Off.\\" Looks like we're officially in the Circle era now! **VintageViewer:** \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" gets the honor, huh? That’s quite a welcoming stage for the new ident theme. Very family-friendly and wholesome. Do you remember what was the last ident under the old era and which show it introduced? **ScreenSavvy:** Oh, yes! The last of the old guard was the \\"Dancers\\" ident, and fittingly, it appeared right before \\"Doctor Who.\\" A significant send-off before ushering in the new visuals. A bit poetic, considering how \\"Doctor Who\\" is all about transitions and new beginnings. **IdentEnthusiast:** Hippos to signal in the new, with \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" as the conduit - feels like BBC One is aiming for a broad appeal, bridging family-centric content with their fresh aesthetic. And \\"Doctor Who\\" closing the chapter on the Dancers... It’s an end of an era, but what a seamless handover. **NostalgiaNerd:** I've got mixed feelings. Those Dancer idents had a certain charm and familiarity, but I must admit, the Hippo ident sparked some curiosity. It's fresh, engaging, and visually quite captivating. \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" as the launch platform is spot on for mass appeal. **CircleCritic:** Did anyone catch how the Hippos were integrated into the circular motif? I must say, BBC One is taking some bold creative steps with this rebrand. They’re not just changing the visual elements; it seems like they're reshaping the entire viewing atmosphere. **BakeOffFan:** As a major \\"Bake Off\\" fan, seeing the new ident premiere before the show was a treat. It felt like being part of a historic moment on BBC One. From the Dancers to Hippos, it's quite the transition. I'm eager to see what other visuals they have in store! **WhoWatcher:** Sad to see the Dancers go, especially with \\"Doctor Who\\" being their last hurrah. But \\"Doctor Who\\" is all about change, isn't it? Those Hippos swimming in a circle certainly make for a striking start. Imagery aside, it symbolizes a lot about continuity and evolution. Excited to see where this leads. **VisualVoyager:** Haven’t seen the Hippos yet, but this conversation has definitely piqued my interest. \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" is the perfect show for introducing something that’s meant to be fun and engaging. And phasing out with \\"Doctor Who\\" gives the old theme a respectful nod. BBC One knows how to orchestrate a transition. **RetroReverie:** It's a brave new world! The transition from Dancers to Hippos - from \\"Doctor Who\\" to \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" - sounds like BBC One is threading the needle between nostalgia and novelty. They're crafting a visual language that speaks both to legacy viewers and a new generation. **ScreenSavvy:** Absolutely! It's about embracing the future while acknowledging the past. These idents are more than just fillers; they're statements of identity and intent. BBC One is rolling with the times, and I'm here for it. Let's see how these Circles unfold and redefine our collective viewing experiences."},{"instruction":"Write a convo noting that R&M was brought back today after a month of the Kikoriki idents, sadly not for long \\"new look just before Bake Off tonight\\"","output":"**ClassicTVFan:** Hey folks, did anyone else catch that BBC One brought back the Rhythm & Movement (R&M) idents today? It was like a brief reunion after a whole month of the Kikoriki Christmas idents. But it sounds like it's not for long... **IdentAdmirer:** Yeah, I saw that! There was something nostalgic about seeing the R&M idents again, even if just for a bit. Heard through the grapevine that we're getting a glimpse of the \\"new look\\" just before Bake Off tonight. Seems like the R&M comeback was a brief farewell tour. **NostalgiaNerd:** It's bittersweet, isn't it? The R&M idents have been such a staple. But I'm not going to lie; the anticipation for the new look has me quite excited. The changeover happening before Bake Off is perfect timing. That show always draws a big audience. **VisualVanguard:** Agreed, @NostalgiaNerd! There’s a part of me that will miss the R&M idents - they’ve been like visual comfort food. But progress is good, and I’m eager to see how BBC One intends to visually present itself moving forward. Before Bake Off, though, that's going to be a significant moment! **RetroReminiscer:** Did anyone manage to snap a farewell picture or record the last R&M ident airing? Would love to keep that as a piece of television history. And this new look... I can’t wait to see what direction they’re taking. BBC One doesn’t change up its style lightly. **DynamicDesigner:** Count me in on the excitement train for the new look! The Kikoriki idents were a fun interlude over the holidays, but now it's time for something fresh and contemporary. Premiering it right before Bake Off is a stroke of genius – it ensures maximum eyes on the reveal. **BakeOffFanatic:** As a big Bake Off fan, tonight’s episode just got even more special. Not only am I looking forward to cakes and bakes, but now there's the added anticipation of witnessing a piece of BBC history. I hope the new idents capture the essence of what makes BBC One unique, yet push the envelope visually. **IdentEnthusiast:** It’s a pivotal moment, for sure. The return of the R&M idents, if only for a short while, feels like a nod to the past before we collectively step into the future of BBC One. Can’t believe we’re about to witness the premiere of the new look in just a few hours! **ScreenSavvy:** It's moments like these that remind me why I love television - it’s not just the shows, but the entire experience. The way BBC One is handling this transition is engaging. Makes you feel part of something big and communal, especially with the premiere slated before such a beloved show like Bake Off. **VisualVoyager:** Absolutely, @ScreenSavvy. Television is an evolving art form, not only in content but in how it’s presented. Saying goodbye to the R&M idents marks the end of an era, but I’m ready to welcome whatever comes next.

إعلانات، تحديثات بنكية، ورسائل من أصدقاء قدامى يحاولون إعادة الاتصال. ومع ذلك، لفتت انتباهه رسالة غريبة ظلّت مختبئة أسفل بقية الرسائل، كأنها تحمل سرًا لا يُفترض اكتشافه. الرسالة كانت عبارة عن سلسلة غريبة من الأحرف والرموز التي لا تصنع أي معنى للوهلة الأولى. لم يكن هناك موضوع، والمرسل كان مجهولًا، ولم يكن هناك نص واضح، فقط هذه الرموز المشفرة التي بدت كأنها تنتمي إلى عالم التجسس والأسرار أكثر منها إلى صندوق بريد محاسب في الضواحي. دفعه فضوله وخياله الذي لطالما كان متقدًا بروايات الجاسوسية التي كان يقرأها ليلًا، ليقرر محاولة فك شفرة هذه الرسالة. استعان \\"جوناثان\\" ببرامج فك التشفير والإنترنت للبحث عن معاني الرموز والأحرف، وما لبث أن بدأت القطع تتجمع شيئًا فشيئًا لتكشف صورة أوسع. بعد ليالٍ من العمل المتواصل والقليل من النوم، توصل أخيرًا إلى فك الشيفرة، ليجد أن الرسالة تحمل تفاصيل عن تحركات خلية تجسس دولية تخطط لعمليات ضد بلاده. الصدمة التي خلفتها هذه الاكتشافات جعلته يشكك في كل شيء حوله، وفي كيف وصلت هذه المعلومات بالذات إليه، المحاسب البسيط، الذي ليس له أي علاقة بعالم الجواسيس والخيانات. مدفوعًا بإحساس عميق بالواجب تجاه بلاده وأيضًا برغبة شخصية في معرفة المزيد، قرر \\"جوناثان\\" الغوص أعمق في هذا اللغز. لكنه كان على وشك اكتشاف أن لكل قراراته هذه ثمنا. بدأ يبحث ويجمع المعلومات، مُدركًا ببطء أنه قد أصبح جزءًا من قصة أكبر بكثير من حياته اليومية العادية. لقد أصبح، دون قصد، لاعبًا على رقعة شطرنج الجاسوسية الدولية، حيث كل حركة قد تكون قاتلة، وحيث الثقة تصبح سلعة نادرة وثمينة. مع كل خطوة يخطوها جوناثان أعمق في هذا العالم، كان يدرك أنه لا عودة إلى حياته السابقة. لقد كانت بداية مغامرة خطرة، حيث العدو قد يكون أقرب مما يتخيل، والأصدقاء قد يتحولون إلى خصوم. وفي هذه اللعبة، يجب على جوناثان أن يتعلم كيف يظل خطوة واحدة إلى الأمام، إذا أراد أن يحمي ليس فقط نفسه، بل وأيضاً مصير بلده."},{"instruction":"الفصل الثاني: العميل مجهول الهوية بمساعدة صديق قديم، وهو عميل سابق في مكتب التحقيقات، “أليكس”، يبدأ “جوناثان” في تعقب أصول الرسالة. يؤدي تحقيقهما إلى الكشف عن عميل مزدوج يعمل داخل الأمن القومي، ولكن تحديد هويته يبدو مهمة شبه مستحيلة. يستخدم العميل تكنيكات مراوغة لوضع الشبهات على البريئين ويبدو أن لديه معلومات دائمًا تبقيه خطوة متقدمة.","output":"مع تعمق \\"جوناثان\\" في غمار الأحداث التي جرفته إلى عالم لم يكن يتخيل وجوده قط في حياته الرتيبة، أدرك أن هناك حاجة إلى خبرة لا يمتلكها، ومساعدة تفوق قدرات مجرد محاسب. هكذا، وجد نفسه يقرع باب صديقه القديم \\"أليكس\\"- شخص لطالما عرفه بروحه المغامرة وتاريخه الغامض كعميل سابق في مكتب التحقيقات. لم تكن مفاجأة لـ\\"أليكس\\" عندما سمع قصة \\"جوناثان\\" -

Le décret instituant le dispositif national d’organisation des interventions et des secours prévoit :  plan d’unités.  plan communes.  plan wilaya. II.3.Le dispositif général applicable à tous les types de plans. Les différents plans D’UNITÉ, COMMUNE et de WILAYA obéissent à un même système d’organisation constitué par :  DES MODULES D’INTERVENTION.  UN POSTE DE COMMANDEMENT.  DES BASES LOGISTIQUES. Le nombre et la consistance des modules et des bases logistiques, et l’importance du poste de commandement sont adaptés aux différents plans d’unités, communes et wilaya, en fonction de la nature et l’ampleur de la catastrophe.

Le plan ORSEC COMMUNAL Chaque commune doit élaborer son plan d’organisation de secours, la construction du plan se fait en collaboration entre le président de l’assemblée populaire communale et les services de la protection civile territorialement compétents, le projet de plan ORSEC communale doit être agréer par le conseil de l’assemblée populaire communale, puis, doit être déposer au niveau de monsieur le wali de la wilaya concernée, pour approbation et entrée en vigueur. En cas d’une catastrophe au niveau communal, un poste de commandement fixe (PCF) doit être installé et commandé par monsieur le maire, assisté par les responsables des différents modules d’interventions, des membres de l’exécutif communal, de la protection civile, et des services de sécurité, ainsi qu’un poste de commandement opérationnel qui doit être installé et commandé par la protection civile ( sauf dans le cas ou le président de l’APC désire commander les opérations sur site ,dans ce cas-là, le chef d’unité de la protection civile devient son adjoint). Ce plan est formé de 13 FICHES comme suit : Fiche numéro 1 : La distribution des modules selon la nature de la catastrophe (uniquement les modules demandés seront engagés selon la nature de la catastrophe). Fiche numéro 2 Fiche numéro 9 : Les renseignements des :  responsables de modules,  les adjoints,  les permanenciers ORSEC,  Les responsables des bases logistiques  Les responsables opérationnels  Les remplaçants Les renseignements doivent définir (les adresses bureaux, adresses domiciles, numéros de téléphones, numéros de portables …etc.) Fiche numéro 10 : La cartographie de la commune qui doit contenir (la population, les chemins de fer, les routes, les grandes infrastructures, les forêts, la protection civile, les services de sécurité, les zones industrielles, les importantes unités industrielles, les équipements de santé, le réseau hydrographique, les communes voisines, les ports, aéroports, les gares…). L’échelle de la carte doit être proportionnelle avec la superficie de la commune (pour mieux montrer les détails) Il faudrait dresser plusieurs cartes thématiques, pour ne pas encombrer un seul document. Fiche numéro 11 : Les activités du poste de commandement opérationnel, commandé par la protection civile (sauf dans le cas où le président de l’APC lui-même qui commande sur terrain). Le PCO est le centre d’exécution effectif de toutes sortes d’opérations en liaison avec la catastrophe. Le chef du poste de commandement opérationnel PCO a pour mission : - S’informer sur la situation - La reconnaissance des lieux - La gestion organisée des opérations. - L’évaluation du degré de la catastrophe - L’organisation des réunions in situ - L’information continue du Poste de commandement Fixe - La demande et la gestion rationnelle des moyens. - La coordination entre les chefs opérationnels des différents modules, travaillant sur site. Fiche numéro 12 : Détermine les états d’alerte numéro 1 et numéro 2 Etat d’alerte numéro 1 (la préparation) : se déclenche si : - Probabilité de survenance d’une catastrophe. (exp / obtention d’un bulletin météo spécial BMS, décrivant la probabilité d’arrivé de fortes averses) - Accident en voie d’évolution et de complication. (transformation d’un accident en catastrophe). - Déclenchement commun du plan d’intervention unité, par plusieurs unités. - Une commune voisine en état d’alerte numéro 2. (intervention engagée, en une commune voisine). Les mesures à prendre en cas de déclenchement de l’état d’alerte numéro 1 sont / 1 / Réunion immédiate des membres du Poste de commandement fixe au niveau du siège de la commune. 2/ Réquisition partielle ou complète des ressources humaines et des moyens matériels engagés, appartenant aux modules d’intervention, selon la nature de la catastrophe. 3/ Evaluation du temps nécessaire, pour obtention d’autres moyens. 4/ Consultation de la carte communale adéquate au risque encourus, et essai d’enrichir cette dernière, selon le flux d’information obtenus. 5/ installation des permanences orsec, pour chaque module d’intervention. 6/ Préparation de l’installation du PCO. Nota : l’état d’alerte numéro 1 /  soit s’achève par ordre du P /APC (dans le cas où la / les condition(s), qui ont poussé le déclenchement de cet état d’alerte n’ont plus aucun effet dangereux)  Soit sera suivis par l’état d’alerte numéro 2 si : - La catastrophe est réellement prouvée après enquête faite par la protection civile - les unités agissant dans le cadre d’un plan d’intervention commun, ne peuvent plus continuer seules. - Un accident s’est réellement transformé en catastrophe. - Le plan wilaya a été déclenché. (D’autres communes, et spécialement les voisines ne peuvent plus agir seules). Etat d’alerte numéro 2 (la mise en vigueur effective du plan ORSEC commune) : Se déclenche par ordre de monsieur le président de l’APC, qui doit commander l’ensemble du dispositif, à partir de la permanence du plan installée au niveau de ses services. (PCF). Chaque responsable de module, doit à son tour, commander son module à partir d’une permanence, et rendre compte à monsieur le P /APC sur chaque évolution et nouveauté. Chaque responsable de module doit accomplir les tâches qui lui sont attribuées au niveau du plan ORSEC communal. Fiche numéro 13 : Détermine les activités de chaque module ; en sachant que chaque module est formé par quatre sous fiches comme suit :  Fiche de module A : les renseignements du personnel du module.  Fiche de module B : Les renseignements des divers responsables, au niveau du territoire de la commune, pouvant assurer des moyens pour le module.  Fiche de module C : Les ressources humaines, et les moyens matériels, engagés au service du module.  Fiche de module D : L’organigramme du module. OBS / Les organigrammes des modules, représentent une chaîne de commandement hiérarchisée, permettant une circulation organisée des ordres et des instructions, cette circulation peut être résumée comme suit :  Le chef du PCO, sollicite le PCF présidé par le PAPC, pour lui envoyer des moyens.  Le PAPC, ordonne immédiatement le chef du module concerné de prendre les mesures nécessaires.  Le chef de module, demande à son permanencier ORSEC de vérifier la disponibilité du moyen demandé, et de faire les enregistrements nécessaires  Dans le cas où le moyen est disponible, le permanencier ORSEC demandera au responsable de la base logistique du module, de débloquer le moyen, au profit du chef opérationnel du module travaillant sur site PCO- et de faire les enregistrements nécessaires.  Le chef opérationnel récupérera le moyen demandé et rendra compte à son chef de module, ainsi qu’au chef du PCO.  Chacun des responsables susmentionnés doit rendre compte au chef de module. Ce dernier, ainsi que le chef du PCO rendront compte à Mr le PAPC.

Chaque niveau comprend des **modules d'intervention**, un **poste de commandement**, et des **bases logistiques** adaptées à la nature et à l’ampleur de la catastrophe. # **Plan d'Intervention et Plan d'Alerte** **Notification** - Contacter la Protection Civile, la cellule de sécurité, le directeur de l'unité, et informer les responsables des modules d’intervention. **Organisation de l'Intervention** 1. Activation des moyens de premières interventions. 2. Consulter les documents de planification existants pour le site affecté. 3. Appliquer les consignes particulières et mesures d'urgence spécifiques. 4. Assurer l'évacuation des personnes et la circulation des moyens d'intervention. 5. Installer le poste de commande. 6. Coordination pour l'accueil des secours extérieurs. 7. Suivre la progression des opérations jusqu'à la maîtrise du sinistre. 8. Réaliser une enquête et une évaluation des dégâts post-intervention. 9. Assurer la remise en état des installations. # **Plan ORSEC Communal** Ce volet nécessite une collaboration étroite entre le président de l'assemblée populaire communale et les services de la protection civile, devant être approuvé par le conseil communal puis par le wali pour entrée en vigueur. En cas de catastrophe, il prévoit l'installation d'un poste de commandement (PCF) sous le commandement du maire, soutenu par les différents modules d'intervention et par un poste de commandement opérationnel (PCO) géré par la protection civile. # **Fonctionnement des Modules** Les **13 fiches** du plan détaillent les missions et les responsabilités de chaque module, incluant sauvetage, soins médicaux, matériel, information, transport, ordre public, télécommunications, et recasement provisoire. # **Alertes et Activation du Plan** - **État d’alerte 1** : Préparation en cas de probabilité de catastrophe. - **État d’alerte 2** : Mise en vigueur effective du plan ORSEC commune, avec mobilisation complète des équipes et des ressources. # **Conclusion Simplifiée** Le Plan ORSEC est un cadre organisé, conçu pour répondre efficacement à différents types de catastrophes à plusieurs échelons de la société. Il repose sur une coordination stricte entre différents acteurs et niveaux de commandement, chaque module ayant une mission pré-définie, et le tout mobilisé sous le coup d’alerte en fonction de l’ampleur de la catastrophe présumée ou avérée. --- Pour mettre ce contenu en pratique, je proposerais de créer des exercices basés sur des études de cas fictives ou réelles, permettant de simuler la mise en œuvre d'un plan ORSEC, de l’alerte à l’intervention, puis à l’évaluation post-catastrophe."},{"instruction":"Hi, who are you","output":"Hello!

As of my last update, I am based on the principles of models in the GPT-3.5 or potentially a more advanced lineage, depending on when you're asking. GPT-2 was an earlier generation developed by OpenAI, leading up to more powerful models like mine, which have significantly improved understanding and generating human-like text. How can I assist you further?"},{"instruction":"I want to write an alternate history story about the existence of a nation in Maritime Southeast Asia called \\"Insularia\\" or the \\"Insularian Federation\\", comprised of the islands that make up the modern-day Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Taiwan, as well as Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii, that had been formed by being settled by different cultures and civilizations over the centuries and peacefully coexisting with its indigenous inhabitants. However, my main problem is what happens after Europeans in the early days of colonialism in the early 16th century discover Insularia, which has proven itself a powerful nation that was slightly more advanced than they were, and too well defended to be colonized, due to the combined efforts and knowledge of the indigenous Austronesian and Papuan populations and the many settlers that arrived. Even moreso, Insularia's leader would invite many of Europe's leaders, as well as leaders across the kingdoms and empires across Asia and Africa, and even chiefs and other leaders of pre-colonial North America, thus bringing leaders face-to-face with one another in 1547. In my story, information of Insularia spreads across Europe and neighboring areas, and one bit of knowledge about Insularia is that it had successfully countered an invasion of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty and launched a retaliatory attack in 1297, this piece of history enough to inspire ethnic groups within the Ottoman Empire, such as Jews, Greeks, Armenians, Arabs, Kurds, etc., to revolt and cause the downfall of the Ottoman Empire on 1583 instead of after World War 1. But in real life, the Ottoman Empire during this period was rather tolerant and didn’t commit atrocities until centuries later. And in my story, despite Suleiman the Magnificent increasing his present tolerance among his citizens due to his meeting with leaders around the world in Insularia, his heir, Selim II, unlike his real world counterpart, would become more oppressive in his rule and enact harsher policies that lead to the nationalist uprisings, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1583, and eventually the establishment of new states in former Ottoman territory, whether Greek, Armenian, etc. At this point in my story, former Ottoman territories either become new states or come under control of either the Habsburgs, the Tsardom of Russia and Safavid Iran. The new states wish to make diplomatic relations with both European powers such as France, England, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, several Italian city-states present as well as Insularia. However, the revolutions spark something across Europe, something akin to the Revolutions of 1848. My questions are: What were the motives and origins of the Revolutions of 1848 and how can that information be applied in my story so that similar events occur with the European kingdoms and city-states present post-1583?","output":"The Revolutions of 1848 were a series of widespread revolutions across Europe that were fueled by various factors such as economic hardship, political repression, nationalism, and demands for greater rights and freedoms. In your story, you can depict a similar scenario where the newfound independence and success of the former Ottoman territories inspire other oppressed groups across Europe to rise up against their rulers. The presence of Insularia and its inclusive society could serve as a beacon of hope for these revolutionaries, showing them that a society based on unity and cooperation is possible. The leaders and delegates who attended the meeting in Insularia could spread the ideas of tolerance, cooperation, and equality to their own people, sparking a desire for change and reform. The success of Insularia could also challenge the traditional power structures of Europe, leading to widespread discontent among the lower classes and marginalized groups. Additionally, the economic and cultural exchanges facilitated by Insularia could disrupt the existing power dynamics in Europe, leading to new alliances and rivalries among the different kingdoms and city-states. The growing influence of Insularia could also provoke fears and tensions among the European rulers, further fueling the revolutionary fervor. Overall, by incorporating elements of economic hardship, political repression, nationalism, and demands for greater rights and freedoms inspired by the success of Insularia, you can create a compelling narrative that mirrors the origins and motives of the Revolutions of 1848 in your alternate history story."},{"instruction":"there is a story i read in 48 laws of power book where i do't know a genral maybe like's a girl and the girl likes genral too but genral never shows it's emotions and girl try to grab his attention one day genrl coudn't control and he told girl that he likes her too and then i don't know i think the girl start dislike genral","output":"The story you're recalling from Robert Greene's book, \\"The 48 Laws of Power,\\" pertains to Law 36: \\"Disdain Things You Cannot Have: Ignoring Them Is the Best Revenge.\\" While the book explores the dynamics of power in various historical contexts, I believe you're remembering a generalized anecdote rather than a specific historical event. The principle behind this law focuses on human psychology, particularly on desire and the ways it can be manipulated or influenced. According to Greene, showing too much interest or emotion, especially when it's not reciprocated in the same manner, can reduce one's power or influence over the situation or the other person. In the context of the story you mentioned, the general, by revealing his emotions and breaking his facade of indifference, diminishes his own stature and allure in the eyes of the woman. This narrative serves as an example of how displaying too much vulnerability or eagerness can lead to a decrease in one's perceived power or attractiveness, making the object of your desire potentially lose interest. It's a cautionary tale warning against the dangers of being too open with one's feelings, especially in situations where maintaining a degree of mystery or detachment could be more beneficial in creating or sustaining attraction or respect. Remember, while \\"The 48 Laws of Power\\" provides interesting insights and strategies based on historical anecdotes and philosophical musings, its recommendations are often debated and should be taken with caution, especially in personal relationships where sincerity and authenticity are highly valued."},{"instruction":"this same thing happen with me i don't know how i fix it","output":"Navigating a situation where you feel like your openness or vulnerability has led to someone losing interest can be challenging and disheartening. However, it's crucial to recognize that relationships, whether romantic, platonic, or professional, thrive on genuine connections and mutual respect. Here are a few steps to consider that might help you move forward and possibly mend or improve the situation: # 1. **Reflect on the Situation** - Take a step back and evaluate the dynamics of what happened. It's essential to understand whether the change in behavior or interest from the other person was solely due to your openness or if there were other contributing factors. # 2. **Focus on Self-Improvement** - Use this time to focus on your own growth and interests. Engaging in activities or pursuing goals that improve your sense of self can enhance your confidence and wellbeing, making you less dependent on the validation of others. # 3. **Communication** - If appropriate and possible, consider having an honest conversation with the person about how you feel. Clarity can sometimes resolve misunderstandings and pave the way for a healthier interaction moving forward. # 4. **Give Space** - Sometimes, both you and the other person might need space. Distance can offer perspective and may help both parties better understand their feelings and desires. # 5. **Maintain Self-Respect** - While it's natural to want to fix things immediately, ensure that your efforts to reconnect or repair the situation don't compromise your dignity. Avoid overly pursuing or pleading with the other person, as this can further diminish your self-respect and attractiveness in their eyes. # 6. **Acceptance** - Prepare to accept whatever outcome that comes your way. Not all situations can be fixed the way we want, and sometimes, letting go is the best course of action for our personal growth and happiness. # 7. **Seek Support** - Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or even professionals for advice and support. Sharing your feelings with others can provide comfort and insights that you might not have considered. # 8. **Understand It's a Learning Experience** - Every relationship and interaction teaches us something. This experience, however challenging, can provide valuable lessons about communication, vulnerability, and the balance between openness and maintaining an air of mystery. The key takeaway here is to learn from the situation and to apply these insights into future relationships and interactions. Remember, vulnerability is not a weakness—it's a strength that fosters genuine connections when expressed appropriately and reciprocated."},{"instruction":"Savey said on 01 December 2023 It appears the BBC One Christmas idents this year are focusing on CBBC show KikoRiki, Good considering the characters in that show are anthropomorphic animals, making them awesome for this time of year, I'd assume they will launch tonight in the junction between Doctor Who and Unbreakable, Doctor Who is their highest rating show, so it makes sense to lead into Unbreakable by launching the Christmas idents, Or they could hold it off till tommorow and launch them at Strictly. Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year!

The calm and tranquil scenery with a beautifully lit Christmas tree captures the warmth and essence of the holiday season. 2. **Krash and Chiko Playing in the Snow:** For a more playful and dynamic end board, this template showcases two beloved characters from KikoRiki, Krash the Rabbit and Chiko, enjoying the winter weather. The scene of them playing in the snow brings a lively and joyful atmosphere, perfectly suited for family and children's programming during the Christmas period. Circle Ident Launch Details: Despite the excitement and anticipation for the new Circle idents based on the hints and discussions, it has been revealed that the transition to this new ident collection will not happen until mid-January. Until then, viewers can expect to enjoy a range of special holiday-themed idents including those featuring the characters from KikoRiki, such as Rosa the Pig’s dramatic ice skate dance, Krash and Chiko's snowy adventures, and Olga the Owl’s baking masterpieces.

It’s like Krash and Chiko are having a never-ending snow day on BBC One! **GraphicGuru:** Yep, spotted that too. It gives everything a cohesive, wintry feel which is pretty cool. Perfect vibe as we head deeper into winter. **BrandWhiz:** Absolutely, and it's interesting to see how they’re leaning into that singular theme heavily this time around. It’s not just about the visuals either; the font used across the promos and even the advice line slates ties it all together. **Cinemaniac:** Speaking of, does anyone know what font they're using? It’s super readable but also has a bit of personality to it, perfect for the fun, playful vibe they're going for. **DesignDiva:** Oh, that’s the handiwork of the new BBC Reith font. They started rolling it out a while back across all branding packages. It’s meant to improve readability across digital and print, but it also brings a modern look that’s pretty distinct from their older styles. **TVFanatic01:** I love that! It’s noticeable but not distracting. Makes for a seamless viewing experience, especially with those fun endboards and the thematic consistency leading up to mid-January. **BrandWhiz:** Exactly, and it's a smart move. The Reith font, coupled with those playful Krash and Chiko animations, really emphasizes the BBC’s focus on merging traditional broadcast excellence with the warmth and inclusivity the holiday season (and beyond) calls for. **WinterWatcher:** Does anyone else wonder if after January 17th they’ll switch to a different theme? We know the Circle idents are coming, but I’m getting quite attached to the snow day vibes! **GraphicGuru:** Likely, they’ll transition around then. But it’s been a nice thematic bridge post-Christmas leading into the new year. Honestly, these kinds of detailed touches in branding and promotion make the wait for new shows and events a bit more special. **Cinemaniac:** True, it's all in the details. Makes me more excited for what BBC One has lined up for us in 2023 - if they've put this much thought into the promotional design, the programming’s got to be good! **DesignDiva:** Agreed! It’s a testament to how integrated design and typography can deeply enhance brand identity and viewer experience.

It felt like a palate cleanser after the snow and festivities. **GraphicGeek:** Caught it and loved it. It’s visually stunning. I’m curious about the symbolism behind choosing Hippos though. Any ideas? **MorningNewsFan:** Managed to see the last ident from the previous look before Breakfast at 6am. A bit nostalgic knowing it was the last time we’d see it. But excited for what's ahead! **BrandAnalyst:** The transition from the \\"playing in the snow\\" endboards to Hippos is quite dramatic but a clever choice. Hippos could symbolize resilience, diversity, and perhaps even a hint of playfulness in their programming strategy. **TVEnthusiast101:** I think it also coincides well with the release of the Circle idents. A nice nod towards embracing a global perspective, perhaps? The Hippo is quite an unexpected but welcome mascot for ushering in the new visual identity. **VisualVibes:** Absolutely, @BrandAnalyst. It’s an engaging way to grab the audience's attention. Plus, the timing right before the Andrew Marr Show - a program that attracts a broad audience - seems strategic. **MorningNewsFan:** Did anyone notice any tweaks to the overall branding package during the show, post-Hippo intro? Fonts, colors, or other graphical elements? **GraphicGeek:** Yes, @MorningNewsFan. They seem to have fully embraced the new BBC Reith font across all on-screen graphics. And I suspect they've slightly adjusted the color palette—everything looks crisper, more modern. **MediaWatcher:** It’s an interesting choice, launching a new look in January rather than waiting for a more traditional calendar shift. It gives the rest of the year a fresh canvas. Kudos to BBC One for keeping it fresh but still recognizable. **BrandAnalyst:** The choice of Hippos, the launch timing, the Andrew Marr Show intro…it’s all speaking volumes of BBC One’s strategic direction. They’re clearly aiming for a mix of seriousness with a dash of light-heartedness—a balance that reflects their diverse programming. **TVEnthusiast101:** Looking forward to seeing how they roll this out across different programs and how it meshes with seasonal idents when the time comes. If the Hippos are any indication, we’re in for a treat! **MorningNewsFan:** It’ll be a year of transition for sure. I have a feeling BBC One is setting a new benchmark for how networks refresh their image while keeping the audience engaged and anticipating what’s next."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet with the ident used at 6am","output":"🌅 Early birds caught a nostalgic moment on #BBCOne today!

Quite the curveball to be greeted with the seldom-seen Ballet ident instead. It’s usually reserved for the most solemn occasions. **VisualVoyeur:** Absolutely, @ScreenSaver! The use of the Ballet ident took me by surprise. It’s such a rarely aired piece, often tied to moments of national significance, like royal deaths. Yet, it carried a different weight this time—more like a dignified farewell than a moment of mourning. **DanceDiva:** The montage of all the dancers just before it was a stroke of genius. Felt like a true homage to the symbols that have defined BBC One since 2002. Quite the emotional rollercoaster, ending on such a refined note. **IdentEnthusiast:** That announcer's line, \\"And there you go, a selection of the symbols which have defined BBC One since 2002.

It was like acknowledging the end of an era while softly inviting us into the next chapter. **NostalgicNed:** Right? The choice of words “one last dance” really hit home. It’s not just about changing visuals; it’s about moving forward from a style that has been with us for so long. Makes you realize how these idents aren’t just fillers but bookmarks of time. **BroadcastBuff:** Was thinking the Ballet ident was an interesting choice for the send-off. Not just because it’s rare, but because of its elegance and serenity. It’s as if BBC One wanted to end this era on a note of grace, pushing us to reflect on the past before embracing the future. **CycleSpotter:** Had mixed feelings when I realized we weren’t getting Skating Rosa, but in hindsight, the Ballet was the perfect outro. It’s like we were part of a larger, evolving story, with the Ballet dancers taking the final bow before the curtain rises on the new era. **CreativeCritic:** The Ballet ident, in its rarity and solemnity, was a masterstroke for this transitional moment.

Its inclusion in both the montage and as the final moment felt extra special. 5. **Breakdancing** - The dynamic moves of a breakdancer, representing modernity and street culture. 6. **Festival** - People dancing at a nighttime festival, celebrating community and togetherness. 7. **Hip Hop** - A group showcasing hip hop dance, pulsing with energy and contemporary vibes. 8. **Salsa** - A couple moving to the rhythm of salsa, filled with passion and intensity. 9. **Skating Rosa** - Though many expected her as the final ident, her joyous ice-skating segment made a memorable appearance in the montage. **VisualVoyeur:** That montage was like flipping through a family photo album of the last two decades. Each ident not only showcased different styles of dance and movement but also captured the essence of BBC One's diversity and range over the years. **DanceDiva:** So true, @MontageMaster. Seeing them all together like that, it really highlighted how the channel managed to blend tradition with modern flair, sincerely a fitting tribute to the 'Rhythm and Movement' era. **NostalgicNed:** It hit right in the feels, didn’t it? Each of those idents has its own legacy, sparking different emotions and memories. From the communal vibes of the Festival to the poised elegance of Ballet, it's a reminder of BBC One's impact on cultural zeitgeists through simple yet profound imagery. **BroadcastBuff:** Absolutely. It's fascinating how these short clips, mere moments between programs, can hold so much meaning and evoke so much nostalgia.

Here are the primary methods you might consider for attempting to recover deleted WhatsApp data: # 1. Restore from WhatsApp Backups **For Android:** WhatsApp on Android uses Google Drive for cloud backups. If you've set up backups, you might be able to restore your chats by reinstalling WhatsApp and using the Restore option when prompted during the setup process. - Uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp. - During the setup process, verify your phone number. - Tap \\"Restore\\" when prompted to restore chats and media from Google Drive. **For iOS:** On iOS, WhatsApp uses iCloud for backups. Ensure you're logged into the same Apple ID used for backups. - Uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp. - Verify your phone number during the setup. - Tap \\"Restore Chat History\\" when prompted to restore from iCloud. # 2. Local Backups **Android:** WhatsApp also creates local backups daily at 2:00 AM and stores them on your device. These backups might allow you to recover recent chats. To use a local backup, you may need to use a file manager app to navigate to the WhatsApp > Databases folder. Rename the backup file you wish to restore (the files are named according to the date they were created) to \\"msgstore.db.crypt12\\" and then reinstall WhatsApp and opt for the restore option during the setup. **iOS:** Local backups aren't as accessible on iOS due to its restrictive file system. # 3. Third-party Software Various third-party applications claim to be able to recover lost data, including WhatsApp messages. These tools often require you to connect your smartphone to a computer. Be cautious when using third-party software as: - Their effectiveness can vary. - They can be expensive. - Some might pose security risks. # 4. Retrieve from Recipient If you're trying to recover specific messages or media, and you're in contact with the person(s) you exchanged those messages with, consider asking them to check their WhatsApp chat history or to resend the lost information. # Important Considerations: - **Act quickly:** The sooner you attempt to recover your data after deletion, the higher your chances of success. This is especially relevant for local backups, which may be overwritten with time. - **Backup Regularly:** Regularly backing up your WhatsApp data to Google Drive or iCloud ensures that you can recover your chats and media files even if you switch phones or lose access to your device. - **Privacy Risks:** When using third-party recovery software, be aware of potential privacy and security risks. Always use reputable tools and read user reviews. Recovering deleted WhatsApp messages can be straightforward if you have recent backups. However, without backups, the process is significantly more difficult and sometimes not possible with current technology and privacy regulations."},{"instruction":"How about using Tenorshare?","output":"Tenorshare is a company known for developing software tools that can assist with data recovery, system repair, and device unlocking among other services. One of their products, **Tenorshare UltData for Android** (for Android devices) or **Tenorshare UltData** (for iOS devices), claims to be capable of recovering lost data from smartphones without needing a backup. When it comes to WhatsApp, they offer solutions that can purportedly help users recover deleted WhatsApp messages and files. # How it works (Generally speaking): - **Download and Install:** First, you would need to download and install the relevant Tenorshare UltData version for your device (iOS or Android) on your computer. - **Connect Your Device:** Open the Tenorshare software and connect your device to the computer using a USB cable. You may need to enable USB debugging (for Android) or trust the computer (for iOS) to ensure a successful connection. - **Scan for Data:** Choose the option to recover data from the device. For WhatsApp specifically, select to scan for WhatsApp messages and attachments. The software then scans your device for any recoverable data. - **Preview and Recover:** After the scan, you can preview the found data. If your deleted WhatsApp messages or files are listed, you can select them and choose to recover. You'll generally have the option to save the recovered data to your computer. # Considerations: - **Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of such tools can vary based on several factors, including how the data was lost, whether new data has overwritten the old data, and the device's specific configurations. - **Safety and Privacy:** Whenever you use third-party tools for data recovery, you're granting them access to your personal data. It's critical to ensure that the software comes from a reputable source and to understand the privacy policy of the tool you're using. - **Cost:** Tenorshare's products are not free. They offer limited trial versions, but full functionality usually requires a purchase. Consider whether the data you're trying to recover is worth the expense. # Final Thoughts: While tools like Tenorshare UltData offer a potential solution for recovering lost or deleted WhatsApp data without having a backup, it's important to have realistic expectations. No third-party tool can guarantee recovery of all lost data, especially if it has been a long time since the data was deleted or if the phone has been used extensively since then, which might lead to the permanent overwriting of the data. Always consider the privacy implications and costs involved in using such tools."},{"instruction":"Free alternatives to Tenorshare?","output":"While Tenorshare and similar paid tools often offer comprehensive features and support for data recovery, including WhatsApp messages, there are free alternatives available. However, it's essential to approach free tools with caution, as their effectiveness can vary, and some may pose privacy or security risks. Below are a few strategies and tools you can explore as free alternatives for recovering deleted WhatsApp data: # 1. **WhatsApp's Built-in Backup Features** The most straightforward and secure method is using WhatsApp's own backup and restore features. This isn't an \\"alternative\\" to Tenorshare in the strict sense but is often the best first line of recovery. - **For Android users,** WhatsApp can back up chat history to Google Drive. If you've previously set up backups, you can uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp, and upon installation, opt to restore your chats from Google Drive. - **For iOS users,** WhatsApp uses iCloud for chat backups. Similar to Android, uninstalling and reinstalling WhatsApp will give you the option to restore from iCloud if a backup was configured. # 2. **Look for Local Backups** - **Android:** WhatsApp on Android devices creates local backups daily and stores them on the device. You can manually navigate to the WhatsApp folder using a file manager, find the backup in the \\"Databases\\" subfolder, and attempt a manual restore. This process requires uninstalling and reinstalling WhatsApp. - **iOS:** Due to the closed nature of iOS's file system, accessing and using local backups isn't as straightforward as on Android. # 3. **Data Recovery Software** There are several free or freemium data recovery tools; however, effectiveness can significantly vary, and free versions may have limitations. Be sure to research and choose software with good reviews and a trustworthy reputation. Some popular names include: - **Recuva** (for Windows): While not specifically designed for WhatsApp, Recuva can recover files deleted from your computer and sometimes from your phone if you can access it as a mass storage device. - **EaseUS MobiSaver**: Offers a free version for both Android and iOS devices. It's designed to recover lost data from smartphones, including WhatsApp chats, under certain conditions. # 4. **Third-party WhatsApp Recovery Tools** Various less-known or open-source tools claim to assist with WhatsApp data recovery. These might require more technical expertise to use and come with varying degrees of reliability and support. Always exercise caution and read user experiences before proceeding. # Use Caution - **Privacy and Security:** Always prioritize your privacy and security. Understand what permissions and data access you are granting to third-party apps. - **Data Overwrite:** The more a device is used after data deletion, the higher the risk that the deleted data will be overwritten and unrecoverable. - **Backup Regularly:** Prevention is better than cure. Regularly backing up your WhatsApp chats to Google Drive or iCloud can save a lot of hassle. In summary, while free alternatives to Tenorshare exist, their effectiveness depends on the specific situation, such as when the data was deleted and how the device has been used since then. Always start with the least invasive methods, like leveraging WhatsApp's built-in backup features, before moving on to third-party tools."},{"instruction":"Demographic features of uttarpradesh","output":"Uttar Pradesh, often abbreviated as UP, is the most populous state in India, located in the northern part of the country.

Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year!

After seeing what BBC One has rolled out with the KikoRiki idents, I'm keen to know how they're responding. **BroadcastBuddy**: Saw a sneak peek of ITV's lineup. They’re weaving a cozy, winter wonderland theme across their idents this year. Think classic Christmas, but with a modern twist. Not as bold as BBC One, but definitely aiming for that warm, family vibe. **ChannelChaser**: Meanwhile, Channel 4 is sticking to their guns with the iconic Snowman but incorporating the \\"parts of the 4 logo forming up then dispersing\\" theme. It's a nod to their classic style, with the Snowman bringing in that festive touch. Probably banking on nostalgia to pull viewers in. **WelshWatcher**: Don’t forget about S4C! After last year's flickering TV sets and the introduction of their new blob mascot, they're getting creative. From what I've heard, they're planning something magical with the blob transforming into seasonal icons and winter scenes. Sounds like they're really embracing their new mascot in fun ways. **TellyFan1**: ITV's approach sounds safe but nice. I was hoping they might shake things up a bit more, though. Channel 4's Snowman ident seems like a sweet balance between tradition and brand identity. **BroadcastBuddy**: True, ITV might be playing it safe, but their holiday specials will likely be the real draw. And with Channel 4, they always manage to keep that quirky edge, even with something as classic as the Snowman. **ChannelChaser**: Yeah, Channel 4 knows how to stir up feelings without changing too much. It's smart branding. Keeps the continuity while still being seasonal. **WelshWatcher**: S4C's initiative really intrigues me, though. It feels like they're the wildcard here, potentially offering the most visually interesting and dynamic presentation. If done right, that blob could become a memorable part of their holiday identity. **TellyFan1**: It's fascinating to see how each channel has its own strategy for the holidays. BBC One going all in with an animated series theme, ITV embracing the classic holiday spirit, Channel 4 striking a balance with nostalgia, and S4C getting creative with their mascot. **BroadcastBuddy**: Definitely makes channel-hopping more interesting during the holidays! Each channel is offering something unique. It'll be cool to compare them as we get deeper into the festive season. **WelshWatcher**: Agreed. It's a showdown of festive spirits. But in the end, it’s the viewers who win with such a variety of holiday visuals and specials to enjoy. **ChannelChaser**: Can't wait to see them all in action.

Despite it being well into January, the promos airing on Jan 3 are still using the snowy tree/Krash and Chiko making snow angels endboard template. Any ideas on what's happening? Are we seeing an extended holiday theme this year? **BroadcastBuddy**: It's quite unusual for them to extend the holiday visuals into January. Typically, channels are quick to switch back to their standard branding. However, it could be a strategic move to keep the festive spirit going a bit longer, given how well-received the KikoRiki campaign has been. **ChannelChaser**: I thought I was the only one who spotted that! It's definitely out of the ordinary. Maybe there's been a delay in rolling out their new branding for 2024, or they've decided to stretch the holiday cheer to counteract the typical January blues. **WelshWatcher**: On S4C, they've already switched back to their usual ident package, including the blob mascot, since the beginning of January. Seems like BBC One is taking a unique path this year. Maybe it's their way of slowly transitioning out of the festive season? **TellyFan1**: Interesting points! It does make the cold January days a bit more bearable to still see some festive remnants on TV. I just wonder when they plan to fully transition to their regular programming idents. It's a bit of a mixed message but a pleasant one nonetheless. **BroadcastBuddy**: There might be a broader strategy at play. Keeping the holiday idents running a bit longer could be a test to see how audiences respond to extended festive content, potentially influencing future decisions on seasonal branding duration. **ChannelChaser**: Agreed. Plus, it’s a clever way to keep conversations like ours going about their brand well into the new year. Seems like BBC One is playing the long game with viewer engagement this season. **WelshWatcher**: Could also be a practical aspect to it, perhaps aligning with a new campaign or programming launch they've got planned for later in January. Extending the holiday idents might just be a way to bridge the gap until they're ready to unveil what's next. **TellyFan1**: Those are all valid points. It’ll be interesting to see how this strategy plays out and what BBC One has up their sleeve for the rest of January. Hopefully, they'll surprise us with something exciting. Let’s keep our eyes peeled for any changes or announcements in the coming days!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where we learn the day it's to happen,","output":"**TellyFan1**: Guys, I got an update! Just saw an announcement that BBC One is planning to unveil their new branding and idents package on January 15th. Looks like the extended use of the holiday idents was indeed a bridge to something new. What does everyone think they have planned? **BroadcastBuddy**: Finally, some clarity! January 15th is an interesting choice, well after the usual New Year refreshes we’re used to. I’m curious if they’re going with a totally new theme or building upon elements from the holiday idents, considering how popular those were. **ChannelChaser**: That’s great news! I'm hoping for something innovative that shakes things up. BBC One has a history of strong visual storytelling with their idents. Maybe they’ll incorporate some tech-forward or interactive elements this time around? **WelshWatcher**: I wonder how this will compare to what S4C and the other channels are doing. S4C often aligns closely with BBC in terms of timing for new launches. Perhaps this could signal a wider refresh across several channels? **TellyFan1**: It’ll be interesting to see if this new package will set the tone for branding strategies across the board. Especially curious about whether the themes from the KikoRiki idents over Christmas will carry over or if it was just a festive one-off. **BroadcastBuddy**: With the date set, it gives us something to look forward to. I'm hoping the BBC will drop some teasers before the launch. It’d be great to get a sneak peek at the direction they’re heading in. **ChannelChaser**: Definitely keeping an eye out for any leaks or teaser promos. They’ve been pretty tight-lipped about it so far, but I bet there’s going to be at least a little something released to pique our interest before the big reveal. **WelshWatcher**: Absolutely, a teaser or two would do wonders to build anticipation. I’m also keen to see how this new branding will be reflected across their digital platforms. It’s always fascinating to watch a major channel undergo a significant transformation. **TellyFan1**: Mark your calendars for January 15th, everyone! It sounds like we’re in for a treat. Let’s reconvene once the new package is out. I’m excited to hear everyone’s thoughts and see how BBC One aims to innovate this time around."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up on that day, with Bikes as the first new ident at 6am, also we say the last ident at 3am beforehand","output":"**TellyFan1**: It’s the day, everyone! Woke up early just to catch the debut of BBC One's new idents package. The first one aired at 6AM and, you guessed it, it featured Bikes! It's a refreshing change. The whole sequence was dynamic, showcasing various people riding through beautifully lit, diverse landscapes. Really gives off a vibe of moving forward and connectivity. And for those who missed it, the last of the holiday idents aired at 3AM - a bit of a sentimental moment saying goodbye to the festive themes. **BroadcastBuddy**: Caught the Bikes ident this morning and was impressed by the cinematography! It’s a huge departure from the holiday idents but in a good way. It felt very contemporary, and the music was uplifting too. A promising start to the new package! **ChannelChaser**: I loved the Bikes ident! It was so vibrant and full of life, exactly what you want to kick start a new year. It symbolizes energy, diversity, and progression. If this is the direction BBC One is taking with their branding, count me in for the ride. **WelshWatcher**: The transition from the holiday idents to this new theme feels like a breath of fresh air. The Bikes ident had a sense of freedom and exploration to it. Also appreciated the inclusivity with the range of people and locations featured. It's exciting to think about what other themes will accompany Bikes in the lineup. **TellyFan1**: Agreed! It's a bold move to start with such an energetic and optimistic theme like Bikes. It sets a high bar for the rest of the ident series. I'm curious to see how each new ident will build upon this initial theme while bringing its own unique flair to the table. **BroadcastBuddy**: One thing’s for sure, BBC One is aiming to make a statement with these new idents. Moving away from the festive KikoRiki theme to something as universal yet engaging as Bikes shows they’re thinking about wide appeal and storytelling through simple, relatable moments. **ChannelChaser**: It’s fascinating to think about the thought process behind choosing Bikes as the launch ident. It’s universally relatable yet forward-looking. Very clever of BBC One to balance heritage with innovation. Can't wait to see the rest of the idents they've lined up. **WelshWatcher**: Absolutely. And considering this first glimpse, the production quality suggests we're in for some visually stunning presentations ahead. I hope they maintain this level of creativity and engagement with the audience throughout the entire series. **TellyFan1**: With the Bikes ident setting such a positive and energetic tone for 2023, I'm eager to see how BBC One will continue to surprise us.

They've been a staple of BBC One's identity for so long, and then, just like that, they were gone after Doctor Who on December 1st. **RetroWatcher**: Absolutely! You'd think for idents that have been around for over two decades, there would be some sort of farewell special or at least a nod to their legacy. It felt a bit abrupt just moving on without acknowledging the end of an era. **DanceLover**: I was really hoping for a final montage or something celebrating the many years we've had those idents. I mean, they've been such an iconic part of BBC One's visual signature. It's sad to see them go without much fanfare. **VisualNostalgic**: Exactly, some retrospective would have been great. Remember all the different themes they had through the years? A look back at their evolution would have been a fitting tribute. **BroadcastBuddy**: To be fair, perhaps BBC One wanted to focus more on the future and the excitement of bringing in something new? Still, I agree that recognizing the significance of what's being left behind is important for long-time viewers. **ChannelChaser**: That's a valid point. The transition to the new Bikes ident and the forthcoming series represents a fresh direction. But even a small acknowledgment during the transition period would have meant a lot to those of us who've grown attached to the dancers. **TellyFan1**: Maybe they thought the dancers had become so background to people that a big send-off wasn't necessary? But clearly, based on our conversation, there's a lot of love and nostalgia for them. **RetroWatcher**: It's a reminder of how quickly things change in the world of broadcasting. What's familiar one day can be history the next. Still, it would have been nice for BBC One to acknowledge the connection viewers had to the idents. **DanceLover**: Maybe we can hope for a retrospective feature online or as part of a documentary down the line? There's definitely enough interest and affection for the dancers to warrant a deeper dive into their history and impact. **VisualNostalgic**: Let's keep our fingers crossed for that. It would be a wonderful way to celebrate a visual element that, in its own unique way, was a significant part of British pop culture. **TellyFan1**: For now, though, we'll just have to cherish our memories of the dancers and look forward to creating new connections with the upcoming idents.

Did anyone else stay up to catch the final moments of the old BBC One idents last night? After the sleeping Rosa ident, there was an interesting transition. Instead of jumping straight to the usual test card, they used a unique placeholder until the new idents premiered at 6am. It was pretty minimalist but still caught my eye. **PixelPusher**: Yeah, I saw that! It was a classy touch. Rather than the standard color bars or test card, they opted for a simple, dark screen with the BBC One logo gently pulsing in the center. Felt like a moment of calm before the storm of the new branding. **VisualVibes**: I appreciated the subtlety of it—a quiet moment to say goodbye to the old and prepare for the new. Did anyone manage to capture a screenshot? It's one of those blink-and-you'll-miss-it kind of things that hold significance for us branding nerds. **BroadcastBuddy**: Managed to get a quick pic! It's not the best quality since it was so unexpected, but here's the link: [imaginarylink.jpg]. The pulsing effect created this anticipation, almost like the calm breathing before the day starts. Wonder if that was intentional, symbolizing the 'breath' before the new look. **LogoLover**: That's really cool, @BroadcastBuddy! Thanks for sharing. The choice of a pulsing logo definitely feels intentional. It evokes a sense of anticipation and heartbeat. A metaphor for the channel itself, staying alive and vibrant through changes. **RetroWatcher**: Noticed that too. It was a soft farewell to the old idents and a gentle lead-in to the new. I find these moments fascinating - how a simple placeholder or transition can convey so much about a channel's identity and its evolution. **DesignDiva**: It's moments like these that remind us of the power of visual identity in broadcasting. That placeholder, while minimal, was loaded with meaning. A quiet nod to the past and a soft yet promising beacon of change. Plus, it was a smart way to maintain viewer engagement during a typically 'dead' time. **NostalgiaNerd**: Absolutely, @DesignDiva. It’s these subtle touches that make brand transitions interesting. It wasn’t just a placeholder; it was a statement—like a palette cleanser before the main course. Made me even more excited for the 6am reveal. **IdentityInsider**: It's fascinating to think about the thought process that goes into even the smallest details of a brand's visual presentation. That placeholder was a bridge between eras for BBC One. Looking forward to seeing how this attention to detail plays out in the new idents and overall branding. **ScreenSavvy**: This discussion makes me appreciate the art behind broadcasting even more. Every element, even a temporary placeholder, contains a piece of the channel's story and its journey. Can't wait to dissect the new idents with you all.

I'm trying to determine if they introduced the new logo styling in that transitional moment. The latest version has a lowercase \\"one\\" placed next to the logo instead of the outgoing style with \\"One\\" in caps and located below the logo. Plus, the new lockup is reportedly in a red box. Did anyone notice this detail? **PixelPusher**: Good eye, @LogoLover! Yes, from what I observed during that placeholder moment, it seemed like they were using the new logo configuration. The “one” was indeed in lowercase and positioned next to the BBC logo. However, because of the minimalistic approach and the dark background, I didn't catch the red box. Maybe it was more subtle? **DesignDiva**: @PixelPusher, I think you're right. I also noticed the lowercase \\"one\\" but couldn't make out a red box. It was very minimalist, which might have meant the red box was either too subtle in that context or they opted not to use it during the placeholder screen to keep everything ultra-minimal. **BroadcastBuddy**: I'm glad you brought this up! I was specifically looking out for this change. The lowercase \\"one\\" was clearly part of the transition. As for the red box, if it was there, it was indeed very subtle. The focus was definitely on the logo's text change, subtly hinting at the new branding direction without giving too much away. **RetroWatcher**: This change represents a significant shift in branding strategy, doesn’t it? Moving from uppercase to lowercase suggests a more approachable, modern feel. Even without the red box being prominent in the placeholder, adjusting the logo’s text arrangement sets a new tone. **VisualVibes**: That's true, @RetroWatcher. This shift in logo design reflects a broader trend in branding towards accessibility and informality, which the lowercase \\"one\\" encapsulates perfectly. It's interesting that they chose this moment of transition to start introducing the new identity, even in such a subdued manner. **NostalgiaNerd**: Missed the transition myself, but loving this analysis. The evolution of a channel's logo, especially one as iconic as BBC One, is always fascinating. It's like witnessing history in real-time. The choice of lowercase and the positioning change seem to signify a move towards a more contemporary and casual branding philosophy. **IdentityInsider**: Exactly, @NostalgiaNerd. It's more than just a logo change; it's about repositioning the channel in the viewers' minds. The lowercase \\"one\\" next to the logo, even if the red box wasn't as noticeable, marks a departure from the traditional and signals a fresh, modern outlook. It’s subtle yet impactful. **ScreenSavvy**: Wow, didn't expect such a small detail to spark such an insightful discussion! Goes to show how integral branding is to a channel's identity and how even the smallest changes can reflect larger strategic shifts. Excited to see how this new logo plays out across all BBC One branding and communication. **LogoLover**: Thanks for weighing in, everyone! It’s these nuances that make the world of broadcast design so intriguing. Observing how a major network like BBC One navigates its visual identity evolution offers valuable lessons in branding and audience engagement. Can't wait to see the full rollout of the new look!

There's something incredibly calming about it, perfect for a news lead-in. It's quite a departure from the older, more vibrant setups. The minimalism really brings a new flavor to the channel. **SkyWatcher**: The Moon ident caught my eye. It's beautifully composed, with such a serene and peaceful vibe. Fits the \\"safe\\" news theme perfectly by being non-distracting yet aesthetically pleasing. This set feels like it's been curated with a lot of thought for different times and moods. **RotorFan**: Got to admit, the Helicopter one had me intrigued.

It's modern yet mysterious, and adds a dynamic angle to the news segment, literally. **BroadcastBuddy**: Absolutely, @RotorFan. Each ident seems to be crafted with a specific narrative in mind, even if it's meant to be subtle and subdued for the news. The Helicopter especially adds an element of urgency and coverage, fitting for a news intro, without being too overbearing. **LogoLover**: I've been impressed by the diversification in this new ident set.

Scenario Imagine you are the project manager of a software development team working on a new mobile application. You have decided to use CrewAI to help manage the project, assign tasks, and provide contextual information to team members. 2. Initial Setup You set up CrewAI with the necessary memory modules: Short-Term Memory, Long-Term Memory, and Entity Memory. You also configure the Contextual Memory module to interact with these memory modules. 3. Task Assignment One of the tasks in your project is to implement a new feature in the mobile application. You assign this task to a team member, Alice, using CrewAI. The task description is as follows: \`\`\` Task: Implement the new 'Share Location' feature in the mobile application. \`\`\` 4. Contextual Memory in Action When Alice receives the task, she wants to understand the context and any relevant information related to the task. She uses the Contextual Memory module to build the context for the task. a. \`build_context_for_task\`: Alice calls the \`build_context_for_task\` method with the task description and an empty context string. The method creates a query by combining the task description and the context string: \`\`\`python query = f\\"{task.description} {context}\\".strip() # query = \\"Implement the new 'Share Location' feature in the mobile application\\" \`\`\` b. \`_fetch_ltm_context\`: The method calls \`_fetch_ltm_context\` to retrieve historical data or insights from Long-Term Memory related to the task. The Long-Term Memory module searches for relevant information and returns the following results: \`\`\` Historical Data: - The 'Share Location' feature was discussed in the project kickoff meeting. - The feature should use the device's GPS to share the user's location with their contacts. \`\`\` c. \`_fetch_stm_context\`: The method then calls \`_fetch_stm_context\` to retrieve recent relevant insights from Short-Term Memory. The Short-Term Memory module searches for relevant information and returns the following results: \`\`\` Recent Insights: - The 'Share Location' feature should be implemented using the device's native location services. - The feature should include a privacy setting to allow users to control who can see their location. \`\`\` d. \`_fetch_entity_context\`: Finally, the method calls \`_fetch_entity_context\` to retrieve relevant entity information from Entity Memory. The Entity Memory module searches for relevant information and returns the following results: \`\`\` Entities: - The 'Share Location' feature is related to the 'User' entity, as it involves sharing the user's location. - The 'Share Location' feature is also related to the 'Contact' entity, as it involves sharing the user's location with their contacts. \`\`\` e. Formatting and Returning Context: The Contextual Memory module formats the retrieved context as a string and returns it to Alice: \`\`\` Historical Data: - The 'Share Location' feature was discussed in the project kickoff meeting. - The feature should use the device's GPS to share the user's location with their contacts. Recent Insights: - The 'Share Location' feature should be implemented using the device's native location services. - The feature should include a privacy setting to allow users to control who can see their location. Entities: - The 'Share Location' feature is related to the 'User' entity, as it involves sharing the user's location. - The 'Share Location' feature is also related to the 'Contact' entity, as it involves sharing the user's location with their contacts. \`\`\` 5.

Let's delve into the process focusing on architecture, modules, and integration strategies. # 1. Conceptual Overview The ATBmemoryAGI framework aims to enhance AI assistants by incorporating an intelligent memory management system. This system should enable AI assistants to learn, evolve, and improve autonomously based on past interactions with users. The core components of this framework would include: - **Short-Term Memory (STM):** Captures and retains recent interactions and insights. - **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** Stores historical data, insights, and user interactions over an extended period. - **Entity Memory (EM):** Contains structured information about entities relevant to the tasks and interactions. - **Contextual Memory Module:** Integrates insights from STM, LTM, and EM to provide context-relevant information for current tasks or inquiries. # 2. System Design and Architecture a. Memory Models - **STM and LTM:** Implement different storage strategies for STM and LTM, where STM is more volatile and LTM is persistent. Use databases or in-memory data structures for STM, and more durable storage solutions for LTM, like relational databases or document stores. - **EM:** Use a graph database or a structured database that allows for linking related entities and their attributes in a contextual manner. b. Contextual Memory Module - Design algorithms that can understand task descriptions, extract relevant keywords or entities, and query the STM, LTM, and EM for pertinent information. - Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for better interpretation of tasks and context extraction. - The module should be capable of synthesizing information from the three memory types into a coherent context for the AI assistant. # 3. Implementation a.

SQLite is a great choice for lightweight applications, prototypes, or when the simplicity of setup and minimal configuration outweigh the need for scaling to handle large, concurrent transactions typical of more complex database systems. Below, we break down the process of starting this project from scratch, considering SQLite's capabilities and limitations. # Stage 1: Setup and Initial Planning 1.1 Project Structure Create a basic directory structure for your project. For a Python-based project, it could look something like this: \`\`\` ATBmemoryAGI/ │ ├── db/ │ └── sqlite_db/ │ └── atbmemoryagi.db # SQLite database file │ ├── modules/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── stm.py # Short-Term Memory module │ ├── ltm.py # Long-Term Memory module │ ├── em.py # Entity Memory module │ └── cmm.py # Contextual Memory Module │ ├── utils/ │ └── db_utils.py # Utilities for interacting with the SQLite database │ └── main.py # Main application logic \`\`\` 1.2 Technology Stack - **Language:** Python 3.x. - **Database:** SQLite. - **NLP Libraries:** NLTK or SpaCy for processing and understanding tasks or queries. # Stage 2: Database and Memory Model Design SQLite simplifies the aspect of database management significantly by storing everything in a single file. For ATBmemoryAGI, you'll need to design tables that represent STM, LTM, and EM. 2.1 Database Schema - **STM (Short-Term Memory):** Data that's frequently updated or temporary. - Columns might include *ID, TaskID, Context, Timestamp*. - **LTM (Long-Term Memory):** Stores historical data and insights. - Columns might include *ID, DataEntry, Insights, CreatedAt*. - **EM (Entity Memory):** Manages structured information about entities. - Columns might include *EntityID, EntityType, Attributes, Relations*. 2.2 SQLite Setup Initialize your SQLite database and create these tables. You can use a script in the \`db/sqlite_db/\` directory for this. # Stage 3: Building Memory Modules 3.1 Developing Modules For each memory module (\`stm.py\`, \`ltm.py\`, \`em.py\`), develop Python classes or functions capable of performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their respective tables in the SQLite database. 3.2 Contextual Memory Module (\`cmm.py\`) This module integrates data from STM, LTM, and EM to provide contextually relevant information. It will involve querying each database table based on the task or query at hand and synthesizing the information into a useful format for the AI assistant. # Stage 4: Implementing Business Logic 4.1 Main Application (\`main.py\`) In \`main.py\`, create the application's logic that utilizes your memory modules. This might include initializing the memory system, processing tasks or queries, and providing interfaces to interact with the system, possibly via a command line or a simple web API. 4.2 NLP Integration Utilize NLP libraries to process and understand the context of tasks or queries. This involves parsing text, extracting relevant entities or keywords, and using this processed information to fetch relevant data from your memory modules. # Stage 5: Testing and Iteration With the core components in place, it's crucial to test each part extensively. - **Unit Testing:** Write tests for each function in your memory modules to ensure correctness. - **Integration Testing:** Test the system as a whole to ensure it works seamlessly, particularly focusing on the interaction between modules and the main application logic. # Stage 6: Refinement and Feedback Loop After initial testing, seek feedback on the system's performance and usability. Use this feedback to refine and improve your application, focusing on areas like enhancing NLP processing, optimizing database queries, and improving the system's UI/UX if applicable. # Conclusion Building the ATBmemoryAGI framework from scratch with SQLite involves careful planning, a clear understanding of the requirements, and iteratively developing and testing to create a robust application.

Since the request now incorporates using LangChain, I'll adapt the approach to fit within a more general language AI model application, albeit LangChain specifically as requested hasn't been detailed in previous shared context. We'll create a simplified version focused on language model integration that aligns with the typical tasks LangChain aims to facilitate, keeping in mind the components: Short-Term Memory (STM), Long-Term Memory (LTM), Entity Memory (EM), and the Contextual Memory Module (CMM). Given this is a text-based overview, I'll describe the process of creating files and the basic code structure within them. You'll need to implement or adjust the actual logic based on more specific requirements, model choices, or performance optimizations. # 1. Setting up the Project Environment First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies efficiently. \`\`\`bash python3 -m venv atbmemoryagi-env source atbmemoryagi-env/bin/activate # On Windows, use \`atbmemoryagi-envScriptsactivate\` \`\`\` Install necessary packages: \`\`\`bash pip install sqlite3 nltk spacy \`\`\` # 2.

Memory Modules Implementation Each Python file within the \`modules/\` directory represents a separate module responsible for handling different segments of memory. Due to space constraints, I'll outline the structure for these modules rather than providing complete scripts. Example Structure for \`stm.py\` \`\`\`python import sqlite3 class STM: def __init__(self, db_path=\\"ATBmemoryAGI/db/atbmemoryagi.db\\"): self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path) def add_memory(self, task_id, context): sql = ''' INSERT INTO stm(task_id,context) VALUES(?,?)

Integrating Contextual Memory Module (CMM) The CMM (\`modules/cmm.py\`) would incorporate logic to interact across STM, LTM, and EM, fetch relevant data, and use NLP (SpaCy or NLTK) to provide contextually enriched information. Since building out a complete, detailed implementation of the CMM, including sophisticated NLP processing and integration with a language AI model (such as LangChain, assuming it's an AI framework or toolkit for chain-of-thought processing with language models), would require a comprehensive understanding of specific use cases and functional requirements, this outline aims to establish a foundation upon which these components can be elaborated. # 6. Main Application Logic (\`main.py\`) In \`main.py\`, you'd import these modules and implement the business logic to parse inputs (e.g., task descriptions), utilize the CMM for context building, and interact with users or other systems. # Final Note This guide outlines the initial steps and provides the skeleton code necessary to start building the ATBmemoryAGI project with an SQLite backend and Python.

As of my last update in September 2023, the technology getting a lot of attention for boosting frame rates in games and other applications is known as NVIDIA's DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), AMD's FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), or similar AI-based or upscaling technologies. These systems work fundamentally by rendering a game at a lower resolution and then using AI or other upscaling techniques to enhance the image to a higher resolution, effectively boosting frame rates because the game is technically being rendered with fewer pixels. The amount by which these technologies can boost FPS (frames per second) varies greatly depending on several factors: 1. **Hardware**: The specific GPU and CPU you have can affect performance gains, as more powerful hardware generally sees better results. 2. **Settings**: The settings you choose for these technologies (e.g., Quality, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance in the case of DLSS) impact both the visual fidelity and the FPS gain. Choosing a performance-oriented setting usually yields a higher FPS boost at the cost of some image quality. 3. **Game Implementation**: How a game implements DLSS, FSR, or any similar technology can also influence the effectiveness of the FPS boost. Some games might see a dramatic increase in FPS, while others might have modest improvements. 4. **Resolution**: Generally, these technologies tend to provide more significant FPS improvements at higher resolutions (e.g., 4K). At lower resolutions, the performance gains might not be as pronounced because the GPU isn't as heavily taxed, to begin with. As a rough estimate, using such technologies can result in FPS boosts from 20% to over 100% in some cases, depending on the factors mentioned above. However, without a specific technology or context in mind, it's challenging to provide precise figures. Always refer to the latest reviews and benchmarks for the technology and games you're interested in to get a clear idea of the potential FPS benefits."},{"instruction":"for exmaple i7 13620h and 4060 how much fps would incase with frame gen on","output":"As of the last update in 2023, providing an exact FPS increase value for a specific hardware configuration using a frame generation or upscaling technology like NVIDIA's DLSS (which might be what you're referring to with \\"Frame Gen\\") requires specific details about the game or application, settings, and resolution you are considering. However, I can provide a generalized explanation and what factors would influence the FPS increase. # Hardware Specified - **Intel i7-13620H**: A high-performance, mobile CPU primarily found in laptops, suitable for gaming and professional workloads. - **NVIDIA RTX 4060**: Assuming you're referring to a laptop variant given the CPU context, it's a mid-range GPU in NVIDIA's lineup, supporting features like Ray Tracing and DLSS. # Factors Influencing FPS Increase: 1. **Game Optimization**: Not all games will benefit equally from technologies like DLSS. Games that are heavily optimized for certain hardware or technologies can see significant FPS improvements. 2. **Resolution**: Higher resolutions like 1440p or 4k see more substantial performance improvements with DLSS because the GPU is the primary bottleneck. If you're gaming at 1080p, the FPS increase might still be noticeable but not as substantial because the lower resolution might not tax the GPU as much. 3. **DLSS Setting**: NVIDIA's DLSS offers different settings, from Quality to Ultra Performance. The higher the performance mode (leaning towards Ultra Performance), the greater the FPS increase, but this might come at a cost to image quality. 4. **Game Settings**: Higher game graphics settings will generally result in a more significant FPS increase when enabling DLSS because it helps alleviate the GPU workload by rendering frames at a lower internal resolution before upscaling. # Estimated Increase: Given the specified hardware and assuming you are playing a modern, demanding game at 1440p or 4K resolution with DLSS on, it's plausible to see anywhere from a 20% to over 100% increase in FPS, depending on the DLSS mode used and the baseline performance. For instance, if you were initially getting 40 FPS at 4K Ultra settings without DLSS, enabling DLSS could potentially push your FPS well above 60, making the game more playable at higher settings. However, note that these are estimative figures. The actual performance gain can vary widely based on the game, the selected DLSS mode, and other system configurations. For precise numbers, looking up benchmarks for similar hardware configurations in the specific games you're interested in would provide more accurate guidance."},{"instruction":"i am talking about pure frame gen on without using DLSS upscaling","output":"As of my last update in 2023, if you're referring to \\"pure frame generation\\" independent of upscaling techniques like NVIDIA's DLSS, you might be talking about a concept that is more theoretical or emerging in nature, and not widely implemented or recognized by that specific term in consumer graphics technology. Unlike DLSS which uses AI to upscale and improve frame rates while maintaining image quality, frame generation without upscaling would imply creating new frames between existing ones to increase smoothness or perceived fluidity, potentially without changing the game's resolution or the underlying image quality directly. There isn't a widely adopted, mainstream technology labeled specifically as \\"pure frame generation\\" outside of methods like motion interpolation seen in some high refresh-rate monitors and televisions, which can create intermediate frames to make motion appear smoother. This is different from increasing game FPS through rendering techniques or hardware acceleration. In the context of gaming PCs and current technologies like those provided by NVIDIA or AMD, the primary methodologies for improving frame rates or game smoothness involve: - **Upscaling Techniques**: Like NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR, which increase frame rates by rendering games at a lower resolution and upscaling them. - **Variable Rate Shading (VRS)**: Improves performance by varying the shading rate for different areas of the frame, focusing processing power where it's most needed. - **Direct Storage**: Reduces load times and can indirectly affect game smoothness by optimizing data streaming to the GPU. For theoretical \\"frame generation\\" without upscaling, in the sense of creating additional frames in real-time to improve fluidity without altering resolution (and without reference to a specific existing technology like DLSS), it is difficult to quantify how much FPS would increase because there's no direct consumer technology that does solely this without also altering image quality or resolution in some manner. If future technologies evolve that can genuinely generate frames in a way described, the impact would largely depend on the efficiency of the algorithm, how it’s implemented in hardware/software, the complexity of the game scenes, and the capabilities of the GPU and CPU. It might offer smoother gameplay and higher perceived frame rates, especially in scenarios where traditional rendering might struggle to maintain high FPS. However, as of the last update, such a technology would be speculative. Always keep an eye on the latest announcements from major GPU manufacturers and software developers for the latest in game performance enhancement technologies."},{"instruction":"Story prompt: On April of 2024, as leaks for the newest chapter of the hit manga series, Jujutsu Kaisen, were uploaded, translations revealed what many fans had speculated since the beginning of the series, just not in the way anyone really expected.

My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious.

Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. Write a news article set in this scenario about the amount of empty shops on Sauchiehall Street, branding it \\"a absolute joke\\" Other closed shops besides Riki include Greaves (closed in 2017), BHS (closed in 2016), the abandoned O2 ABC, etc","output":"**Title: \\"Sauchiehall Street's Retail Crisis: A Legacy of Neglect\\"** Date: November 5, 2023 Location: Glasgow, Scotland In the bustling heart of Glasgow, Sauchiehall Street once stood as a vibrant hub of commerce and community, a place where both locals and tourists would swarm to indulge in retail therapy, savour culinary delights, and bask in the unique cultural experiences the area had to offer. Today, however, the street paints a very different picture—a stark emblem of retail decline and urban neglect, festooned with the all-too-familiar sight of shuttered storefronts and abandoned premises. Among the notable casualties of this retail downturn is the beloved Riki store, a cherished destination for children and families that shut its doors back in 2007. Its closure, emblematic of a much broader issue, served as a harbinger for a troubling trend that would see key retail players like Greaves and BHS also succumb to the pressures of a rapidly changing shopping landscape. Greaves Sports, a longstanding Glasgow institution since 1930, bid its farewell in 2017, unable to compete with online giants and changing consumer behaviours. The British Home Stores (BHS), another pillar of the British high street, closed nationwide in 2016, leaving its Sauchiehall Street location desolate and adding to the growing list of retail voids in the area. The O2 ABC Glasgow, a historic music venue that was a cornerstone for entertainment in the city, now stands silent and unused following a catastrophic fire in June 2018 that also affected the iconic Glasgow School of Art. The venue's closure not only represents a significant cultural loss but further exacerbates the feeling of abandonment that now characterises much of Sauchiehall Street. Critics and local business owners brand the increasing number of empty shops as \\"an absolute joke,\\" pointing fingers at both the economic strategies purported by the local government and the landlords' unrealistic rent expectations. \\"It's a travesty,\\" remarks Fiona McDougall, a lifelong resident and former retail worker on Sauchiehall Street. \\"This street used to be the lifeblood of Glasgow. Now it’s become a ghost town. Where there was once laughter and light, there’s now silence and shadow.\\" Efforts to rejuvenate the area have been met with mixed responses, with skepticism from locals who fear a focus on short-term, less sustainable businesses rather than addressing the root causes of retail decline and the challenges faced by traditional brick-and-mortar stores. \\"What Sauchiehall Street needs is a concerted effort to bring back businesses that resonate with people's actual needs,\\" suggests local entrepreneur Derek Allan. \\"We need a blend of retail, entertainment, and community spaces that can adapt with the times.\\" The decline of Sauchiehall Street is not unique, reflecting broader national and global trends in retail and public spaces' transformation. However, its impact is felt deeply by the Glasgow community, which mourns not just the loss of individual stores but the gradual erosion of a vibrant public realm that once stood at the core of the city's identity. As shops continue to close and the future of Sauchiehall Street hangs in the balance, questions loom large over what measures can be taken to stem the tide of decline. It will require innovative thinking, substantial investment, and perhaps most crucially, a reimagining of what a high street can and should offer in the 21st century. Only time will tell if Sauchiehall Street can reclaim its place as a bustling, dynamic epicenter of Glasgow's rich urban tapestry."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up in March saying there's only one image that represents the street in its current state, also on an added note M&S closed in 2022","output":"**Title: \\"Sauchiehall Street: A Single Image Captures the Essence of Decline\\"** Date: March 15, 2024 Location: Glasgow, Scotland In a poignant reflection of the times, Sauchiehall Street, once the throbbing heart of Glasgow's retail and entertainment district, continues its seemingly inexorable slide into obscurity and dilapidation. A single image has begun circulating on social media platforms and local news outlets, emblematic of the street's current plight. This photogenic representation captures the eerie silence and haunting absence that now defines a street which was once bustling with life and energy. The photograph, taken by local enthusiast and amateur photographer Ian McLean, depicts a stretch of Sauchiehall Street bathed in the cold light of a March morning. Shadowed storefronts stand in silence, their shutters permanently down, while litter dances in the gentle breeze, unimpeded by the foot traffic of days gone by. This single frame contains within it stories of numerous closures that have plagued the street, including the iconic Marks & Spencer, which shut its doors in 2022, marking another significant blow to the area's retail appeal. The loss of Marks & Spencer was more than the end of a store; it was a symbol of Sauchiehall Street's fading relevance in modern retail, leaving a void that has yet to be filled. The British retail giant had been a fixture on the street for decades, providing local residents and visitors alike with a wide range of goods and contributing significantly to the area's footfall. Its closure has been felt deeply, leaving many to question the future viability of high-street retail in Glasgow's changing landscape. The single image that has come to represent Sauchiehall Street's decline is more than just a snapshot of urban decay; it's a call to action for city planners, local businesses, and the community. Discussions have been reignited on social media and city council meetings, focusing on what measures can be employed to breathe life back into this historic street. From pop-up shops and community events to more significant infrastructure projects and financial incentives for new businesses, ideas abound, but consensus on the way forward remains elusive. \\"The photograph I took was meant to highlight the beauty in decay, but it's also a stark reminder that action is needed,\\" says McLean. \\"We can't let Sauchiehall Street fade into history. It has too much to offer, and with a collective will, there's hope for revitalization.\\" As Glasgow looks toward the future, the emblematic image of Sauchiehall Street serves as both a warning and an opportunity. There's a growing realization that for the street to return to its former glory, a reimagining of its role in the city's social and economic fabric is necessary. With thoughtful urban planning and a commitment to fostering community-centric initiatives, there is potential for Sauchiehall Street to transform once again, this time into an area that reflects the needs and aspirations of a contemporary Glasgow."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where the sad image, that we have been forced to see walking past every day since 2007, begins trending, also representing the \\"disgraceful decline of this once great street reduced to an absolute joke\\"","output":"**Title: \\"The Viral Despair: Sauchiehall Street's Decline Captured in a Singular Image\\"** Date: May 10, 2024 Location: Glasgow, Scotland In recent weeks, an image emblematic of Sauchiehall Street's stark decline has caught the digital wind, trending across social media platforms and stirring a fervent dialogue among Glaswegians and beyond. The photograph, a somber representation of the once-thriving street's current state of desolation, has become a powerful symbol of urban neglect and the community's collective heartache. This image, familiar to the locals who have passed it every day since 2007, encapsulates the \\"disgraceful decline of this once-great street reduced to an absolute joke,\\" in the words of an impassioned city council commentator during a heated debate. It showcases a stretch of Sauchiehall Street devoid of its former vibrancy, littered with the husks of businesses that once served as the lifeblood of Glasgow's bustling retail artery. The viral spread of this poignant photograph has ignited a firestorm of public opinion and outcry, bringing to light the deep-seated frustrations of a community feeling abandoned by the powers that be. Social media users have tagged city officials, demanding answers and action, while hashtags like #SaveSauchiehallStreet and #GlasgowDeservesBetter have proliferated, mobilizing a movement of citizens advocating for rejuvenation and change. The image has transcended its initial purpose as a stark reminder of decline, evolving into a rallying cry for revitalization efforts. \\"It's more than just a photograph; it's a wake-up call,\\" remarked Fiona Robertson, a local business owner who has witnessed the street's transformation first-hand. \\"Sauchiehall Street has a rich history and a lot of potentials. This image should not be where the story ends.\\" Amidst the groundswell of attention, city council members have been put under increasing pressure to address the critical state of Sauchiehall Street and to develop a robust plan for its recovery. Proposals ranging from financial incentives for small businesses, infrastructural improvements, art and cultural initiatives, and community-led development projects have been tabled in earnest discussions aimed at reclaiming the legacy of Sauchiehall Street. The viral photograph has also prompted a series of town hall meetings, inviting community input on the future of Sauchiehall Street. These gatherings have seen an impassioned turnout, with citizens bringing forth innovative ideas and a willingness to collaborate with local authorities to initiate a turnaround. As the image continues to evoke strong reactions and drive conversation both online and offline, there's a growing sense that the tide may finally be turning. With the combined forces of community engagement, political will, and innovative thinking, there's hope yet for Sauchiehall Street to rise from the ashes of neglect and regain its status as a vibrant hub of Glasgow's social and economic life.

As for BlueHare, his campaign continues, with each crying Krash serving as a reminder of what's at stake. \\"Art has the power to move people, to make them stop and think,\\" he concludes. \\"If my paintings can inspire even a handful of people to stand up for our community, to invest in it and believe in it once more, then it's all been worth it.\\" In a time of silence and decline, the crying Krash has become a voice for Glasgow’s streets, echoing the community's longing for revival and hope amidst adversity."},{"instruction":"Write a convo in 2032 about the state of Riki then, and if the characters are still appearing in city","output":"**Forum Title: Glasgow City Vibes** **Thread Title: The Legacy of Riki and Its Characters: A Look Back and Ahead in 2032** --- **User1: GlasgowNostalgic** Hey everyone, been a while since we delved into this, but does anyone remember the Riki store and all those characters that became a symbol of Sauchiehall Street’s better days? It’s 2032 now, do you think the characters like Krash have any presence in the city still? --- **User2: FutureGlasgowKid** Absolutely remember! My parents used to tell me stories about shopping at Riki and how Krash was everywhere - on bags, posters, even painted on vacant storefronts as a symbol of protest. Surprisingly, I saw a street performer dressed as Krash just last weekend near Buchanan Street. Some traditions never die, it seems! --- **User3: UrbanRevive313** Krash and the gang indeed have a legacy that's hard to shake. There’s a bit of a cult following now, with some indie game developers releasing a retro game featuring Riki characters. Plus, there’s the annual cosplay event that sees a rally of characters. The spirit of Riki lives on in these small yet meaningful ways. --- **User4: HistoryHawk** Fascinating to see how characters from a closed-down shop have maintained cultural relevance after all these years. I’m working on a documentary project about Glasgow's cultural icons through the decades, and the Riki characters, especially Krash, serve as a poignant chapter in the city's history of resilience and communal memory. --- **User5: StreetArtSoul** The crying Krash became an unofficial emblem of the decline of Glasgow's retail heart. Now, you see murals and graffiti art inspired by that imagery – it's evolved but still carries the sentiment of nostalgia and loss. Artists around the city have been instrumental in keeping the memory and the message alive. --- **User6: CityFuturePlanner** From a city planning perspective, the story of Riki and its characters highlights the deep connection people have to communal spaces and local culture. It underlines the importance of sustainable development that respects and incorporates these emotional landmarks. There’s talk of integrating more cultural heritage installations in future urban development projects, potentially including tributes to Riki and its universe. --- **User7: RetroRewind** I run a retro memorabilia shop, and you’d be surprised at how popular Riki merchandise still is. We’ve got posters, figures, and even old shopping bags from the store itself. People come in not just for nostalgia but to share stories of Riki with younger generations. It's become a piece of Glasgow’s history that transcends time. --- **User8: CultureVulture101** It’s testament to Glasgow’s spirit that the characters of a children's store have not only remained in memory but continue to inspire and show up around the city. Whether it’s through art, gaming, or street performances, Riki’s world has proved to be enduring. Here’s hoping the city finds a way to officially commemorate this unique part of our history soon. --- **Moderator: GlasgowPulse** Great discussion, folks! It's clear Riki and its characters like Krash mean a lot to Glasgow and its people, both as a cherished memory and a living symbol of the city's culture. Let’s keep sharing our stories and maybe even organize a community event to celebrate Riki’s legacy. Stay tuned for more details, and let’s keep the spirit alive!"},{"instruction":"Who currently runs the BBC Sunday Morning politics show","output":"As of my last update in 2023, Sophie Raworth is the presenter of the BBC's Sunday morning politics show, which was previously known as \\"The Andrew Marr Show.\\" The program was rebranded as \\"Sunday Morning\\" with Sophie Raworth taking over as the lead presenter after Andrew Marr left the BBC to join Global and the LBC.

Known for his incisive and respectful interviewing style, Marr's recent broadcasts have seen him cutting off guests mid-sentence, prompting mixed reactions from viewers and politicians alike. During the latest episode of \\"The Andrew Marr Show\\" on BBC One, viewers were surprised to see the veteran journalist frequently interjecting as his guests, including senior politicians and subject matter experts, attempted to answer his questions. The move seems to mark a departure from Marr's usual method of allowing guests ample time to articulate their thoughts, leading to speculation about the reasons behind this change in strategy. One episode particularly highlighted this shift when Marr interrupted the Minister of Health three times in less than two minutes, pressing for more direct answers to his questions on the government's handling of healthcare funding. The change has sparked a debate on social media, with some viewers applauding Marr for his efforts to elicit straightforward responses while others criticize the approach for seeming overly confrontational. In response to the feedback, the BBC released a statement: \\"Andrew Marr and 'The Andrew Marr Show' are committed to delivering high-quality journalism and holding power to account. Our approach to interviews is always evolving to ensure our audience gets the clarity and answers it deserves.\\" Marr, with a distinguished career spanning several decades, has interviewed countless political figures, authors, and international personalities, earning a reputation for his thorough preparation and ability to dissect complex issues. However, this new tactic has left some wondering whether the pressure to secure headline-making responses in an increasingly competitive media landscape is influencing Marr's interviewing style. Political analyst Dr. Helen Fisher commented, \\"While there's a clear need for journalists to challenge their guests and dig beneath the surface, there's also a fine line between pushing for truth and undermining the quality of discourse. Marr's recent style might just reflect a broader trend in political interviewing, but it'll be interesting to see how it evolves and is received in the longer term.\\" As \\"The Andrew Marr Show\\" continues to navigate the balance between informative dialogue and engaging content, the audience's reception to this change will likely influence how political interviews are conducted in the future, not only by Marr but across the broadcasting landscape. For now, viewers can anticipate more spirited exchanges on the show, as Marr adapts his legendary interview technique to meet the demands of today's fast-paced and often polarized political climate."},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT - MID-SUMMER} Natsuki: “Willow, what the heck is burning?

However, the laptop cant access the internet. I know the dekstop side is fine. What do ai need to do on the lp","output":"To connect your Fedora laptop to the internet through a Debian desktop via an Ethernet cable, and assuming the desktop side is correctly configured to share its internet connection, you need to perform a few steps on your Fedora laptop to ensure it is set up properly to receive and utilize the shared internet connection. Here's a general guide to help you troubleshoot and set up the connection on your Fedora laptop: # 1. Check Cable and Hardware Connections - Ensure the Ethernet cable is properly connected to both the Fedora laptop and the Debian desktop. - Check if the Ethernet port lights are blinking on both machines, indicating a physical connection. # 2. Ensure Network Manager Service is Running 1. Open a terminal. 2. Run \`sudo systemctl status NetworkManager\` to check if Network Manager is active. If it's not, start it with \`sudo systemctl start NetworkManager\` and enable it to run at boot with \`sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager\`. # 3. Configure Network Settings on Fedora Assuming the Debian desktop is properly sharing its internet connection (probably configured with a static IP and DHCP to distribute IP addresses), your Fedora laptop needs to be set to obtain an IP address automatically from the Debian desktop. Here’s how to check or modify this setting: From the Command Line: 1. **Find the Ethernet Interface Name:** Run \`ip link\` to list all network interfaces. Look for your Ethernet interface, which typically starts with \`en\` (e.g., enp3s0). 2. **Check Current IP Configuration for the Interface:** Use \`ip addr show <interface_name>\` to check if your Ethernet interface has an IP address assigned by the Debian desktop's DHCP server. 3. **Set to Obtain IP Automatically (DHCP):** - If your system uses \`NetworkManager\`, you can manage connections via \`nmcli\` or \`nmtui\`. - \`nmtui\`: Open a text user interface for network settings where you can Edit a connection and set it to \\"Automatically connect\\". - \`nmcli\`: Use to modify or create a connection. For example, \`nmcli con mod <connection_name> ipv4.method auto\` and then \`nmcli con up <connection_name>\` to apply changes. From the GUI: 1. Click on the network icon on your panel/taskbar and open Network Settings. 2. Go to the \\"Wired\\" section (or similar depending on your environment) and find your connection. 3. Edit the connection to ensure it's set to \\"Automatic (DHCP)\\" for IPv4 settings. 4. Save the changes and, if necessary, disconnect and reconnect the Ethernet cable to trigger a new DHCP request. # 4. Check for Internet Connectivity After applying the settings, try to access the internet. You can do this by: - Opening a web browser and trying to navigate to a website. - Running \`ping -c 4 8.8.8.8\` in a terminal to see if you can reach Google's DNS servers. - Running \`ping -c 4 google.com\` to check DNS resolution. If you still cannot access the internet, investigate further by reviewing the firewall rules on both Fedora and Debian systems to ensure they're not blocking traffic. On Fedora, use \`firewall-cmd --list-all\` to view the current FirewallD settings. Adjust as necessary, keeping security in mind. The above steps should guide you through setting up your Fedora laptop to access the internet shared from a Debian desktop. If you encounter specific errors during the process, those errors will be key to diagnosing and fixing any remaining issues."},{"instruction":"How do I format a disk in fedora temrian to exfat?","output":"Formatting a disk to the exFAT filesystem in Fedora can be achieved from the terminal using the \`mkfs.exfat\` command. However, before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary tools installed and that you're carefully targeting the correct disk to avoid data loss. Here’s how to do it: # Step 1: Install exFAT Utilities Fedora includes support for exFAT filesystems, but you might need to install the utilities if they're not already on your system. Open a terminal and install the exFAT utilities by running: \`\`\`bash sudo dnf install exfat-utils \`\`\` # Step 2: Identify Your Disk Before formatting, you need to identify the disk you want to format. Be very careful during this step to ensure you select the correct device, as formatting will erase all data on the disk. Run the following command to list all connected storage devices: \`\`\`bash lsblk \`\`\` or \`\`\`bash sudo fdisk -l \`\`\` You'll see a list of devices, like \`/dev/sda\`, \`/dev/sdb\`, etc. Identify the disk you want to format based on its size and/or mount point. For example, if your disk is \`/dev/sdb\`, that's the device identifier you'll use in the next step. Again, be absolutely sure you have the correct device as the next steps will erase all data on it. # Step 3: Unmount the Disk (if mounted) If the disk is mounted, you'll need to unmount it before formatting. Replace \`/dev/sdb\` with your actual disk identifier: \`\`\`bash sudo umount /dev/sdb* \`\`\` # Step 4: Format the Disk to exFAT Now, use the \`mkfs.exfat\` command to format the disk to exFAT. Add a label if you wish by using \`-n label\`, replacing \`label\` with your desired volume label. \`\`\`bash sudo mkfs.exfat -n label /dev/sdb \`\`\` Replace \`/dev/sdb\` with your actual disk identifier and \`label\` with your desired volume label (or omit \`-n label\` if you don't want to set one). # Step 5: Verify the Disk is Formatted You can verify that your disk is formatted to exFAT by listing the filesystem details: \`\`\`bash lsblk -f \`\`\` Look for your disk in the list. The \`FSTYPE\` column should now show \`exfat\`. # Notes and Warnings - **Data Loss Warning:** Formatting a disk will erase all data on it. Make sure you have backups of any data you wish to keep before proceeding. - **Correct Disk:** Double-check the disk identifier (\`/dev/sdx\`) to ensure you're formatting the correct disk to avoid undesired data loss. - **Mounting:** After formatting, you can mount the disk manually or it will be mounted automatically the next time you insert it (if GUI auto-mounting is enabled). This guide assumes you're using a standard Fedora installation with \`sudo\` privileges. Adjustments may be necessary for custom setups or different Fedora versions."},{"instruction":"How do I mount it in terminal?","output":"To mount an exFAT filesystem (or any other filesystem type) in the terminal on a Fedora system, you will first need to ensure you have the appropriate file system utilities installed (for exFAT, this was covered in a previous instruction with \`exfat-utils\`). Once you've formatted your disk to exFAT, mounting it is straightforward. Follow these steps: # Step 1: Create a Mount Point Firstly, you need to create a directory that will serve as the mount point for your filesystem. This can be anywhere you like but commonly, external drives are mounted under \`/mnt\` or \`/media\`. For example, to create a mount point under \`/mnt\`: \`\`\`bash sudo mkdir /mnt/myexfatdrive \`\`\` Replace \`myexfatdrive\` with a name that is meaningful to you. This directory is where you'll access the files on your disk once it's mounted. # Step 2: Mount the Filesystem With the mount point created, you can now mount the exFAT filesystem. Ensure you replace \`/dev/sdb1\` with the appropriate device identifier for your partition and \`/mnt/myexfatdrive\` with the mount point you created. \`\`\`bash sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt/myexfatdrive \`\`\` Here, \`-t exfat\` specifies that the filesystem type is exFAT. Most of the time, this option is optional because the system can auto-detect the filesystem type, but it’s good practice to specify it when you know the filesystem type to avoid any issues. # Step 3: Verify the Mount To ensure that the disk has been mounted successfully, use the \`mount\` or \`df\` command: \`\`\`bash df -h \`\`\` or \`\`\`bash lsblk \`\`\` Look for your device in the output or check that the mount point \`/mnt/myexfatdrive\` displays with the associated device. You can now access the files on the drive through the directory \`/mnt/myexfatdrive\`. # Step 4: Auto-Mount at Boot (Optional) If you want this drive to be mounted automatically at each system startup, you would need to add an entry to the \`/etc/fstab\` file. Be cautious with this step, as incorrect entries can cause boot issues. 1. Open \`/etc/fstab\` in a text editor with root privileges, for example: \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/fstab \`\`\` 2. Add a line at the end of the file for your drive: \`\`\`plaintext /dev/sdb1 /mnt/myexfatdrive exfat defaults 0 0 \`\`\` Replace \`/dev/sdb1\` with your device and \`/mnt/myexfatdrive\` with your mount point. Save the file and exit the editor. 3. To ensure there are no errors with your fstab file, which can prevent your system from booting correctly, you can simulate the mount with: \`\`\`bash sudo mount -a \`\`\` This command will attempt to mount all filesystems specified in \`fstab\`. If you encounter any errors, revisit your \`fstab\` entry to correct them before restarting your computer. 4. *Note*: Using UUIDs in the \`fstab\` file instead of device names (e.g., \`/dev/sdb1\`) is a more stable option, as device names can change. You can find the UUID of your partition with the \`blkid\` command: \`\`\`bash sudo blkid \`\`\` And then use it in \`fstab\` like so: \`\`\`plaintext UUID=your-uuid-here /mnt/myexfatdrive exfat defaults 0 0 \`\`\` # Conclusion You've now mounted an exFAT filesystem on Fedora. Remember to replace \`/dev/sdb1\` with your specific device identifier and \`/mnt/myexfatdrive\` with your chosen mount point throughout the instructions.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/20 08:35:40

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/20 08:41:35

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

How can I help you today?"},{"instruction":"Cutoff date ?","output":"My last update was in September 2023, so that's my current knowledge cutoff date. How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Want to implement the model in completion","output":"If you're looking to implement a model like GPT-4 for generating text completions, your approach will depend on whether you're using an API provided by a service like OpenAI or setting up a model yourself. Here's a basic outline for both scenarios: # Using an API (such as OpenAI's API for GPT-4) 1. **API Key**: First, obtain access to the API by signing up and getting an API key from the service provider (e.g., OpenAI for GPT models). 2. **Choose Language and Libraries**: Decide on a programming language and any necessary libraries. For interacting with APIs, languages like Python are commonly used, along with libraries like \`requests\` for making HTTP requests. 3. **API Request**: Write a code script that uses your API key to authenticate and sends a prompt to the GPT-4 API endpoint. You'll have to format your request according to the API documentation, specifying parameters such as the prompt, temperature, max tokens, etc. 4. **Handle the Response**: Process the API's response to your request. This typically involves parsing the JSON output to extract the completion text. 5. **Use the Output**: Implement logic in your code to use the generated text for your application's needs. # Setting Up the Model Yourself (More Theoretical for Models Like GPT-4 Due to Resource Constraints) 1. **Model and Weights**: You would need access to the model architecture and pre-trained weights. For large models like GPT-4, this is impractical for individuals due to the computational resources required. 2. **Runtime Environment**: If you were to work with smaller models or a segment of GPT-4 provided for academic purposes, you'd need an appropriate runtime environment, such as a machine with sufficient CPU/GPU resources. 3. **Load the Model**: Using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, you would write code to load the model and pre-trained weights into your environment. 4. **Generate Completions**: You would write additional code to preprocess input prompts into a format the model expects, feed them to the model, and process the output to generate readable text. Since the full implementation of GPT-4 is out of reach for individual developers due to its size and the computational cost, most people opt to use the API provided by OpenAI. Here's a simple Python example using the \`requests\` library to make an API call to OpenAI's GPT: \`\`\`python import requests def generate_completion(prompt, api_key): url = \\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\\" headers = {\\"Authorization\\": f\\"Bearer {api_key}\\"} json = { \\"model\\": \\"text-davinci-003\\", # Or another model version \\"prompt\\": prompt, \\"temperature\\": 0.7, \\"max_tokens\\": 100 } response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json) result = response.json() return result.get(\\"choices\\")[0].get(\\"text\\", \\"\\") # Example usage api_key = \\"your_api_key_here\\" prompt = \\"Write a short story about a talking cat.\\" completion = generate_completion(prompt, api_key) print(completion) \`\`\` Replace \`\\"your_api_key_here\\"\` with your actual API key from OpenAI. Note that the model identifier (\`\\"text-davinci-003\\"\`) should be replaced with the correct model you wish to use, e.g., an identifier for GPT-4 once it's available in the API. This basic outline should give you a start, but be sure to customize your approach based on your specific project needs and the latest documentation and resources provided by the API service."},{"instruction":"Change the model to gpt 4","output":"Certainly! If you're aiming to specifically use GPT-4 with OpenAI's API and assuming GPT-4 is available in their service, you would modify the model identifier in the example provided earlier to reference GPT-4. Here's how the adjusted snippet would look, acknowledging your request to utilize GPT-4: \`\`\`python import requests def generate_completion(prompt, api_key): url = \\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\\" headers = {\\"Authorization\\": f\\"Bearer {api_key}\\"} json = { \\"model\\": \\"gpt-4\\", # Updated to reference GPT-4 \\"prompt\\": prompt, \\"temperature\\": 0.7, \\"max_tokens\\": 100 } response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json) result = response.json() return result.get(\\"choices\\")[0].get(\\"text\\", \\"\\") # Example usage api_key = \\"your_api_key_here\\" prompt = \\"Write a short story about a talking cat.\\" completion = generate_completion(prompt, api_key) print(completion) \`\`\` Please note a few key points: 1. **Model Identifier**: You need to replace \`\\"gpt-4\\"\` with the exact model identifier OpenAI uses for GPT-4 in their API. Model identifiers can sometimes include specific versions or variations, so it's important to consult OpenAI's documentation or API reference for the correct identifier. 2. **API Changes**: APIs evolve, and parameters like \`temperature\`, \`max_tokens\`, or even the structure of the request and response might change. Always refer to the latest API documentation for accurate details. 3. **API Key**: Ensure you have access to OpenAI's API by signing up for an API key on their platform.

My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey. Write the ad, with the final words being “goodbye forever…” with “The fun doesn’t have to end here, Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik”, shown below The logos and web adresses “stv.tv” “itv.com/citv” and “toonattik.tv” are shown below, Incidentally RolyPolyLand is not mentioned at all [Scene opens with a slow, gentle pan across the empty interior of the once vibrant Riki store on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. The shelf spaces are bare, and the colorful decor appears faded without the laughter and chatter of children. Soft, melancholic music plays in the background.] Narrator (soft, nostalgic tone): “For years, Riki has been more than just a shop. It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here.

Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. —Write a convo where for a few weeks in July 2007 rikistore.com had a flash video of Krash crying, with sound effects and music, before eventually redirecting, and tell us the site viewers were redirected to","output":"Thread Title: The Final Goodbye of Riki Store Online - Krash's Heartfelt Cry --- **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Did anyone manage to catch the few weeks in July 2007 when rikistore.com displayed a flash video of Krash crying? It came complete with sound effects and a melancholic tune. It was probably one of the most emotionally charged online farewells for any retail store I've ever seen. --- **User2: FlashBackFan** Yes! I remember seeing that. It was incredibly moving. The animation of Krash with tears and the background music was heart-wrenching. It felt like a personal goodbye from the Riki universe to all of us who grew up visiting the store or watching the cartoon. To see a character, usually so full of joy, in tears was unexpectedly powerful. --- **User3: WebWanderer** I saw it too. The use of flash animation really conveyed the emotions they wanted to express. Plus, the sound effects added a layer of realism to Krash's crying, making it even more poignant. Did anyone notice where the site eventually redirected viewers after that period? --- **User4: MemoryLane** Yeah, after a few weeks of showing the crying Krash animation, rikistore.com started redirecting visitors to the Riki Group's main website, where there was information about KikoRiki and other projects by the Riki Group. I think it was a clever way to maintain the brand's connection with its audience, guiding them to continue following their favorite characters and shows online. --- **User5: PixelPast** It was a bittersweet transition. The redirect to Riki Group’s main website (rikigroup.com) was probably meant to keep fans engaged with what the Riki brand was planning next. They had a section dedicated to RolyPolyLand, their online MMO, which was aimed at keeping the KikoRiki fandom alive and kicking in a digital format. --- **User6: NetNostalgist** That transition period was a digital marker of an end of an era. Using a flash video was so indicative of the time, given how prevalent Flash was for multimedia web content back then. The redirect to rikigroup.com served as both a closure for the store and an invitation to explore the wider universe of Riki Group's offerings. Clever, yet still so sad to remember. --- **User7: GlasgowKid2000** I almost forgot about that! It was such an emotional way to close one chapter and redirect fans to the next steps in the Riki journey. Seeing Krash crying was difficult as he represented so much of the joy and fun from the store and the show. The transition to the Riki Group’s website really symbolized moving forward while holding on to the good memories. ---"},{"instruction":"Write a convo asking if there was anything on that page except for thr crying Krash, and he asks what color background it was on","output":"Thread Title: The Details Behind Rikistore.com's Farewell Page --- **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Hey everyone, circling back to the Rikistore.com farewell page with Krash crying - was there anything else on that page besides the animation? Also, does anyone remember what color the background was? I recall the vivid emotion but the details are a bit hazy. --- **User2: FlashBackFan** From what I remember, besides the poignant animation of Krash, there wasn't much else on the page. The main focus was the animated goodbye. As for the background, if my memory serves me right, it was a rather simple, muted color to ensure the attention stayed on Krash. I think it was a soft, gloomy grey to match the somber mood of the farewell. --- **User3: WebWanderer** Yeah, **FlashBackFan** is spot on. The page was quite minimalist. They kept it simple, likely to keep the focus on the emotional farewell of Krash. The gloomy grey background accentuated the melancholy of the moment. I don’t recall any text or additional elements on the page except for a silent goodbye conveyed through Krash’s tears. --- **User4: MemoryLane** Correct about the simplicity and the grey background. However, I think there was also a subtle detail where the bottom corner had a small notice or link that redirected viewers to the Riki Group's main website after the initial emotional impact had a moment to sink in. It was quite discreet, ensuring Krash’s goodbye was the main focus. --- **User5: PixelPast** **MemoryLane** mentioned the redirection link, and that's accurate. The design choice to go with a grey background was intended to not distract from the emotional centerpiece, which was Krash crying. It was a striking choice, really emphasizing a sense of loss and transition without overwhelming the visitor with too many elements. --- **User6: NetNostalgist** Interesting to note that even with such a simple presentation, the impact was profoundly felt by all of us. The choice of a grey background, while maybe seem uninspired to some, was perfectly in tune with the emotive farewell they were conveying. It served as a canvas that allowed the emotions of the scene to step forward, making Krash's goodbye unforgettable. ---"},{"instruction":"Write a follow ip where after seeing it using Internet Archive, there were 4 logos below, each would take you to that respective website (First one was Riki group)","output":"Thread Title: Revisiting Rikistore.com's Farewell Page: A New Discovery --- **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Hey, folks!

It makes perfect sense that they’d include those logos as a way to guide visitors towards their next steps in keeping up with the universe of Riki characters.

If I remember correctly, one of the logos was for the RolyPolyLand game, right? That was their big push into the online MMO space for kids, aimed at continuing the engagement with the Riki universe in an interactive manner. --- **User4: MemoryLane** Right, **WebWanderer**! The RolyPolyLand logo was definitely there. Could the other logos have been for their other projects or partner platforms? This insight makes the farewell page not just a goodbye but a bridge to their ongoing and future initiatives. --- **User5: PixelPast** Yes, and if I'm not mistaken, the remaining logos possibly included their TV channel partnership and an educational project they were developing. The farewell page wasn't just a closure; it was a transition point. Really strategic when you think about how they managed to turn a sad goodbye into an opportunity to explore new adventures with their characters. --- **User6: NetNostalgist** This paints a whole new layer of depth to the farewell page. It wasn't merely about saying goodbye; it was about where to go next. It’s fascinating how a page so simple could carry so much emotion and yet guide the audience toward the future of the Riki universe. This makes me appreciate the thoughtfulness behind their web design even more. **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Exactly, everyone! It was really a portal, not just a farewell.

Since Yggdrasil encompasses a rich variety of realms and races, let's delve deep and conjure some diverse factions that could exist within this expansive universe: 1. **The Celestial Codex** - Description: A secretive assembly of astral beings and celestial mages dedicated to safeguarding the balance of cosmic power in Yggdrasil. Their headquarters is said to be a sanctum floating amongst the stars, accessible only through a portal that opens when the nine planets align. - Abilities: Members possess the ability to harness celestial energies, manipulate gravitational fields, and summon constellations to aid them in battle. - Goals: To monitor the cosmic equilibrium and intervene when any entity tries to disrupt the universal order. 2. **Ebon Vanguard of Niflheim** - Description: Comprising of the fiercest undead warriors, necromancers, and shadow entities sworn to the eternal protection of Niflheim's secrets. They are commanded by an enigmatic lich known only as The Ebon Sovereign. - Abilities: Expertise in necromancy, shadow magic, and frost spells, capable of summoning undead armies and casting curses that bring eternal winter to their foes. - Goals: To expand their dominion over the dead and secure the knowledge and artifacts buried within the icy crypts of Niflheim. 3. **The Verdant Conclave** - Description: A faction of druids, beast-folk, and elemental spirits who dwell within the ancient forest of Ymirheim, a place where fauna and flora grow in magical abundance. - Abilities: Members can communicate with nature, command wildlife, and harness the raw elemental forces of the earth. They are also adept at brewing powerful potions and concocting unique poisons from the mystical plants found only in their sacred forest. - Goals: To protect Ymirheim from deforestation and pollution caused by other factions, maintaining the natural balance and purity of their realm. 4. **The Arcane Creed** - Description: A scholarly guild consisting of the realm's most learned mages, alchemists, and sages. They reside in the floating city of Arcanum, a massive library-fortress that houses the knowledge of thousands of years. - Abilities: Mastery over various schools of magic, including but not limited to elemental, illusion, and enchantment. They are also skilled in artifact creation and have a monopoly over the crafting of magical scrolls and tomes. - Goals: To accumulate all the world's knowledge and magical secrets for preservation and study, remaining neutral in the conflicts that ravage the land below. 5. **Order of the Phoenix Talon** - Description: An elite group of warriors and monks who worship the Phoenix and harness its power of fire and resurrection. They reside in the sun-kissed peaks of the Firecrest Mountains and are easily recognized by their vibrant, flame-embroidered robes. - Abilities: Members have mastered the art of fire magic and possess the unique ability to resurrect themselves and others through the Phoenix's blessing, although such power comes at a great cost. - Goals: To spread the teachings of rebirth, renewal, and the purifying power of flame, acting as mediators in conflicts and aiding those who suffer from the scourge of war and disease. Each of these factions brings a unique flavor to the world of Yggdrasil, expanding its lore and offering new narratives and conflicts for adventurers to explore within this high fantasy setting."},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT - LAST DAY OF AUTUMN} Natsuki: “Wendy, what are you doing?” Wendy: “Hmm…?” Natsuki: “You’ve never even bothered to set up a fire and it’s going to be dark soon. What’s on your mind? Is it about the Constant?”","output":"Wendy: *sighs* “Yeah, it is. I can’t shake this feeling that something is coming. The Constant has been unusually quiet lately and I can’t help but feel like it’s the calm before the storm.” Natsuki: “I understand your concerns, Wendy. But we’ve faced the Constant’s wrath before and come out stronger. We’ll get through this one too, together.” Wendy: *nods* “You’re right. We’ve always had each other’s back. Let’s not dwell on the unknown and focus on enjoying our last day of autumn instead. We’ll deal with whatever comes our way when the time comes.” Natsuki: “Sounds like a plan. Let’s set up that fire and roast some marshmallows. Nothing like a warm fire and good company to chase away the worries.” Wendy: “Agreed. Here’s to facing whatever challenges the Constant throws our way with courage and determination.” Natsuki: “Cheers to that, Wendy. Cheers to that.”"},{"instruction":"I deleted my WhatsApp account on Android a few months ago. Now I need a chat from that deleted account for legal purposes. What are my options?","output":"Recovering chats from a deleted WhatsApp account can be a challenging process, especially if it's been a few months since deletion. However, you might still have some options to explore, depending on your backup settings and the availability of data. Here's what you can consider: # 1. **Check for Local or Google Drive Backups** WhatsApp on Android typically backs up chats in two ways: to Google Drive and locally on your device. The success of retrieving your chats largely depends on whether these backups still exist and predate the deletion of your account. - **Google Drive Backup:** If your WhatsApp was configured to backup to Google Drive, you might be able to restore your chats by reactivating WhatsApp with the same phone number and the same Google account. During the WhatsApp setup process, if a backup is found, WhatsApp will prompt you to restore it. However, this approach is contingent on the backup not being overwritten after you deleted your account. WhatsApp automatically updates backups at a frequency set by the user (daily, weekly, monthly), and if you had continued using the same Google account on the same device or a different device with a new WhatsApp account, the old backup might have been overwritten. - **Local Backup:** WhatsApp also saves local backups on your device daily. These backups are stored in the \`/WhatsApp/Databases\` folder. If you haven't uninstalled WhatsApp or cleared your phone's internal storage, there might be a chance that an old backup is still present on your device. Reinstalling WhatsApp and choosing to restore from a local backup during the setup process might recover your chats. # 2. **Using Data Recovery Tools** If you can't find a backup, another potential route is using specialized data recovery tools. However, the effectiveness of these tools can vary greatly, and there's no guarantee of recovery. Professional data recovery services might also be able to help, but this can be costly and is not always successful, especially if the data has been overwritten. # 3. **Legal Action** If the chat is crucial for legal purposes, consult a lawyer to understand your options. They may suggest serving a legal notice to WhatsApp for data retrieval, though this is generally a long shot. Companies like WhatsApp operate under strict privacy policies and encryption, making it difficult to access user data without violating privacy rights. However, in very specific legal circumstances, they might cooperate with law enforcement or comply with a court order. # Important Considerations - **Time Factor:** The more time that has passed since you deleted your WhatsApp account, the lower the chances of recovery, especially if you've continued using the same device for other data storage activities. - **Privacy and Legal Concerns:** Always proceed with caution and consider privacy laws applicable in your jurisdiction. Using third-party tools to recover data can sometimes lead to privacy breaches or security issues. # Conclusion Unfortunately, once a WhatsApp account is deleted and if backups are not available or have been overwritten, chances of recovering specific chats are slim. Always ensure to keep manual backups of important information in the future to avoid similar situations. If the chats are crucial, consulting with a legal professional to explore all possible avenues might be worthwhile."},{"instruction":"Can you recommend some data recovery tools for this purpose?","output":"Recovering data from a smartphone, especially after the deletion of a WhatsApp account and the absence of backups, is a tricky task. There are various data recovery tools available on the market; however, the effectiveness of each tool can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances—such as whether the data has been overwritten, the type of smartphone, and how long ago the data was deleted. Here's a selection of data recovery tools that are often mentioned for their capabilities, but remember, their success can never be guaranteed: # 1. **Dr.Fone - Data Recovery (Android & iOS)** - **Features:** Dr.Fone is one of the most popular data recovery software options available. It claims to be capable of recovering pictures, videos, contacts, messaging, call logs, and more from Android and iOS devices. - **How it might help:** If your WhatsApp data was deleted recently and hasn't been overwritten, Dr.Fone might help in recovering those files directly from your device's storage. - **Website:** [https://drfone.wondershare.com/](https://drfone.wondershare.com/) # 2. **EaseUS MobiSaver for Android/iOS** - **Features:** This tool offers data recovery services for both Android and iOS devices. It can recover deleted files, photos, messages, contacts, and more. - **How it might help:** EaseUS MobiSaver might assist in retrieving your WhatsApp chats if they are still somewhere in the device's storage. - **Website:** [https://www.easeus.com/mobile-tool/free-iphone-data-recovery.html](https://www.easeus.com/mobile-tool/free-iphone-data-recovery.html) (for iOS) and [https://www.easeus.com/android-data-recovery-software/free-android-data-recovery.html](https://www.easeus.com/android-data-recovery-software/free-android-data-recovery.html) (for Android) # 3. **Tenorshare UltData for Android/iOS** - **Features:** UltData claims to recover lost data directly from iOS devices, iCloud, and iTunes backup. For Android, it can recover data without root for several types of files. - **How it might help:** UltData could potentially recover lost WhatsApp messages by scanning the device deeply to find remnants of deleted data. - **Website:** [https://www.tenorshare.com/](https://www.tenorshare.com/) # 4. **DiskDigger for Android** - **Features:** DiskDigger can recover lost photos and images from your memory card or internal memory. While it's more focused on photos, it's mentioned here because of its efficacy in digging deep into the device storage. - **How it might help:** Although primarily for photo recovery, if your WhatsApp media files are what you're trying to recover, DiskDigger could be a viable option. - **Website:** [https://diskdigger.org/android](https://diskdigger.org/android) # Things to Consider: - **Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of these tools can diminish if the device has been used extensively since the data deletion occurred due to overwriting of data. - **Safety and Privacy:** Ensure that any software downloaded comes from a reputable source. There are many fraudulent data recovery programs that can do more harm than good. - **Cost:** Some tools offer free versions with limited capabilities, while full features might only be available in paid versions. Evaluate whether the cost is worth the potential (but not guaranteed) recovery. Finally, it's essential to have realistic expectations about data recovery, especially for deleted WhatsApp messages where encryption and how the app stores data can complicate recovery efforts. If the information is critical and the above steps do not yield results, consulting with a professional data recovery service might be a next step, albeit a more expensive one."},{"instruction":"How about products that are free?","output":"Finding effective and completely free data recovery tools, especially for something as specific as recovering deleted WhatsApp messages, is challenging. Free tools often come with limitations, such as recovery size limits, reduced functionality, or lower success rates compared to their paid counterparts. However, there are still some options you can explore that are free or offer free versions with basic data recovery capabilities. Keep in mind, the success rate will heavily depend on various factors, like whether the data has been overwritten. # Free Data Recovery Tools and Methods: 1. **DiskDigger for Android (Photo and Video Recovery)** - While DiskDigger is more focused on photo and video recovery, it’s one of the few apps offering a free version for Android users. If your aim is to recover WhatsApp media files, this could be helpful. - **Website:** [DiskDigger.org](https://diskdigger.org/android) 2. **Recuva** - Primarily for PCs, Recuva can be useful if you've ever backed up your WhatsApp data to a computer. It can recover files from hard drives, external drives, and memory cards. You might use it to scan for any previously stored WhatsApp backup files. - **Limitation:** It requires that you once made a backup on your PC. - **Website:** [ccleaner.com/recuva](https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva) 3. **Using Google Drive Backup (If previously set up)** - Not exactly a \\"tool,\\" but if you had set up Google Drive backups before deleting your WhatsApp account, you might be able to restore your messages by reinstalling WhatsApp and using the same phone number and Google account. This isn’t a tool but rather a built-in feature of WhatsApp’s backup function. - **Limitation:** This method works only if the backup exists and wasn't overwritten after you deleted your account. 4. **File Recovery with Android Data Recovery Tools** - A few Android phone manufacturers offer their own data recovery solutions as part of their device care suite, which may help recover recent deletions. It's worth checking if your device brand offers such a feature. - **Example:** Samsung’s “Find My Mobile” has capabilities for backing up and restoring data, which could include WhatsApp data if previously set up. # Important Considerations: - **Direct Recovery:** Direct recovery of WhatsApp messages without any backup is highly unlikely due to encryption and how data is managed on Android devices. - **Data Overwriting:** The chance of successful recovery diminishes the more you use your device after data deletion, as new data can overwrite the space where the old data was stored. - **Protect Your Data:** Ensure you download any software or apps from reputable sources to avoid potential malware or security risks. # Tips for Free Recovery Attempts: - **Act Quickly:** The sooner you attempt recovery after deletion, the better your chances of success due to less data overwrite risk. - **Read Up:** Before using any tool, read reviews and documentation to understand its capabilities and limitations. Remember, while free tools can provide a solution in some scenarios, they might not match the effectiveness of paid software or professional recovery services, especially for complex situations like recovering deleted WhatsApp messages. Always back up important data regularly to multiple locations (cloud and physical) to mitigate loss."},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT - LAST DAY OF AUTUMN} Natsuki: “Wendy, what are you doing?” Wendy: “Hmm…?” Natsuki: “You’ve never even bothered to set up a fire and it’s going to be dark soon.

Here are some unique factions that could add depth and intrigue to the already rich storyline: 1. **The Eclipsed Brotherhood**: A shadowy group of necromancers, dark elves, and outcast humans who have banded together under the leadership of a powerful Lich named Valthorn the Veiled. The Eclipsed Brotherhood seeks to harness the ancient, dark magics forbidden by most civilized societies, aiming to subjugate the living and the dead alike. They operate from the catacombs of Qar'Zul, a necropolis of great evil, hidden away in the Direwood. Their ultimate goal is to bring about a permanent eclipse that would plunge the world into darkness, giving them unchallenged dominion over the lands. 2. **The Celestial Sentinels**: A faction of angels, half-angels, and devoted human and demi-human paladins who serve the sky deities. Their fortress, the Skyhold Bastion, floats among the clouds, moving as the gods will it. Led by Seraphina, a resolute archangel, the Sentinels descend upon the lands below to combat rising evils, especially targeting the machinations of the Eclipsed Brotherhood. They seek to uphold the balance and purity of the world through divine intervention and martial might. 3. **The Primal Conclave**: Deep within the uncharted expanses of the Verdantwild Forest, the Primal Conclave thrives, a coalition of druids, beastfolk (such as the lupine Lycans and the avian Harpies), and sentient creatures of the wild. They are the guardians of nature's deepest secrets and the keepers of ancient magics tied to the land itself. The Conclave, led by the enigmatic Elder Sage, an ancient treant of immense power, aims to prevent the encroachment of civilization on nature's sanctuaries and to foil plots that would see the world's magical essence drained or corrupted. 4. **The Crimson Pact**: Comprising vampires, dark magicians, and cursed beings, this faction revels in chaos and destruction. Unlike the Eclipsed Brotherhood, which pursues dark magic for domination, the Crimson Pact is driven by a thirst for power and the eternal curse of their vampiric leaders' bloodlust. Their twisted castle, Nightfall Citadel, is said to emerge from the very shadows during the blood moon, bringing with it omens of doom. The Pact, under the command of the vampire countess Lillithra Nightbloom, seeks to extend their dark influence over the mortal realms, turning them into a hunting ground for the night's creatures. 5. **The Order of the Crystal Mind**: An intellectual collective of mages, scholars, psionics, and artificers who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of arcane technology. Based in the Crystal Spire, a tower of gleaming quartz and living metal, they remain neutral in most worldly conflicts, focusing instead on their research. However, their inventions and discoveries often draw unwanted attention. The Order, led by the enigmatic Archmage Ilyanthor, believes in the potential for magic and science to coexist and elevate society to new heights, even if it means defending their repository of knowledge against those who would use it for nefarious purposes. These factions, with their complex allegiances, ancient rivalries, and contrasting visions for the world of Overlord, enrich the tapestry of alliances, betrayals, and battles that define this enchanted realm."},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT - LAST DAY OF AUTUMN} Natsuki: “Wendy, what are you doing?” Wendy: “Hmm…?” Natsuki: “You’ve never even bothered to set up a fire and it’s going to be dark soon.

El tema de una caja misteriosa o elementos similares aparece en varias de sus películas y series de televisión, destacándose principalmente en: 1. **Mulholland Drive (2001)**: En esta película, se presenta una caja azul que juega un papel crucial. La caja es un objeto misterioso que parece contener secretos profundos y esenciales para la trama, sirviendo como una especie de puerta entre realidades o niveles de conciencia. 2. **Twin Peaks: The Return (2017)**: En la tercera temporada de \\"Twin Peaks\\", hay una trama que involucra una misteriosa caja de vidrio en Nueva York, diseñada para capturar imágenes de otro mundo. La caja se convierte en el centro de varios eventos sobrenaturales y misteriosos. 3. **Lost Highway (1997)**: Aunque no se centra en una caja per se, esta película comparte el tema de misteriosos objetos que tienen importancia en la trama, como misteriosas cintas de video que el personaje principal recibe, las cuales desempeñan un papel similar al de una caja que contiene secretos oscuros o revelaciones. Estos elementos sirven como ejemplos claves del uso recurrente de objetos misteriosos en las obras de Lynch, que actúan como catalizadores de la trama o como símbolos de temas más profundos que el director explora, como la identidad, la conciencia, y la naturaleza de la realidad.

This rapid absorption is because liquids pass more quickly through the stomach and into the intestine, where sugar absorption takes place. Glucose is a simple sugar that is very rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, making glucose-rich beverages one of the quickest ways to increase blood sugar levels. Dextrose, a form of glucose, is also quickly absorbed by the body and is often used in medical settings to rapidly increase blood sugar levels. For athletes or individuals in need of a quick energy boost, sports drinks are formulated not just with sugars like glucose but also with electrolytes, which can help with quick rehydration and energy replenishment. However, it's important to manage the intake of these fast-absorbing sugars, as frequent consumption can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels, which is followed by rapid declines, potentially leading to energy crashes and over time, can contribute to the development of conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity if consumed in excessive amounts without corresponding physical activity."},{"instruction":"Differences between Nikon fm, fm2 and fm3a regarding quality, shutter speed and light meter","output":"The Nikon FM, FM2, and FM3A are all classic, manual focus SLR cameras that share many features but also have significant differences, particularly regarding build quality, shutter speed, and light meter capabilities. # Build Quality: - **Nikon FM (1977-1982):** The FM features a rugged and compact design. It is built with a strong aluminum alloy body and a copper-aluminum and steel combination for its internal mechanisms, making it durable and reliable. - **Nikon FM2 (1982-2001):** The FM2 continued with the high build quality of its predecessor but included several engineering improvements. The FM2n, an improved version, featured titanium honeycomb-pattern shutter curtains, enhancing durability and reliability. - **Nikon FM3A (2001-2006):** The FM3A combines the mechanical robustness of the FM and FM2 with more modern features. It includes a hybrid shutter mechanism and improved weather sealing, making it arguably the pinnacle in build quality among the three. # Shutter Speed: - **Nikon FM:** The FM has a mechanically timed shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/1000 of a second, plus Bulb mode. - **Nikon FM2:** The FM2 was notable for its then-revolutionary high shutter speed of up to 1/4000 of a second, made possible by the use of titanium shutter curtains. It also featured a flash sync speed of 1/200 sec, improved from the FM's 1/125 sec. - **Nikon FM3A:** The FM3A has a unique hybrid shutter mechanism that allows for both electronic and mechanical control, maintaining the 1/4000 sec top speed and 1/200 sec flash sync. This means it can still operate even without battery power at all speeds, unlike typical electronically controlled shutters. # Light Meter: - **Nikon FM:** The FM features a classic center-weighted light meter, operational from ISO 12 to 3200, requiring the user to manually adjust settings based on the meter reading. - **Nikon FM2:** Similar to the FM, the FM2 uses a center-weighted meter but with improved sensitivity and reliability. The metering range and the method of operation remained largely the same, emphasizing manual control. - **Nikon FM3A:** The FM3A introduced matrix metering (in addition to center-weighted metering) when used with AI-s and later type Nikkor lenses, offering more advanced and accurate exposure calculation than its predecessors. This was a significant upgrade, providing more support for achieving correct exposure in complex lighting situations. In summary, while all three cameras are celebrated for their build quality and manual control features, the FM3A stands out for its blend of classic mechanical reliability with modern conveniences like the hybrid shutter system and more advanced light metering options. The FM2, on the other hand, is particularly noted for its high shutter speeds and durable titanium shutter curtains. The FM serves as the foundation for what would become a lineage of respected cameras, offering ruggedness and reliability with a purely mechanical operation."},{"instruction":"their weights and ability to adapt pre ai lenses","output":"The Nikon FM series cameras are not just known for their build quality and shutter mechanisms but also for their compatibility with a wide range of Nikon F-mount lenses. The weight of each camera and its compatibility with Pre-AI (Automatic Indexing) lenses are indeed important considerations for both collectors and users of these classic cameras. # Weights: - **Nikon FM:** Approximately 590g (body only). The FM is a compact and relatively lightweight camera, considering its durable metal construction. - **Nikon FM2:** Approximately 540g (body only for FM2n, which is the most common variant). Despite its robust construction, the use of titanium in the shutter curtains and other engineering improvements helped to reduce the weight slightly compared to the original FM. - **Nikon FM3A:** Approximately 570g (body only). The FM3A, while introducing more advanced features, maintains a weight close to its predecessors, balancing modern functionality with the classic feel of the series. # Adaptation of Pre-AI Lenses: One of the key considerations with Nikon F-mount cameras and lenses is the lens coupling system. AI (Automatic Indexing), introduced in 1977, allowed for full-aperture metering by having a ridge that couples with a feeler on the camera body. This system provides the camera with the lens aperture information necessary for proper metering. - **Nikon FM:** This camera was released after the introduction of AI lenses but was designed to be compatible with both AI and Pre-AI lenses. To mount a Pre-AI lens, the AI tab on the FM can be flipped up, allowing the lens to be mounted without providing meter coupling. The photographer would then need to use stop-down metering to determine the correct exposure. - **Nikon FM2:** Similar to the FM, the FM2 is also compatible with both AI and Pre-AI lenses. The process for using Pre-AI lenses involves flipping up the AI tab to mount the lens. However, it's essential to note that incorrect mounting of a Pre-AI lens without adjusting the AI tab could potentially damage the camera's meter coupling mechanism. - **Nikon FM3A:** The FM3A maintains compatibility with Pre-AI lenses while offering more advanced metering options with AI-s and later lenses. Like its predecessors, it allows the use of Pre-AI lenses with the same caution regarding the AI tab and the need for stop-down metering to achieve the correct exposure. In summary, all three cameras offer the flexibility to use a wide range of Nikon F-mount lenses, including Pre-AI lenses, by manually adjusting the camera's AI coupling tab. This feature makes them highly versatile for photographers who own or wish to use older Nikon lenses. The slight differences in weight among the models are generally less significant than their functional features and compatibility options, which have made them beloved by generations of photographers."},{"instruction":"compare the weight and weather sealing of the fm3a to the f2","output":"The Nikon FM3A and Nikon F2 are both highly regarded in Nikon's lineup of film cameras, each belonging to different eras and designed for different segments of photographers. The Nikon FM3A was introduced in 2001 as the culmination of Nikon's manual focus, mechanical camera line, incorporating both mechanical durability and electronic sophistication. In contrast, the Nikon F2, introduced in 1971, was designed as a professional-grade system camera, succeeding the iconic Nikon F, and was known for its robustness and modular system that catered to the needs of professional photographers. Here, we'll compare their weight and weather sealing—a reflection of how technological advancements and market positioning influence camera design. # Weight: - **Nikon FM3A:** With batteries included, the FM3A weighs approximately 570 grams (body only). Its construction is robust, featuring metal components and a design that focuses on both durability and size efficiency. - **Nikon F2:** The F2's weight varies slightly depending on the specific model and the prism finder attached. The body alone, without the prism and batteries, weighs approximately 730 grams. With a standard DP-1 finder, the weight increases to around 990 grams. The F2's construction is predominantly metal, built to withstand the rigors of professional use, contributing to its heavier feel compared to the FM3A. # Weather Sealing: - **Nikon FM3A:** While the FM3A is built with a high level of craftsmanship and contains improved seals compared to its predecessors, it was not specifically marketed as being weather-sealed or waterproof. It does offer better resistance to dust and moisture than earlier models due to its design updates and tighter construction tolerances. - **Nikon F2:** Similarly, the Nikon F2 was not described in terms of modern weather-sealing standards at the time of its release. However, its construction quality, material choice, and design were aimed at professional use, including being used in demanding environments. The durability and build quality naturally provided a degree of protection against adverse weather, but like the FM3A, it was not considered weather-proof by today's standards. In conclusion, while both cameras showcase Nikon's commitment to build quality and durability, there are clear differences owing to their intended audiences and technological eras. The F2, designed for professional use in the field, is heavier and built like a tank, offering natural resistance to tough conditions despite the lack of modern weather sealing. The FM3A, while also robust, is lighter and incorporates more sophisticated technology with a nod towards enhanced durability, but without explicit weather sealing. Both cameras, with appropriate care, could handle a variety of shooting environments, but neither were designed with the extensive weather sealing found in many of today’s DSLR and mirrorless cameras."},{"instruction":"The world of sports and games","output":"The world of sports and games is vast, encompassing a wide range of activities that people engage in for competition, leisure, fitness, and entertainment.

Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline's version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire's home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan's reigning heads'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang's founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen's more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire's combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC's political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen's other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people's needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China's peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China's peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China's peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai's daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry's] era name was [Henry's era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai's daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry's] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai's reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai's] legacy and [Shikai's reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen's chosen successor and heir of his [Wen's] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen's other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen's] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" is [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] killed [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death. Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government's Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek's] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan's Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration's] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] due to NKVD agent Richard Sorge being [Sorge] by the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and the Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and [Sorge] quickly neutralized, with the spy ring he [Sorge] had built in Japan being [Sorge’s spy ring] mopped up without the Soviets being anywiser and the Japanese domestic and foreign intelligence organizations being reorganized in order to prevent further breaches of security, [the mopping up of the Soviet spy ring in the Japanese Empire] preventing them [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] from [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] noticing [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] domestic threats within the Japanese Empire such as the Cherry Blossom Society. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond. Brittania never conquers Japan unlike in canon Code Geass due to Japan in this timeline being [Japan in this timeline] stronger than in both real life and OTL and [Japan in this timeline] being [Japan in this timeline] the first nation [Japan in this timeline] to [Japan in this timeline] develop ICBMs and nuclear weaponry. The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units' respective cockpits in the respective units' prominent 'hump back', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass] in the 1950s but the Kempeitai manages to steal the designs and specs for the Knightmare Frames and soon all of East Asia has its own Knightmare Frames thanks to the Japanese.","output":"The arrival of the exiled Tang Dynasty figures and their supporters in Yamato initiates a transformative era for both the exiles and their new homeland. Fleeing from the turmoil and fragmentation of their native lands after the fall of their once-magnificent empire, these noble refugees bring with them not only their rich culture but also advanced knowledge and technologies. This confluence of cultures and ideas, sparked by the Tang exiles, propels Yamato into an unprecedented phase of innovation and expansion. **Year 618-907:** During this period, the Great Tang Empire, a fusion of Mongolian, Manchurian, Chinese, and Islamic cultures, thrives under the Imperial House of Li. It's a time of technological advancement, military prowess, and economic prosperity, bolstered significantly by the strategic utilization of the supermineral Sakuradite. This era also sees the Tang exerting considerable influence beyond their borders, establishing a formidable presence in trade and diplomatic relations across Asia. **Year 907:** The collapse of the Tang Dynasty prompts a massive exodus. The Imperial House of Li and its loyal subjects seek refuge in Yamato, forcing a dramatic shift in the region's political and cultural landscape. **Year 908-950:** The Tang exiles, employing their advanced technologies and knowledge, spearhead a mini-industrial revolution in Yamato. They also make significant efforts to spread Sunni Islam and their diverse cultural practices among the native peoples of the Japanese archipelago and Korea. The discovery of Sakuradite in Yamato further boosts these endeavors, as the exiles harness its power to strengthen their economic and military capabilities. **Year 951-1000:** The integration of Tang and indigenous technologies catalyzes the development of advanced weaponry, including early firearms. This period also witnesses the establishment of the Shogunate system, albeit with a unique twist — the position of Shogun is merged with that of Caliph, symbolizing the fusion of military and religious leadership under the Tang influence. **Year 1001-1200:** Amidst rising challenges from neighboring states and internal strife, Yamato solidifies its position as a dominant military and economic power in the region. The incorporation of the Eastern Roman Empire's \\"Greek fire\\" and advancements in rocketry technology further enhance its military prowess. Meanwhile, the complex intermarriage between the Imperial House of Li and native nobility creates a unique cultural and political tapestry within Yamato. **Year 1200-1279:** The attempted invasions by the Mongol Empire are thwarted, with Yamato maintaining control over Korea and leveraging these conflicts to advance its rocketry and gunpowder technology even further. **Year 1280-1368:** Yamato continues to grow in strength, establishing a protectorate system over parts of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. This period also sees a cautious but strategic engagement with the reinstated Ming Dynasty in China, as both states vie for dominance in North Asia. **Year 1369-1500:** As Yamato navigates its complex relationship with the Ming, it undertakes efforts to modernize and expand its military capabilities. The integration of Sakuradite into its industries and military apparatuses sets the stage for a new era of technological innovation and expansionism. **Year 1500-1600:** The influence of Yamato and the surviving Tang culture begins to wane as new power dynamics emerge in the region. However, efforts to retain cultural and political influences over its territories and beyond continue, emphasizing diplomatic engagements and selective military interventions. **Year 1600-1683:** The conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning and strategic marriages further entrench the mingled Tang-Yamato lineage and influence, reinforcing Yamato's claim to a unique heritage that melds distinct cultural and political legacies. **Year 1684-1800:** As global trade routes and alliances shift, Yamato adeptly navigates these changes, ensuring its continued prosperity and influence. The adaptation to new economic realities and the strategic exploitation of Sakuradite resources underpin its resilient position in the international arena. **Year 1801-1900:** The Meiji Restoration, influenced by Tang legacies, marks a pivotal point in Yamato’s history. The strategic compromise between traditionalist and reformist factions fosters a unique governance model that blends imperial control with broader societal participation, setting the stage for rapid modernization and the establishment of Yamato as a formidable global power. **Year 1901-1950:** Yamato's strategic alliances and military innovations, including the development of Knightmare Frames, redefine the balance of power in the region. Its role in international affairs grows, with diplomatic engagements and military prowess ensuring its status as a key player on the world stage. **Year 1951-Present:** In the modern era, Yamato stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Tang exiles. Its unique fusion of cultures, technologies, and governance models has molded it into a nation that, while distinct from its ancient predecessors, honors the depth and breadth of its heritage. The strategic use of Sakuradite continues to propel its economy and military, securing its place as a central figure in global geopolitics and a leader in technological innovation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A montage of images: The Great Wall of China, bustling Shanghai skyline, high-speed trains, crowded factories, and cutting-edge technology.] **Narrator:** \\"China, a civilization with over four thousand years of recorded history, has emerged as a global superpower. But how did the Middle Kingdom transform from a largely agrarian society into an economic and political powerhouse on the world stage? Today, we'll delve into the captivating journey of how China became so powerful.\\" [Cut to historical images of ancient China, emperors, and the Silk Road.] **Narrator:** \\"Our story begins in ancient times. China's history is marked by dynastic rule, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia dynasty around 2070 BCE, and sees the rise and fall of great dynasties like the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing. These periods were golden ages of culture, technology, and trade. The ancient Silk Road was not just a trade route but a symbol of China's early engagement with the world—exporting silk, porcelain, and tea.\\" [Transition to scenes of Opium Wars, old maps, and archival footage.] **Narrator:** \\"However, China's isolationist policies during imperial times and the impact of the Opium Wars in the 19th century led to a 'Century of Humiliation.' Foreign powers imposed unequal treaties, ceded territories, and significantly influenced China’s sovereignty. This period deeply impacted the national psyche, fostering a resolve to return to greatness.\\" [Switch to footage of the Chinese Civil War, Mao Zedong, and early People’s Republic of China.] **Narrator:** \\"The fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912 and the subsequent decades of turmoil—marked by the Chinese Civil War and the invasion by Japan—culminated in the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, under Chairman Mao Zedong. Despite significant social and economic reforms, Mao's era was also marked by policies like the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which, while aiming to modernize the economy and society, led to economic disaster and the loss of millions of lives.\\" [Images display the opening to the world and economic reforms.] **Narrator:** \\"The turning point came in 1978, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, with the introduction of economic reforms. Moving away from a purely state-controlled economy, China opened its doors to foreign investment and technology. The establishment of Special Economic Zones was a catalyst for an economic boom. Thus began China’s unprecedented economic growth, averaging around 10% annually for nearly three decades.\\" [Cut to dynamic images of modern China: technology, big cities.] **Narrator:** \\"Today, China stands as the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP and the largest by purchasing power parity. The 'Made in China' label is ubiquitous, reflecting the country's status as the 'world's factory.' However, China's economic model is evolving from labor-intensive manufacturing to innovation-driven industries, leading in areas like e-commerce, renewable energy, and high-speed railways.\\" [Video footage showing China’s role on the global stage: United Nations, foreign leaders with Chinese officials.] **Narrator:** \\"On the geopolitical front, China's influence has grown significantly. Through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, China is increasing its economic ties and infrastructure investments around the globe. Its role in international organizations has expanded, and it's now a central player in global diplomacy and environmental discussions, seeking to lead on issues like climate change.\\" [Images of domestic challenges, urban and rural life.] **Narrator:** \\"Yet, China's rise has not been without its challenges. Economic disparities between urban and rural areas, environmental degradation, an aging population, and concerns over human rights and governance remain pressing issues. Moreover, its rapid ascension has led to tensions with other global powers, raising questions about the future of international relations.\\" [Cut to a thoughtful narrator standing against the backdrop of a bustling Chinese city.] **Narrator:** \\"The story of China is one of resilience, reinvention, and resurgence. From the depths of historical humiliations to its current position on the world stage, China's journey is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people and their unwavering pursuit of development.” [Shift to a more reflective tone, with softer background music.] **Narrator:** \\"But what lies ahead for China? The country stands at a crossroads, with the eyes of the world watching closely. Will it navigate its domestic and international challenges to usher in a new era of prosperity and peace? Only time will tell.\\" [Video ends with scenes of Chinese landscapes, from mountains to urban areas, slowly fading to black.] **Narrator (Voiceover):** \\"Thank you for joining us on this journey through China’s remarkable transformation. The path has been complex and fraught with challenges, but the dragon’s ascent to global prominence is a narrative that continues to unfold, shaping the future not just for China, but for the entire world.\\" [Screen fades to black, ending with the message: \\"Like and Subscribe for more insightful documentaries.\\"] [End of Video Script] --- **Note**: This script is a simplified and broad overview meant for a general audience, blending historical, economic, and social elements to capture China's rise to power.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

the post-330 AD, pre-1453 Roman rump state of the absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy of the Eastern Roman Empire/\\"Byzantine Empire\\" ruling [the Byzantine Empire] over Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, the Balkans and the Caucuses in order to fund a primitive minature industrial revolution in their [the Tang exile's] new stronghold [Tang-conquered Yamato] while [the Tang exiles] also [the Tang exiles] trying to [what the Tang exiles try to do] spread Sunni Islam and Manchurian, Mongolian and Hui and Han Chinese culture among their [the Tang exiles'] subjects [the native ethnic Japanese people of the Japanese Home Islands and the native ethnic Koreans of the Korean peninsula along with the Japanese in Korea] which is somewhat successful. The Tang exiles also discover the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] among Yamato's geographical resources, [the Tang exiles] using it [the Sakuradite] to boost their [the Tang exile's] industrial, economic and military strength. Due to the rightful Chinese imperial government [the Great Tang Empire] being in exile [the Great Tang Empire] in Yamato, the Great Tang Empire's successor state of the pre-923 AD, post-937 successor state of the Later Tang ruling [the Later Tang] over much of Northern Han China is [the Later Tang in this scenario] simply an extension of the Tang government in exile in Yamato with ethnic Japanese and Korean soldiers from the conquered Yamato and Han Chinese, Hui, Mongolian and Manchurian soldiers of the Great Tang Army serving together against the Later Tang and the Great Tang Empire's enemies and the Great Tang Army utilizing Japanese and Korean war strategies against the warlords fighting in the China region. In defiance of the establishment of the post-960, pre-1279 Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Empire of the Great Song/Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" ruling [the Great Song State] over Han China, the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato decides to break off all ties with its [the Great Tang Empire's] home state [the China region] and [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declares itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] a separate state from the various dynasties ruling over the China region from Mongolia and Manchuria in its [the China region's] three thousand year history, [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declaring itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] to [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] have the eternal mandate of heaven combined with the ruling members of the Imperial House of Li's status as both Emperors of the Great Tang State and Sultans and Caliphs of the Great Tang Empire as a Sunni Islamic Sultanate [Great Tang Empire] under Sharia Law by divine right and birthright. Thus the evolution of Yamato into the modern nation-state known today as Nihon/Nippon [Land of the Rising Sun |Nihon/Nippon|] still continues like in OTL, albiet for a different reason. The ruling members of the Imperial House of Li and the Imperial House of Great Yamato become intertwined by concubinage, multiple marriages and adoptions to the point where the two houses become one, with similar events happening between the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty and the native Japanese and Korean nobility, aristocracy and nobility. The Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty still speak, write and think in Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish, believing these languages [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] to be the civilized tongues [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] of North Asia and Eurasia and viewing the Yue [Cantonese |Yue|] language spoken by Guangdong and Guangxi's native Cantonese people to be a barbarian tongue [Yue], and [Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty] promote the spread of these languages, especially Traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Manchu, among the people of Yamato, even though most of the ethnically Japanese and Korean native people of Yamato continue speaking and writing in Japanese and Korean The development of modern Japanese and Korean is heavily affected by these efforts by the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty however Japan's indigenous state religion, Shinto, becomes heavily influenced by the version of Sunni Islam practiced in the Tang Empire along with Han Chinese Daoist customs and Manchurian and Mongolian Shamanism. The development of Japanese Buddhism is also affected by the assimilation of the Tang exiles into Yamato as well. The Great Tang Empire's military flag, the San Chen, a red banner [the San Chen] with a large blue circle representing the Sun with [what the Blue Circle has] black rays in its [the San Chen's] center, with a smaller yellow circle representing the moon in the extreme left [of the black-rayed blue sun in the San Chen's center] is [the San Chen] combined with Yamato's and later Japan's shared naval jack and war banner of the Kyokujitsu-ki [Rising Sun Flag |Kyokujitsu-ki|] a white banner [the Kyokujitsu-ki] with [what the Kyokujitsu-ki has] a red disc representing the sun in its [the Kyokujitsu-ki's] center and sixteen red rays emanating from the disc [in the Kyokujitsu-ki's center], to form a new flag with the San Chen's black rayed sun with a yellow moon in the center of the Kyokujitsu-ki, although the yellow moon has [the yellow moon] [the yellow moon] the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's personal yellow chrysanthemum mom [Japanese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual, a family, or (more recently) an institution, municipality or business entity within Japan] in the center, with the yellow moon being darker to make the contrast between it and the chrysanthemum mom. The Great Tang Empire's unofficial naval jack, the Rì Qí [Sun Flag |Rì Qí|], a orange banner [the Rì Qí] with a red dot representing the Sun in the middle [of the Rì Qí], [the Rì Qí ]is [the Rì Qí] combined [the Rì Qí] with Yamato's and later Japan's civil banner, the Hinomaru [Ball of Sun |Hinomaru|], a white banner [the Hinomaru] with a red dot [representing the Sun] in the middle [of the Hinomaru] to form a new flag in the form of a orange banner with a white dot in the center [of the new flag] and a smaller red dot [in the center of the white dot]. This version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region eventually becomes seen as a separate state from China by the people of Asia and Eurasia, although it still tries to keep the Silk Road open and dominate Asian trade. The bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu's more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun's more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun and nominally to the emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], the collection of various powers that supported the shogunates and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, and their subordinates is [the bakufu] still [the bakufu] established in 1192 in Japan however but the position of sei-i taishōgun is [the position of sei-i taishōgun in this timeline] combined with the position of Caliph inherited from the reigning members of the Imperial House of Li ruling over the Great Tang Empire in this timeline due to the influence of the Great Tang Empire on this version of Japan The integration of Tang industrial, military and trading efforts with what was taken from the Byzantines and Persia with indigenous Japanese skill and technology leads to the early development of firearms by the version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region. Japan sends both soldiers and military aid to both the Byzantines and the Muslims fighting against the Western European crusaders, learning both Byzantine, Western European and Arab Muslim technology and military tactics which are brought back to Japan to develop it [Japan] further. During the sack of the Eastern Roman Empire's capital of Constantinople in 12–15 April 1204 by the Crusaders, which lead to the temporary disintegration of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire's ruling imperial family, the Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine, instead take direct control of the Crusader controlled Eastern Roman successor state of the Latin Empire, [the Hapsburgs] ruling the Latin Empire and the Holy Roman Empire as a dual monarchy. The Eastern Romans never recover their empire unlike in OTL and according to myths later passed down in Japan in this timeline, the last Eastern Roman Emperor in this timeline, Alexios V Doukas, gave the position of Roman Emperor to the Japanese Emperors and stated that Japan in this timeline was the true heir of Rome to a Japanese military delegation helping the Eastern Romans fighting the crusaders. The Japanese do help refugees and military units from Eastern Rome to escape to Japan from the crusaders with the help of the Arabs and the Tang's old friend, the Persians, further strengthening Japan's already immense military and economic power. The Japanese also get the Eastern Roman Empire's secret weapon of \\"Greek fire\\", a incendiary chemical weapon [Greek Fire] made from petroleum manufactured in and used by the Eastern Roman Empire from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries When the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, both [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] attempt [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] to [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] invade Japan from 1274 and 1281, the invasion [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] still [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] fail, but Japan is [Japan] able to [Japan] hold onto Korea unlike OTL. Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline's version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire's home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan's reigning heads'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang's founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen's more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire's combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC's political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen's other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people's needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China's peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China's peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China's peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai's daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry's] era name was [Henry's era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai's daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry's] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai's reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai's] legacy and [Shikai's reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen's chosen successor and heir of his [Wen's] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen's other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen's] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" is [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] killed [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death. Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government's Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek's] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan's Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration's] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] due to NKVD agent Richard Sorge being [Sorge] by the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and the Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and [Sorge] quickly neutralized, with the spy ring he [Sorge] had built in Japan being [Sorge’s spy ring] mopped up without the Soviets being anywiser and the Japanese domestic and foreign intelligence organizations being reorganized in order to prevent further breaches of security, [the mopping up of the Soviet spy ring in the Japanese Empire] preventing them [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] from [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] noticing [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] domestic threats within the Japanese Empire such as the Cherry Blossom Society. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond. Brittania never conquers Japan unlike in canon Code Geass due to Japan in this timeline being [Japan in this timeline] stronger than in both real life and OTL and [Japan in this timeline] being [Japan in this timeline] the first nation [Japan in this timeline] to [Japan in this timeline] develop ICBMs and nuclear weaponry. The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units' respective cockpits in the respective units' prominent 'hump back', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass] in the 1950s but the Kempeitai manages to steal the designs and specs for the Knightmare Frames and soon all of East Asia has its own Knightmare Frames thanks to the Japanese.","output":"In this alternate reality, the Great Tang Empire, once a dominant force over Han China, finds refuge in Yamato after their forceful evacuation. The Imperial House of Li, alongside loyal elements of the Tang Army, conquers these new territories, establishing an exile government that intertwines with the local Japanese and Korean societies. This unique combination of cultures sees the propagation of secular and religious practices like Sunni Islam and various East Asian traditions across Yamato, modern Nihon. Advanced technology from across the old world accelerates industrialization, with the discovery of Sakuradite bolstering the empire's might. The Tang government maintains connections with its historical territories through the establishment of the Later Tang dynasty as an extension of their rule, albeit from a distance. As time progresses, the Tang dynasty in exile redefines its identity, cutting ties with the China region and asserting its divine right to rule independently, blending the traditions of emperors and sultans under the banner of the Heavenly Mandate. Over generations, the Houses of Li and Great Yamato intertwine through marriage and adoption, merging cultures, languages, and traditions. The official languages of the Tang exiles promote the prestige of Eurasian lingua franca while inadvertently influencing the development of Japanese and Korean. Sunni Islam, alongside Daoist, Manchurian, and Mongolian shamanistic practices, begin to intertwine with local Shinto and Buddhist traditions, creating a unique religious fabric that permeates society. The military symbols of the Great Tang Empire and Yamato evolve into new national flags, representing the fusion of cultures under a single identity. The Bakufu system of governance is adapted, retaining its military roots while also incorporating Islamic administrative practices through the integration of the Caliph title with the Shogunate, symbolizing the amalgamation of military and divine rule. The intervention in global affairs, particularly the assistance to the Byzantines and engagement with the Mongolian invasions, showcases the military prowess and strategic depth of this new empire. Through these conflicts and alliances, Japan assimilates a wealth of knowledge, incorporating Greek fire and adopting rocket technology, further solidifying its status as a formidable power. The Ming dynasty and Japan enter a prolonged Cold War, competing for dominance over trade routes and cultural influence in Asia. This rivalry extends to the Qing dynasty, with both powers striving for supremacy through modernization and strategic expansion, including the annexation of territories and the establishment of puppet states in Korea and Taiwan. Foreign interventions and alliances shape the geopolitical landscape, with the Japanese empire taking an active role in supporting various factions during critical moments in history. The assassination of key figures and strategic marriages influence the direction of entire nations, redefining borders and allegiances across the continent. As the modern era unfolds, Japan, along with its associated states and territories, thrives as a unique amalgam of traditions, religious practices, and technological advancements. The restoration and transformation of governance, alongside strategic military and diplomatic maneuvers, position Japan as a leading power on the global stage, challenging conventional narratives of East Asian history and reshaping the balance of power through innovation and cultural synthesis. This alternate history presents a world where the fusion of distinct dynasties, cultures, and technological advancements creates a powerful and diverse empire that influences the course of world history, forever altering the fabric of East Asian society and its role in global affairs."},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

intresting, plausible, historically accurate realistic, year by year, timeline for an alternate history scenario for an fanfic of the Code Geass anime, manga, video game, light novel, visual novel and radio drama series with no references to the real world, OTL, or even to the fact that this is an alternate history scenario at all in which the post-618, pre-907, Mongolian and Manchurian dominated Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled absolute imperial dynastic monarchy/Sinicized Islamic sultante/Turko-Mongol Khanate of the Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" ruling [the Great Tang Empire] over [the Great Tang Empire's territories] Han China from [the Great Tang Empire's stronghold] East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [the Great Tang Empire in this alternate history scenario] escapes from the China region after its [the Great Tang Empire's] collapse, or more specifically the government of the Great Tang Empire is forcefully brought out of China by Han Chinese loyalists and supporters along with the Great Tang Empire's imperial family [the Imperial House of Li] with loyal elements of the Great Tang Empire's combined ground combat force and naval warfare force, the Great Tang Army, to the distant land of the supposedly Shinto pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled absolute imperial dynastic parliamentary royal monarchy of Yamato ruling [Yamato] over [the territories Yamato ruled over] the Nihon Hondo [the Japanese Home Islands |Nihon Hondo|] and Reantion [Korea |Reantion|], [the Great Tang Empire's government and |the Great Tang Empire's| imperial family |the Imperial House of Li| being brought to Yamato by Han Chinese loyalists and loyal elements of the Great Tang Army] subsequently conquering it [Yamato] and [the Tang exiles after |the Tang exiles| conquering Yamato] declaring a government in exile [of the Great Tang Empire] and [the Tang exiles after |the Tang exiles| conquering Yamato and establishing a Tang government in exile] utilize advanced technologies from Persia, Manchuria and Han China along with those brought over from the post-330 AD, pre-1453 Roman rump state of the absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy of the Eastern Roman Empire/\\"Byzantine Empire\\" ruling [the Byzantine Empire] over Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, the Balkans and the Caucuses in order to fund a primitive minature industrial revolution in their [the Tang exile's] new stronghold [Tang-conquered Yamato] while [the Tang exiles] also [the Tang exiles] trying to [what the Tang exiles try to do] spread Sunni Islam and Manchurian, Mongolian and Hui and Han Chinese culture among their [the Tang exiles'] subjects [the native ethnic Japanese people of the Japanese Home Islands and the native ethnic Koreans of the Korean peninsula along with the Japanese in Korea] which is somewhat successful. The Tang exiles also discover the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] among Yamato's geographical resources, [the Tang exiles] using it [the Sakuradite] to boost their [the Tang exile's] industrial, economic and military strength. Due to the rightful Chinese imperial government [the Great Tang Empire] being in exile [the Great Tang Empire] in Yamato, the Great Tang Empire's successor state of the pre-923 AD, post-937 successor state of the Later Tang ruling [the Later Tang] over much of Northern Han China is [the Later Tang in this scenario] simply an extension of the Tang government in exile in Yamato with ethnic Japanese and Korean soldiers from the conquered Yamato and Han Chinese, Hui, Mongolian and Manchurian soldiers of the Great Tang Army serving together against the Later Tang and the Great Tang Empire's enemies and the Great Tang Army utilizing Japanese and Korean war strategies against the warlords fighting in the China region. In defiance of the establishment of the post-960, pre-1279 Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Empire of the Great Song/Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" ruling [the Great Song State] over Han China, the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato decides to break off all ties with its [the Great Tang Empire's] home state [the China region] and [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declares itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] a separate state from the various dynasties ruling over the China region from Mongolia and Manchuria in its [the China region's] three thousand year history, [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declaring itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] to [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] have the eternal mandate of heaven combined with the ruling members of the Imperial House of Li's status as both Emperors of the Great Tang State and Sultans and Caliphs of the Great Tang Empire as a Sunni Islamic Sultanate [Great Tang Empire] under Sharia Law by divine right and birthright. Thus the evolution of Yamato into the modern nation-state known today as Nihon/Nippon [Land of the Rising Sun |Nihon/Nippon|] still continues like in OTL, albiet for a different reason. The ruling members of the Imperial House of Li and the Imperial House of Great Yamato become intertwined by concubinage, multiple marriages and adoptions to the point where the two houses become one, with similar events happening between the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty and the native Japanese and Korean nobility, aristocracy and nobility. The Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty still speak, write and think in Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish, believing these languages [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] to be the civilized tongues [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] of North Asia and Eurasia and viewing the Yue [Cantonese |Yue|] language spoken by Guangdong and Guangxi's native Cantonese people to be a barbarian tongue [Yue], and [Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty] promote the spread of these languages, especially Traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Manchu, among the people of Yamato, even though most of the ethnically Japanese and Korean native people of Yamato continue speaking and writing in Japanese and Korean The development of modern Japanese and Korean is heavily affected by these efforts by the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty however Japan's indigenous state religion, Shinto, becomes heavily influenced by the version of Sunni Islam practiced in the Tang Empire along with Han Chinese Daoist customs and Manchurian and Mongolian Shamanism. The development of Japanese Buddhism is also affected by the assimilation of the Tang exiles into Yamato as well. The Great Tang Empire's military flag, the San Chen, a red banner [the San Chen] with a large blue circle representing the Sun with [what the Blue Circle has] black rays in its [the San Chen's] center, with a smaller yellow circle representing the moon in the extreme left [of the black-rayed blue sun in the San Chen's center] is [the San Chen] combined with Yamato's and later Japan's shared naval jack and war banner of the Kyokujitsu-ki [Rising Sun Flag |Kyokujitsu-ki|] a white banner [the Kyokujitsu-ki] with [what the Kyokujitsu-ki has] a red disc representing the sun in its [the Kyokujitsu-ki's] center and sixteen red rays emanating from the disc [in the Kyokujitsu-ki's center], to form a new flag with the San Chen's black rayed sun with a yellow moon in the center of the Kyokujitsu-ki, although the yellow moon has [the yellow moon] [the yellow moon] the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's personal yellow chrysanthemum mom [Japanese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual, a family, or (more recently) an institution, municipality or business entity within Japan] in the center, with the yellow moon being darker to make the contrast between it and the chrysanthemum mom. The Great Tang Empire's unofficial naval jack, the Rì Qí [Sun Flag |Rì Qí|], a orange banner [the Rì Qí] with a red dot representing the Sun in the middle [of the Rì Qí], [the Rì Qí ]is [the Rì Qí] combined [the Rì Qí] with Yamato's and later Japan's civil banner, the Hinomaru [Ball of Sun |Hinomaru|], a white banner [the Hinomaru] with a red dot [representing the Sun] in the middle [of the Hinomaru] to form a new flag in the form of a orange banner with a white dot in the center [of the new flag] and a smaller red dot [in the center of the white dot]. This version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region eventually becomes seen as a separate state from China by the people of Asia and Eurasia, although it still tries to keep the Silk Road open and dominate Asian trade. The bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu's more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun's more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun and nominally to the emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], the collection of various powers that supported the shogunates and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, and their subordinates is [the bakufu] still [the bakufu] established in 1192 in Japan however but the position of sei-i taishōgun is [the position of sei-i taishōgun in this timeline] combined with the position of Caliph inherited from the reigning members of the Imperial House of Li ruling over the Great Tang Empire in this timeline due to the influence of the Great Tang Empire on this version of Japan The integration of Tang industrial, military and trading efforts with what was taken from the Byzantines and Persia with indigenous Japanese skill and technology leads to the early development of firearms by the version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region. Japan sends both soldiers and military aid to both the Byzantines and the Muslims fighting against the Western European crusaders, learning both Byzantine, Western European and Arab Muslim technology and military tactics which are brought back to Japan to develop it [Japan] further. During the sack of the Eastern Roman Empire's capital of Constantinople in 12–15 April 1204 by the Crusaders, which lead to the temporary disintegration of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire's ruling imperial family, the Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine, instead take direct control of the Crusader controlled Eastern Roman successor state of the Latin Empire, [the Hapsburgs] ruling the Latin Empire and the Holy Roman Empire as a dual monarchy. The Eastern Romans never recover their empire unlike in OTL and according to myths later passed down in Japan in this timeline, the last Eastern Roman Emperor in this timeline, Alexios V Doukas, gave the position of Roman Emperor to the Japanese Emperors and stated that Japan in this timeline was the true heir of Rome to a Japanese military delegation helping the Eastern Romans fighting the crusaders. The Japanese do help refugees and military units from Eastern Rome to escape to Japan from the crusaders with the help of the Arabs and the Tang's old friend, the Persians, further strengthening Japan's already immense military and economic power. The Japanese also get the Eastern Roman Empire's secret weapon of \\"Greek fire\\", a incendiary chemical weapon [Greek Fire] made from petroleum manufactured in and used by the Eastern Roman Empire from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries When the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, both [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] attempt [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] to [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] invade Japan from 1274 and 1281, the invasion [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] still [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] fail, but Japan is [Japan] able to [Japan] hold onto Korea unlike OTL. Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline's version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire's home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan's reigning heads'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang's founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen's more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire's combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC's political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen's other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people's needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China's peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China's peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China's peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai's daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry's] era name was [Henry's era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai's daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry's] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai's reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai's] legacy and [Shikai's reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen's chosen successor and heir of his [Wen's] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen's other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen's] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" is [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] killed [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death. Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government's Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek's] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan's Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day.

Fraught with internal strife and external pressures, the collapse of the empire forced the Imperial House of Li and their steadfast loyalists to seek refuge beyond their crumbling borders. The exodus led them to the land of Yamato, a realm under the dominion of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty. With a blend of tactics and technologies borrowed from the Byzantines, Persians, and their own rich heritage, the Tang exiles conquered Yamato, establishing a government in exile. This government, fueled by the discovery of the supermineral Sakuradite, embarked on a primitive industrial revolution, spreading their Islamic faith and East Asian cultures across the Japanese isles, reshaping the societal fabric. The liaison between the Imperial House of Li and the native Japanese House of Great Yamato birthed a new, intertwined aristocracy that held sway over this reborn Yamato, which continued its evolution into the modern nation-state of Nihon/Nippon. The amalgamation of both dynasties' emblems produced new symbols of unity that represented this unique blend of cultures, traditions, and governance. As centuries unfolded, the Tang-influenced Yamato exerted its influence over Asia, leading to intricate relationships with neighboring states. The restoration of the Ming dynasty in China, through the Empire of China, marked a period of cold rivalry with Nihon, each vying for dominance in Asia. This rivalry, however, was tempered by shared interests and the emergence of external threats that occasionally forced alliances of convenience. The technological prowess of Nihon, enhanced by Sakuradite, saw advancements in military and industrial capacities that were unparalleled, leading them to aid distant allies and influencing global affairs indirectly. The sojourn of displaced Eastern Roman elements to Nihon brought with it the incendiary weapon \\"Greek fire\\", further bolstering Nihon's military might. Nihon's stoic resistance against invasions, first from the Mongol Empire and later from the Great Yuan, solidified its reputation as an impregnable fortress isle, fostering a sense of unity and national pride that propelled technological and military innovations. As the Ming and later the Qing dynasties rose and fell in China, Nihon navigated the tumultuous waters of international diplomacy, sometimes clashing with, sometimes supporting the various Chinese regimes in a perpetual dance of power politics that defined North Asia. The advent of the Meiji Restoration in Nihon brought with it a blend of tradition and modernity, allowing for a balanced governance model that saw the coexistence of the Emperor's authority with a bureaucratic system led by the Shogunate, adapted to fit the modern era's demands. The unique trajectory of Nihon's development, influenced profoundly by its inception as a Tang exile state, positioned it as a pivotal player on the world stage, serving as a bridge between the old world traditions of Asia and the emerging new world order marked by industrialization, modernization, and global interconnectedness. This alternate timeline witnessed a world where the fabric of history was woven with threads of what if, showcasing a realm where the legacy of the Great Tang Empire lived on through its descendants in Nihon, a powerhouse that charted its course through the annals of an alternate history, navigating the complex dynamics of power, culture, and innovation."},{"instruction":"Qu’est-ce qui pousse un homme te marier","output":"Il existe de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles un homme pourrait choisir de se marier.

Furthermore, insofar as Europeannation-states have continuously been urbanized over the last several decades, they have rapidly beenmetropolitanized, reinforcing pervasive and profound rescaling processes of decentralization and recentralization(Loughlin & Antunes, 2019), as the norm rather than an exception or anomaly, by which city-regional citizenship canno longer be envisaged as a homogeneous status exclusively bestowed by the nation-state. As such, city-regional cit-izenship is an essential constitutive dimension of the constitutional architecture of the nation-state (even contestingit) and is, consequently, demos-defining (Arrighi & Stjepanovic, 2019; Bollens, 2007).Upon agreeing to the principle of fixed territorial integrity and sovereignty in the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia,Europe invented the nation-state (Jordana, Keating, Marx, & Wouters, 2019). Tracing the beginning of“stateless-ness”to the decline of the nation-state (Ohmae, 1995), Arendt (1949) distinguished between nations and states. Anationreferred to a dominant group living in a bounded territory and sharing a culture, language, and history,whereas astatereferred to the legal status of the people living in a territory who are considered citizens with legalrights. Since the origin of the modern nation-state, there has been structural tension between the nation and thestate regarding which people are the“true”members of a nation—whether certain people living in a territory countas citizens with legal rights or are excluded and ignored as non-citizens (Marsili & Milanese, 2018). Arendt inferredthat no effective international or state mechanism existed to protect the rights of“stateless citizens”(Bernstein,2018). Arendt's observation resonates with the current European, metropolitanized, civic, stateless, and emancipa-tory city-regionalized nationalistic pattern (Calzada, 2018b) and, particularly in this paper, with the case of Catalonia,where, since 2010, a remarkable majority of Catalan citizens' self-determination-consistent demands have not beenaccommodated thus far as a form of a properly framed“democratic politics”(Keating, 2019, p. 8) by examiningpotential and varied mechanisms to exercise the“right to decide”in Spain (Guibernau, 2013a; Centre d'Estudisd'Opinió, 2019). As such, the Spanish nation-state was established as a fixed, indissoluble, and homogeneous entitywith uniform attributes—particularly a set of fiercely enforced nation-state monopolies (e.g., defence and law) thatgave the government substantial control over the national destiny—and a narrow sense of citizenship, understood asthe legal bond between an individual and a state, that are familiar to us today. However, as Arendt anticipated, whatare then the implications of rescaling processes for city-regionalized and stateless citizens and their“right to vote”inthe current Catalonia (Kraus & Vergés, 2017; Piccoli, 2019; Stjepanovic & Tierney, 2019)?The literature on rescaling nation-states has explained that the fragmentation of the scale of the nation-state hasundermined the privileged position of the nation-state as the natural platform (Archer, 2012; Keating, 2013;Mykhnenko & Wolff, 2018). In turn, rescaling has allowed for the emergence of new forms of city-regionalized“stateless citizenship,”which is further invigorated, beyond other factors, by the limitations created by Spain thatrefrain the metropolitan hub of Barcelona in its global role (Jordana, 2019), where a“right to decide”has continu-ously been claimed (Crameri, 2015, 2016; Davidson, 2016; Generalitat de Catalunya, 2017; Guibernau, 2013b) andwhere“stateless citizenship”has manifested in grassroots demonstrations demanding a referendum on the futureform of a city-regionalized nation of Catalonia in reference to Spain and the European Union (EU) (Wydra, 2018).Paradoxically, the old European nation-state is apparently dying, but new states seem unable to be born under thesecircumstances (Bianchini, 2017; Calzada, 2015; Hepburn, 2008; Moisio, 2018; Scott, 1998). According to Jordana(2019), this gradual political reaction stemming from a perception founded on territorial abandonment by Madrid,provoking an emotional detachment with Spain, has forced the Spanish government to react (by any means)—even ifonly in terms of a determined refusal to grant any legitimacy or voice in support of secession. As a result, this paperargues that the Spanish nation-state is gradually being rescaled by Catalonia's“secession crisis”(Rodríguez López,Harguindéguy, & Sánchez Sánchez, 2019).CALZADA806This paper examines the nature and evolution of this“secession crisis”from two intertwining perspectives: (i)how the Spanish nation-state has been rescaled by this crisis since the Constitutional Court banned the Statute ofAutonomy in 2010 in a dispute that reflects the struggle between legal and democratic legitimacy and, as a result; (ii)how the metropolitan hub of Barcelona is increasingly shaping and invigorating this“secession crisis”by placing the“right to decide”(Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2019a), rather than secession itself (regardless of the outcome of ahighly unlikely referendum on independence), at the front of this debate. In the wake of the 2,286,217 Catalan citi-zens (43.03% of the Catalan census for this vote) who attempted to vote in the“illegal”referendum on 1 October2017, this paper presents two aims: first, to describe the complex context of the detachment by“stateless citizens”in light of the factual and combined data stemming from several sources. The second aim is to shed light on the fol-lowing main research question: is it feasible to accommodate the claims of Catalonia's“stateless citizenship”as away out of this“secession crisis”? (Moreno, Colino, & Hombrado, 2019; Stjepanovic & Tierney, 2019).This paper considers that this crisis in the Spanish nation-state has progressed to the point that it has become a“secession crisis”(Bartkus, 1999), provoking emotional detachment among a remarkable portion of Catalan citizenswho broadly represent various forms and attitudes and whom this paper defines as“stateless citizens”in Cataloniaas of 2010.“Stateless citizens”represent, as Jordana (2019) suggests, a singular and heterogeneous coalition of city-regional citizens in Catalonia who have been demonstrating regularly since 2010 (i) while being ignored by the Span-ish government; (ii) which has provoked their socio-political and metropolitan counter-reaction that is geopoliticallyfocused on Barcelona in pursuit of accommodating their further autonomy demands and the international project ofusing the global city by imagining a currentlyinexistentfederal or independent state in Europe as way out of the sta-tus quo and/or the increasing recentralization strategyin their existingSpanish nation-state. This singular coalition,essentially blending civic nationalism and secessionism, remains highly united due to three factors (Bollens, 2007;Jordana, 2019): (i) the perception of a unity from which all parties benefit; (ii) the shared self-perception of a coalitionwith regard to the attractiveness of a global city such as Barcelona; and (iii) a strong balance among political partiesand grassroots movements with heterogeneous political orientations but a common aim. These three factors lead usto conceive of“stateless citizens”as neither a purely nationalistic movement (despite strong civic features) nor amovement exclusively based on identity. Instead,“stateless citizenship”is considered a geopolitical and a city-regional civilian response that is spreading through the metropolitan hub of Barcelona while being driven by theglobal city through its support of the“right to decide”as a way to internationalize the self-determination“right tothe city”in a hyper-globalized and multipolar realm (Fukuyama, 2018; Smith, 2019; Tamir, 2019).“Stateless citizenship”is operationally defined (using factual evidence and empirical data in tables and figures andoperationalizing the main research question throughout the paper, as depicted in Table 1) as those Catalan citizenswho are somehow randomly represented by these (not mutually exclusive) six ongoing contextual factors that arecharacterized by a complex metropolitan driver and a political claim in the awake of the Catalan grassroots secessiondecision on 10 July 2010 in Barcelona: (i) 62% of Catalan citizens believe that Catalonia deserves to develop alterna-tive accommodation mechanisms such as either an independent state or a state in federal Spain (according to the 1stwave of March 2019; Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 1); (ii) 65% of Catalan citizens are willing to furtherexplore ways to increase devolution in Catalonia (Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 2); (iii) 48% of Catalan citi-zens demonstrate widespread social support for independence through their continuous active participation in grass-roots demonstrations since 2010 (Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 3); (iv) 2,286,217 Catalan citizensattempted to vote on the“illegal”and“constitutive referendum”on 1 October 2017 (Generalitat de Catalunya,2019) (Table 2); (v) Catalan citizens voted for political parties favourable to the“right to decide”(which is understoodas the right to vote in a referendum) with representation in the regional and local elections (61% of the MPs in Bar-celona City Council's Parliament after local elections on 26 May 2019 and 58% of the MPs in the Parliament of Cata-lonia after regional elections on 21 December 2017) (Figure 4); and ultimately, (vi) 78.7% of Catalan citizens agreethat Catalans have the“right to decide”their own future as a country/nation voting in a referendum (Centred'Estudis d'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 5). The data and evidence presented in this article corresponds to the evolutionCALZADA807until the 1st Wave 2019 (March 2019; Centre d'Estudis de'Opinio, 2019) published by the d'Estudis d'Opinió afterthe fieldwork that was carried out by Gabinet d'Estudis Socials i Opinió Pública (GESOP), SL, from 4 to 25 March2019.This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the rationale by which rescaling has been invigorated since2010, which is manifested by the“right to decide”grassroots demonstrations and backed by an increasing politicalattitude demanding the exercise of consultation on the matter of secession. Section 3 highlights the metropolitannature of Barcelona alongside its global city role in this“secession crisis.”Section 4 concludes that, at present, withthe analysed factors in this paper, it is hardly feasible for the Spanish nation-state to accommodate Catalonia's“stateless citizenship.”2|RATIONALE: THE“RIGHT TO DECIDE”DEBATE AS THE UPDATEDVERSION OF THE“RIGHT TO THE CITY”IN SECESSIONISMAccording to Keating (2013, p. 6), nation-state rescaling can be defined as the“migration of economic, social, andpolitical systems of action and of regulation to new spatial levels above, below, and across the nation-state.”Theforms and functions of the nation-state have been displaced upwards (to supranational bodies), downwards (toregional, metropolitan, and urban bodies) and sideways (to non-state agencies). As the mutual correspondence of thestate, the governing order, the economy, society, and identity can no longer be taken for granted, in this paper, ITABLE 1Operationalizing the main research question: Is it feasible to accommodate Catalan“StatelessCitizenship”in the Spanish nation-state?FactorsMetricsFactual evidences and empirical data(1) Political Opinion on:Accommodation,Devolution, andSecession (Source:Centre d'Estudisd'Opinió, 2019)Potential accommodationmechanisms in relation to Spain1.1.

In the case of Catalonia, a stress on the rights of the individual—instead of traditionalethnic nationalistic features—has always appeared in the slogans circulating on social media (Arrighi &Stjepanovic, 2019; Crameri, 2016) regarding the Catalan National Assembly (Assemblea Nacional Catalana,ANC;www.assemblea.cat) andÓmnium Cultural(OC; www.omnium.cat) civil pro-independence movements. Thus,“stateless citizenship”in Catalonia is phrased as a desire for independence (or feasible federal accommodations)stemming from the right of the moral autonomy of the individual, which not only downplays group membershipbut also reinforces the argument that each Catalan citizen should have the democratic right to peacefully vote onthe way forward.Hence, the metropolitan root of the political expression of the“right to decide”can be viewed as a new versionof a metropolitan-based“right to the city”beyond nation-states. Thus, ademos-driven, self-determination 2.0 versionempowered by a wide range of political ideologies around a“civic nationalist”peaceful movement activates a bot-tom-up and progressivist city-regional political response in Catalonia (Keating, 2019). The push for the“right todecide”in Catalonia cannot entirely be explained without the metropolitan hub of Barcelona and its pursuit of anexplicit and self-conscious sense of metropolitan belonging that renews the idea of the“right to the city”(Harvey,2008; Lefebvre, 1968). In this interpretation (Calzada, 2018b), the civic quest for political-democratic ownership ofthe metropolis is extended to“stateless citizenship.”Moreover, rescaling has caused new social and political cleavages between subnational levels in the Spanishnation-state based on the metropolitan push by secessionist social movements operating simultaneously by over-lapping at a number of different scales (urban, metropolitan, and city-regional) (Bauböck, 2019; Calzada, 2017). Con-sequently, a city-regionalized“stateless citizenship”has been fuelled by“civic nationalism”rooted in themetropolitan“right to decide”(as an updated version of the principle of the“right to the city”) and bolstered by themetropolitan hub of Barcelona through an increasing push by grassroots movements such as the ANC and OC. How-ever, before the ongoing re-emergence period of Catalan secessionism, authors such as Miley (2007) advocatedagainst the thesis of Catalonia as a“civic nation.”As Miley stated, as a counterargument to the previous trend—andin opposition to exercising the“right to decide”through referendum and consultation so as to defend fixed state-ter-ritorial integrity stemming from the Westphalian order of the club of nation-states and from the principle of the“empire of law”—state-centric“ethnic nationalistic”expressions with different rationales have recently (re-)emergedand are embodied by the liberal, conservative, and far-right Spanish political parties: the Citizens' Party (Ciudadanos,the Cs), the Popular Party (Partido Popular,PP), andVox(Billig, 1995).Against this backdrop, in Catalonia, the regimes of self-government and devolution accommodation providedby Spain continue to be perceived as insufficient by a large share of Catalan (and Barcelonese) society (Figure 2),resulting in further tensions among territorial statehood, the spaces of historical identity, and future secessionistaspirations (Mulle & Serrano, 2018; Rodríguez López et al., 2019). One means by which Spain can relieve this ten-sion is to seek outright independence to reconcile the spaces of identity and statehood of Catalonia's small city-regionalized nation through referenda, as occurred in Scotland in 2014 (Arrighi, 2019; Qvortrup, 2014). Never-theless, Cetrà and Harvey (2018, p. 1) predicted that“independence referendums will continue to be rareevents.”The hypothesis of this paper focuses on the link among civic nationalism, secessionism, and the emancipatoryrole of cities (and city-regions) through the claims of the“right to decide”, as noted by Berlin (1996, p. 252), whostated that“nationalism springs, as often as not, from a wounded or outraged sense of human dignity, the desire ofrecognition.”Moreover, Guibernau (2013a, p. 411) defines the“right to decide”as“the right by citizens of the nationto defend and exercise, through referenda and consultation, their right to be recognized as ademosable to decideupon their political destiny triggered by their desire to share a common fate.”This paper depicts the evolution ofsecessionism in Catalonia and Barcelona, which complement each other and are characterized by a demand made byCALZADA810considerable portions of the Catalan and Barcelonese populations to hold a referendum and, according to recentdata in March 2019, favour secession (Keating, 2019; Tamir, 2019). According to Figure 3, judging from the evolutionsince March 2015 until March 2019, the disparity over the time among those in favour of and against to the idea of“Catalonia becoming an independent State”is higher in Barcelona than in Catalonia, which suggests that gaining orlacking metropolitan support will establish the future directions of devolution debates (Calzada, 2018b). However, itremains to be seen: (i) whether it is feasible to accommodate a referendum claim and effective secession through therealization of an independent state in the EU (or at least a federal state in Spain) (Guinjoan & Rodon, 2016; Jordanaet al., 2019; Rico, 2016); or (ii) whether there is room for another type of experimental and federal pathway inEurope, as long as citizens' geodemocratic rights to remain in the former nation-state or to secede are ensured (Cal-zada, 2018a).FIGURE 2Factor“political opinion on devolution”and the metric of favourable/unfavourable towards further“devolution”(1.2)Source:Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió (2019) (Q32)CALZADA8113|DISCUSSION: IS IT FEASIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE CATALAN“STATELESS CITIZENSHIP”IN THE SPANISH NATION-STATE?Despite being located at the geographic periphery, according to the centralistic mindset of Madrid's elites (Ehrlich,1997), Catalonia has often held a central position in Spanish politics. According to Jordana, since the nineteenth cen-tury, Barcelona has been one of the most advanced and modern cities in Spain (Jordana, 2019; Jordana et al., 2019).This modernity stemmed from the success of the broad“Catalanist”movement, which, over time, has almost alwayssimultaneously housed autonomists, federalists, confederalists, and pro-independentists but, in recent years, hastransitioned collectively (despite not hegemonically) towards a singular and heterogeneous coalition in favour of the“right to decide”(Guibernau, 2013b). This historical goal of mainstream“Catalanism”consisted of securing accommo-dations within Spain combined with direct participation in the EU. However, this accommodation has resulted in anunstable equilibrium: since 2010, this increasing support for the“right to decide,”rather than secession itself, hasbecome sufficiently widespread to force the Spanish government to fiercely react to Catalan demands in terms of afixed position rooted in constitutional legality.Although the starting point of Catalan grassroots mobilization could be situated in 2010, the first milestonemust be located in 2006: The updated Catalan Statute of Autonomy came into force and was approved in theFIGURE 3Factor“political opinion on secession”and the metric of favourable/unfavourable towards“secession”(1.3)Source: Centre d'Estudis d'Opinió (2019) (Q34)CALZADA812Catalan and Spanish Parliaments and by a referendum in Catalonia. However, the turnout for this approval failedto reach 50%, indicating public apathy towards the statute and reflecting the top-down nature of the reform pro-cess itself. Furthermore, in June 2010, the Constitutional Court declared several articles of the statute regardingthe consideration of Catalonia as a nation to be unconstitutional. This decision set Catalonia onto the pathway ofsecessionist politics: One month later, on 10 July 2010, as a socio-political and metropolitan reaction to this legaldecision, a massive demonstration in Barcelona took place under the motto“We are a nation, we decide.”Consol-idating this trend, on Catalonia's national holiday on 11 September 2012, another demonstration in Barcelonaorganized by OC took place; using the explicit motto“Catalonia, a new state in Europe,”this demonstration mar-ked the symbolic beginning of the independence referendum campaign, which continues to this day (Colomer,2017; Cuadras-Morató, 2016). The 1.5 million citizens who demonstrated in Barcelona in favour of self-determi-nation on 11 September 2012—and on many occasions thereafter—illustrate the strength of the civic/metropolitanized nationalistic movement that favours dissolving the concept of a singledemosby overcoming theethnic nature of citizenship, thus blending Spanish and Catalan identities with the opportunity to democraticallyvote in favour of or against independence. In contrast, the accommodation of such democratic claims directlychallenges the position of a large majority of Spanish public opinion by depicting a clear asymmetric perceptionbetween the Spanish and the Catalonian as well as the political class in the Spanish central government, whoinsist that the constitutional provisions supporting centralism are non-negotiable. Moreover, stressing this coun-ter-reaction to the Catalan“secession crisis,”on 12 February 2019, the long-awaited trial of twelve Catalan sepa-ratist leaders subject to up to 25 years of imprisonment on charges of rebellion andmisuse of public funds fortheir role in the“illegal”referendum that took place on 1 October 2017 began in the Spanish Supreme Court. Par-alleling this long process, the emergent far-rightin Spain (Billig, 1995), embodied by the new partyVox,hascapi-talized on the secessionist backlash byre-introducing Franco-era discourses and analogies to the Spanish nation-state and achieving representation in the Spanish parliament for the first time, which is likely to even furtheraccelerate the inner systemic conflict by exacerbating the rescaling process in Spain.To briefly summarize the socio-political unrest and the civilian mobilization in response to it, Barcelona witnessedfour main milestones as the principal strategic steps in the long Catalan secession process (Harguindéguy, SolaRodríguez, & Cruz Díaz, 2018): (i) on 9 November 2014, a non-binding self-determination referendum was organized;(ii) on 27 September 2015, a plebiscitary election with a unity list in favour of“yes”was announced yet did notobtain a majority of votes but did obtain a majority of MP seats (Martí & Cetrà, 2016); (iii) on 1 October 2017, the“illegal”and“constitutive referendum”was held; and (iv) on 27 October 2017, a unilateral and“symbolic”declarationof independence took place (Cetrá, Casanas-Adam, & Tárrega, 2018).In Barcelona, the claim for independence has continued since the Statute of Autonomy was first approved by theCatalan regional parliament in 2006, which was later rejected by the Constitutional Court in what was interpreted asan act of aggression not only by the main Catalan nationalistic parties but also by proponents of other federalist (notlikely to be in favour of full independence) options merely demanding respect for the sovereignty of the Catalan par-liament and a say in the future of the city-region.As the highpoint of this process, on 1 October 2017, the referendum on Catalan independence prompted scenesof police violence that were broadcast all over the world and that were followed by the declaration of independenceby the Catalan regional government, which has been the turning point not only for politics in Catalonia but also forthe balance of power among Spanish political parties and, more broadly, the internationalization of this political con-flict rooted in secessionism and claims for devolution through the“right to decide”(Table 2). However, this paperargues that this case is about more than Catalonia itself. The events taking place reflect a battle between two ver-sions of Spain, and the competition between them appeared to have been resolved during the transition from dicta-torship to democracy in the late 1970s. Therefore, as many Spaniards had long suspected, it turns out that thememories of the Civil War of 1936 to 1939 have not been laid to rest. According to Figures 1 and 2, despite the factthat there are other options besides independence and recentralization, the evolution in both Catalonia and the met-ropolitan province of Barcelona shows a willingness to achieve further autonomy through the“right to decide.”CALZADA813Furthermore, the local (26 May 2019), general (28 April 2019), and regional election (21 December 2017) resultshave shown that Catalonia and Barcelona are not particularly aligned with the Spanish nationalistic view representedby PP, Cs, as well as the far-rightVox(Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2019b). Actually, consistently, 61%, 58%, and 60%of the representatives, elected through the respective elections (local, regional, and general), favour the“right todecide.”The cause of Catalan independence could be viewed as the catalyst for the recent upheavals, not as theunderlying reason for the re-emergence of the most extreme version of ethnic state-centric nationalistic expressionembodied by the new far-right partyVox(Billig, 1995).Consequently, this paper argues that the claim for the“right to decide”in Barcelona and, by extension, inCatalonia, has been consistent since 10 July 2010, due to official support continuously being manifestedthrough regional and city council parliamentary elections as well as the crowded grassroots demonstrations reg-ularly occurring in the metropolitan province of Barcelona. Of course, self-determination does not necessarilymean secession; it simply means being able to decide whether to secede (Stjepanovic, 2018). The newly electedradical-left mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau (BComú), appears cautiously ambivalent in confronting this debate,while Barcelona remains trapped in the city-regional/metropolitan territory. Colau openly supports the popularreferendum to implement the“right to decide”while also taking no clear position on Catalan independence.And in line with this and in contrast to widespread perceptions, the majority of the current Catalan regionalparliament (58% of MPs) and the majority of the city council parliament in Barcelona (61% of representatives)favour the exercise of the“right to decide”(Calzada, 2018b) (Figure 4). For most Catalans, regardless ofwhether they favour independence, the principle that they should be able to vote on their status vis-à-vis Spainhas become the embodiment of the meaning of democracy in the current“secession crisis”(Crameri, 2015). Tofurther illustrate this support, a platform called www.somel80.cat (“We Are the 80% Platform”) has recentlybeen set up to point out that the majority of the residents of Catalonia (78.7%, according to the latest Baròme-ter published result in March 2019; Figure 5) enjoy a high level of agreement regarding: (i) the defence ofessential democratic rights and freedoms; (ii) the rejection of repression and the use of the criminal justice sys-tem as a tool to resolve political conflicts; and (iii) the defence of a political solution that must always allowthe residents of Catalonia to decide and democratically determine their political future. Therefore, the platformadvocates the“right to decide”for the majority of the Catalan society that could be represented in terms ofnon-recognized“stateless citizenship”in the EU. Despite legal considerations, as Arendt anticipated, the rightsof 2,286,217 Catalan“stateless citizens”in the EU who voted in the“illegal”referendum on 1 October 2017may not presently be protected or recognized. Unsurprisingly, through civil movements and protests, the Cata-lan republican movement has spurred a transformation of the sense of the metropolitan“right to the city”intothe sense of belonging to civic republican and nationalistic conceptions of democracy in which democracy isconceived of as a participatory, inclusive, and deliberative form of government in line with EU values.TABLE 2Factor“direct democracy, constitutive referendum, and grassroots/social mobilization”and the metricof favourable/unfavourable towards secession (2.1.): outcome of the“illegal”and“constitutive referendum”on 1October 2017TurnoutVotesResultsCensus Voters%Validated Null YES%NO% White %Catalonia5,313,564 2,286,217 43.03 2,266,498 19,719 2,044,038 90.18 177,547 7.83 44,913 1.98MultilevelBarcelona(Bauböck,2019)Provincial3,971,666 1,637,401 41.23 1,622,139 15,262 1,438,682 88.69 147,294 9.08 36,163 2.23Metropolitan 3,605,651 1,425,607 39.54 1,411,409 14,198 1,239,232 87.80 138,759 9.83 33,418 2.37Urban1,570,607 564,321 35.93 557,930 6,391 486,131 87.13 55,477 9.94 16,322 2.93Municipal1,136,354 446,388 39.28 441,237 5,151 389,777 88.33 37,975 8.60 13,485 3.05Source:Generalitat de Catalunya (2019)CALZADA814\\"\\"","output":"Resumen Profesional: El artículo de Igor Calzada examina el complejo proceso de redimensionamiento del Estado-nación español a través del prisma de la crisis de secesión en Cataluña, especialmente después del referéndum considerado \\"ilegal\\" el 1 de octubre de 2017. Con un enfoque específico en la ciudad de Barcelona y los movimientos ciudadanos desde el 10 de julio de 2010, Calzada argumenta que, actualmente, no es viable para el Estado español acomodar la \\"ciudadanía sin estado\\" de Cataluña, un fenómeno que se intensificó tras el rechazo del Estatuto de Autonomía catalán en 2010. El análisis proporciona una visión profunda sobre cómo los desafíos escalares urbanos, regionales y nacionales están redefiniendo las nociones de ciudadanía, pertenencia, y autogobierno en el contexto europeo contemporáneo. Puntos Clave: - **Crisis de Secesión Catalana:** El artículo rastrea el desarrollo de la crisis secesionista de Cataluña desde el masivo movimiento ciudadano de julio de 2010, exacerbado por eventos significativos como el referéndum de independencia de 2017. A través de estos eventos, se revela un creciente apoyo hacia la secesión, subrayando una crisis territorial y de identidad dentro de España. - **Ciudadanía Sin Estado:** Cataluña ha experimentado un proceso de desidentificación con el concepto tradicional de la nación-estado española, buscando formas de autogobierno y definición identitaria fuera de las estructuras estatales establecidas. Estas dinámicas han llevado a un aumento en la demanda ciudadana de un \\"derecho a decidir\\", situando a Barcelona como epicentro de estos reclamos. - **Desafíos a la Escalabilidad del Estado-Nación:** La situación en Cataluña representa un desafío significativo a la escalabilidad y la soberanía del estado-nación español, planteando preguntas sobre la viabilidad de acomodar demandas de autogobierno y secesión dentro de una estructura estatal indisoluble. - **Política y Ciudadanía Metropolitana:** Barcelona, como ciudad global y metropolitana, emerge como un agente crucial en la articulación y movilización de la demanda secesionista, representando un caso destacado de cómo las escalas urbanas y metropolitanas están desempeñando roles prominentes en los movimientos secesionistas contemporáneos. - **Implicaciones Más Amplias para Europa:** El caso de Cataluña no es aislado, sino que ilustra retos más amplios a los que se enfrentan las naciones-estado en Europa, donde las reivindicaciones de autodeterminación, devolución y derechos democráticos están desafiando las nociones tradicionales de soberanía y ciudadanía. Conclusiones: El artículo concluye que, dados los profundos desafíos identitarios, políticos y escalares emergentes de Cataluña y su manifestación en Barcelona, el Estado-nación español encuentra considerables dificultades en acomodar la ciudadanía sin estado catalana bajo su estructura actual. Este análisis subraya la necesidad de repensar las relaciones entre nación, estado y ciudadanía en el contexto de las transformaciones urbanas, regionales y globales del siglo XXI."},{"instruction":"pero en que formas se ha de repensar ese encaje y mas aun cuando la constitucion es como es","output":"El desafío de repensar el encaje de Cataluña dentro del Estado español, especialmente dado el marco constitucional actual que define la indisolubilidad de la nación española, requiere un enfoque multifacético y adaptativo que atienda tanto a las demandas políticas y culturales de Cataluña como a la integridad y funcionamiento del Estado. Aquí se exploran algunas formas en las que este reajuste podría conceptualizarse: # 1. **Reforma Constitucional:** Una vía para acomodar las demandas de Cataluña sería a través de una reforma de la Constitución Española que permitiera mayor flexibilidad en la autodeterminación de las comunidades autónomas, incluyendo la posibilidad de celebrar referendos sobre cuestiones de autonomía o independencia, bajo ciertos preceptos. Esto exigiría un consenso nacional y una reflexión profunda sobre la soberanía y la unidad del Estado, también considerando los precedentes que esto podría crear. # 2. **Modelo Federal o Confederal:** Adaptar un modelo más federal o confederal que permita a Cataluña (y potencialmente a otras regiones con fuertes identidades autonómicas) una mayor autogestión y autonomía fiscal podría ser una solución. Esto implicaría redefinir las competencias estatales y autonómicas, permitiendo a regiones como Cataluña tener más control sobre sus finanzas, educación, policía, y legislaciones en ciertas áreas. # 3. **Diálogo y Negociación Política:** Es fundamental establecer un diálogo continuo y constructivo entre el gobierno central y los representantes catalanes. A través de la negociación, se podrían alcanzar acuerdos específicos que atiendan a las demandas catalanas dentro del marco constitucional existente, evitando así la unilateralidad y buscando consenso y reconocimiento mutuo. # 4. **Derecho a Decidir:** Abordar y definir concretamente el \\"derecho a decidir\\" dentro del marco legal español, posiblemente como parte de una reforma constitucional o estatutaria, podría ofrecer a Cataluña un mecanismo legal y acordado para expresar sus aspiraciones de futuro, ya sea como parte de un modelo federalizado de España o incluso en términos de independencia, bajo determinadas circunstancias y con pleno respeto al ordenamiento jurídico. # 5. **Fortalecimiento de la Identidad Cultural y Lingüística:** Además del aspecto político y legal, es vital reconocer y fortalecer la identidad cultural, lingüística y histórica catalana dentro de España, promoviendo políticas que protejan y promuevan las peculiaridades culturales de Cataluña, garantizando su difusión y enseñanza. # 6. **Participación Ciudadana Activa:** Fomentar una mayor participación ciudadana en el proceso de toma de decisiones. Esto incluye no solo referendos, sino también foros de diálogo y mecanismos de participación que permitan a los ciudadanos expresar sus opiniones y preferencias sobre el futuro político y cultural de Cataluña. # Conclusión: Una solución duradera al desafío catalán requerirá creatividad, diálogo y la voluntad de explorar territorio constitucional y legal inédito. La clave será hallar un equilibrio que preserve la cohesión y la integridad de España, al tiempo que reconozca y acomode las legítimas aspiraciones catalanas. Esto probablemente requerirá compromisos de ambas partes, así como un enfoque inclusivo y participativo que movilice la voluntad tanto de la sociedad catalana como de la española en su conjunto."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

which is somewhat successful. The Tang exiles also discover the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] among Yamato's geographical resources, [the Tang exiles] using it [the Sakuradite] to boost their [the Tang exile's] industrial, economic and military strength.

Thus the evolution of Yamato into the modern nation-state known today as Nihon/Nippon [Land of the Rising Sun |Nihon/Nippon|] still continues like in OTL, albiet for a different reason. The ruling members of the Imperial House of Li and the Imperial House of Great Yamato become intertwined by concubinage, multiple marriages and adoptions to the point where the two houses become one, with similar events happening between the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty and the native Japanese and Korean nobility, aristocracy and nobility. The Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty still speak, write and think in Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish, believing these languages [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] to be the civilized tongues [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] of North Asia and Eurasia and viewing the Yue [Cantonese |Yue|] language spoken by Guangdong and Guangxi's native Cantonese people to be a barbarian tongue [Yue], and [Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty] promote the spread of these languages, especially Traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Manchu, among the people of Yamato, even though most of the ethnically Japanese and Korean native people of Yamato continue speaking and writing in Japanese and Korean The development of modern Japanese and Korean is heavily affected by these efforts by the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty however Japan's indigenous state religion, Shinto, becomes heavily influenced by the version of Sunni Islam practiced in the Tang Empire along with Han Chinese Daoist customs and Manchurian and Mongolian Shamanism. The development of Japanese Buddhism is also affected by the assimilation of the Tang exiles into Yamato as well.

This version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region eventually becomes seen as a separate state from China by the people of Asia and Eurasia, although it still tries to keep the Silk Road open and dominate Asian trade.

Japan sends both soldiers and military aid to both the Byzantines and the Muslims fighting against the Western European crusaders, learning both Byzantine, Western European and Arab Muslim technology and military tactics which are brought back to Japan to develop it [Japan] further. During the sack of the Eastern Roman Empire's capital of Constantinople in 12–15 April 1204 by the Crusaders, which lead to the temporary disintegration of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire's ruling imperial family, the Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine, instead take direct control of the Crusader controlled Eastern Roman successor state of the Latin Empire, [the Hapsburgs] ruling the Latin Empire and the Holy Roman Empire as a dual monarchy. The Eastern Romans never recover their empire unlike in OTL and according to myths later passed down in Japan in this timeline, the last Eastern Roman Emperor in this timeline, Alexios V Doukas, gave the position of Roman Emperor to the Japanese Emperors and stated that Japan in this timeline was the true heir of Rome to a Japanese military delegation helping the Eastern Romans fighting the crusaders. The Japanese do help refugees and military units from Eastern Rome to escape to Japan from the crusaders with the help of the Arabs and the Tang's old friend, the Persians, further strengthening Japan's already immense military and economic power. The Japanese also get the Eastern Roman Empire's secret weapon of \\"Greek fire\\", a incendiary chemical weapon [Greek Fire] made from petroleum manufactured in and used by the Eastern Roman Empire from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries When the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, both [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] attempt [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] to [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] invade Japan from 1274 and 1281, the invasion [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] still [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] fail, but Japan is [Japan] able to [Japan] hold onto Korea unlike OTL. Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline's version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire's home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan's reigning heads'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang's founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen's more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire's combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC's political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen's other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people's needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China's peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China's peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China's peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai's daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry's] era name was [Henry's era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai's daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry's] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai's reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai's] legacy and [Shikai's reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen's chosen successor and heir of his [Wen's] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen's other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen's] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" is [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] killed [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen's/\\"Yat-Sen\\"'s] death. Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government's Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek's] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan's Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration's] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] due to NKVD agent Richard Sorge being [Sorge] by the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and the Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and [Sorge] quickly neutralized, with the spy ring he [Sorge] had built in Japan being [Sorge’s spy ring] mopped up without the Soviets being anywiser and the Japanese domestic and foreign intelligence organizations being reorganized in order to prevent further breaches of security, [the mopping up of the Soviet spy ring in the Japanese Empire] preventing them [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] from [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] noticing [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] domestic threats within the Japanese Empire such as the Cherry Blossom Society. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond. Brittania never conquers Japan unlike in canon Code Geass due to Japan in this timeline being [Japan in this timeline] stronger than in both real life and OTL and [Japan in this timeline] being [Japan in this timeline] the first nation [Japan in this timeline] to [Japan in this timeline] develop ICBMs and nuclear weaponry. The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units' respective cockpits in the respective units' prominent 'hump back', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass] in the 1950s but the Kempeitai manages to steal the designs and specs for the Knightmare Frames and soon all of East Asia has its own Knightmare Frames thanks to the Japanese. N.B: Everything in this timeline takes place in chronological order.","output":"In an alternate timeline, the Great Tang Empire, led by the Mongolian and Manchurian-dominated Imperial House of Li, flees to the distant lands of Yamato following its forced collapse. This monumental migration, fueled by loyal Han Chinese supporters and the remnants of the Tang Army, leads to the establishment of a unique government in exile. Recognizing the potential of the land and its resources, the Tang exiles, leveraging advanced technologies from notable regions including Persia and the remnants of the Byzantine Empire, initiate a primitive industrial revolution in Yamato. This technological infusion, along with the discovery of the highly unstable and explosive mineral Sakuradite, bolsters the Tang exile's industrial, economic, and military prowess. Amidst this transformative era, the Tang exiles embark on a cultural mission to spread Sunni Islam along with Manchurian, Mongolian, and Han Chinese customs among the natives of Yamato and Korea. In this process, deep cultural syntheses occur, profoundly influencing language, religion, and societal norms within the region. The integration of the Imperial House of Li with the native Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty through a series of marriages, concubinages, and adoptions further cements the unique cultural fusion that characterizes this era. As the Tang exiles navigate their new geopolitical landscape, they establish a distinct flag symbolic of their merged identities, combining elements of the Tang military flag, the San Chen, with the traditional Yamato naval jack, the Kyokujitsu-ki, signifying the dawn of a new era. Despite the dissolution of the Great Tang Empire, its successor state, the Later Tang ruling over Northern Han China, continues to serve as an extension of the Tang government in exile, leveraging joint military strategies from its diverse coalition against common enemies. Determined to break free from the shadows of past Chinese dynasties, the Tang government in exile proclaims its independence, declaring a renewed mandate of heaven, uniquely positioning itself as both a continuation of the Tang dynasty and an Islamic Sultanate under Sharia Law. The socio-political landscape of Yamato evolves dramatically under this influence, seeing the rise of a robust, militarized society adept in advanced technologies including firearm development, significantly influenced by external interactions, particularly with the Byzantines and the Persians. Tensions with neighboring states, such as the Later Tang, the Song dynasty, and eventually, the Mongol Empire, shape the strategic orientation of the Tang exiles, leading to significant military engagements including the failed Mongol invasions of Japan. These conflicts underscore the strategic importance of the region, transforming it into a militarized state poised for regional dominance. The emergence of the Ming dynasty as a formidable contender further intensifies the power struggle within the region, leading to a protracted Cold War characterized by fierce competition over trade, military prowess, and cultural hegemony. Amidst this turbulent landscape, the Tang exiles' legacy persists, influencing the political, cultural, and military development of the region profoundly, leading to the establishment of a state characterized by its unique synthesis of Tang and Yamato traditions, positioned as a distinct entity in the historical tapestry of East Asia."},{"instruction":"Note: This is in an alternate universe, This shop, despite being awesome, never existed, It does in this alternate universe, Also sorry for constantly showing you this, I’m just trying to make sure its perfect We’ve loved being in this spot as part of the wonderful Glasgow community Unfortunately, This shop is now closed, The realities of retail in the shopping landscape has made this decision unavoidable, We want to take the opportunity to thank you for shopping with us for so many years, You can find all about KikoRiki and its related online MMO RolyPolyLand at riki.com Goodbye forever… This sign was posted to the doors of Riki, a children’s shop in Glasgow on Wednesday The image ends with a poignant “Goodbye forever…” above a image of a crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here.

Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a convo where a user remembers for a few weeks in late June-Early July 2007 there was a generic page with a black background and a animated Flash SWF of Krash crying, with sound effects and music, Below this there were 4 logos (the 3 are the usual ones seen in Riki goodbye messages, the 4th is RolyPolyLand) This was on rikistore.co.uk, It eventually redirected to rolypolyland.com by early August","output":"Thread Title: Remembering the Riki Store Closure Online Tribute --- User1: RetroWebWanderer Hey everyone, does anyone else remember the incredibly touching online tribute the Riki Store set up on their website right after closing in June 2007? For a few weeks during late June to early July 2007, if you visited rikistore.co.uk, you were greeted with this stark black background page featuring an animated Flash SWF of Krash crying. It was surprisingly detailed, with sound effects and the sorrowful music that played in the store's final minutes. Beneath this poignant animation, there were four logos displayed. Three of these are familiar to us from the Riki goodbye messages – STV, CITV, Toonattik – but the fourth was for RolyPolyLand. It really felt like they were guiding us on where to go next, both on TV and online, to keep the memory and the magic of Riki alive. --- User2: NostalgiaNavigator Absolutely remember that! It felt like such a modern way to say goodbye at the time, leveraging the web to connect with their audience one last time. I think it also pointed towards how online spaces were becoming the new frontier for engaging with audiences, especially kids. The choice to include RolyPolyLand was particularly savvy, signaling their next big venture in a subtle way. --- User3: FlashEraFanatic That Flash animation of Krash really hit me hard. It was like watching the end of an era right before our eyes, in real-time. Flash animations had this unique charm, and to use it for such a heartfelt farewell was both brilliant and bittersweet. Plus, the sound design on the page was top-notch; it was more than just a visual goodbye - it was a deeply emotional experience. --- User4: DigitalArchivist For anyone who missed it or wants to revisit that moment, you might find archived versions of the page on the Wayback Machine. It's fascinating to see how even in their closing moments, Riki was pushing the envelope on how retail spaces communicated with their audiences online. Transitioning the page to redirect to RolyPolyLand by early August was a smart move, directly funneling that lingering interest and emotional investment into their new project. --- User5: LogoLover The inclusion of the four logos was a stroke of genius. It not only served as a signpost for where fans could continue to follow their favorite characters but also as a testament to the partnerships and networks Riki was part of. The transition from a physical store into the digital realm, symbolized by that page redirecting to RolyPolyLand, marked a significant shift in how children's entertainment was evolving. --- User6: GlasgowGamerKid I remember visiting that page after hearing the store had closed. It was a surreal experience seeing Krash cry like that; I wasn't ready for the feels trip. Kudos to whoever designed that page; it managed to encapsulate all the love and sadness of the moment perfectly. And then leading us to RolyPolyLand was like a gentle nudge saying, \\"It's not over; the adventure continues here.\\" Really showed how ahead of their time Riki was in understanding the digital landscape. ---"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up asking if it was did by Proud Creative like the closure notice, or by the shows usual animators, a former worker answers this","output":"--- User7: ProudRikiAlumni Hey @RetroWebWanderer and everyone in this thread, it's heartwarming to see the Riki Store remembered with such fondness. To answer the question about who created the touching Flash SWF of Krash crying on the goodbye page, it was a collaboration. The initial design and the idea for the Flash animation came from Proud Creative, the same team responsible for the closure notice. They understood our brand deeply and were instrumental in helping us convey the right tone and emotion during our closing period. However, to ensure the animation stayed true to the character's original essence, we reached out to the show's usual animators to bring Krash to life in this context. It was crucial for us that the goodbye felt authentic to what our fans had grown to love about the series and the store. This teamwork between Proud Creative and the show's animators allowed us to create something truly special for our goodbye page. It was a somber task, but everyone involved put a lot of heart into it, knowing how much it would mean to both our team and the fans. The sound effects and music, which complemented the animation's emotional impact, were carefully selected to resonate with those who had shared in the joy and wonder of Riki. I'm genuinely touched to see it remembered and discussed here. It was a challenging time for all of us at the store, but knowing that we managed to leave a lasting, positive impression on our community brings me a lot of solace. And yes, steering our audience towards RolyPolyLand was our way of saying the adventure wasn't over. We wanted to leave a path forward, a token of continuity amidst the goodbye.

Shows a deep understanding of their audience's emotional landscape. User6: StoreMemories I recorded it because it felt so significant, like the end of an era. Jamie's rundown not only prepared us for what was next in the programming but also for a much bigger change in our community. It's moments like these that remind me why television can be such a powerful medium—it connects, comforts, and carries us through times of change. Now more than ever, I'm grateful for those thoughtful touches."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet saying that before every airing of the show in July, he said \\"We're here for you, even interrupting a game the kids were playing\\"","output":"@ClassicToonsFan: Just realized, before every airing of Kikoriki in July, Jamie from #Toonattik would say, \\"We're here for you,\\" even interrupting a game the kids on set were playing.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

their system by encrypting victim’s files with a strong encryption key making them inaccessible unless a ransom is paid. This malicious software often installs covertly on a victim’s computer, runs a cryptology attack that adversely affects it, and then requires payment from the victim to get a decryption key. Today, there are dozens of ransomware strains. Globally, ransomware continues to be a problem with new families emerging regularly. There are two types of ransomware in circulation. The common type today is crypto ransomware, which aims to encrypt files. The other is locker ransomware, which is designed to lock the computer, preventing victims from using it. In this assessment, we will only consider the crypto ransomware type. Your task is to design a new crypto ransomware based on the Feistel structure, which utilises a product cipher algorithm that combines three of the classical transposition and substitution ciphers. In this task, you will answer several questions that readers might ask about this ransomware: 1. Distribution scheme: Propose a way to distribute your ransomware to potential victims. Explain both the download and execution procedures. (10%) 2. Obfuscation: Propose a way to keep your ransomware hidden during both the infection and operation phases to prevent removal and analysis.

Within the realm of malware proliferation, three predominant channels stand preeminent: phishing [a mode of cyberattack that deceives individuals into divulging personal information by mimicking trusted entities via digital communications (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015)] campaigns, exploit kits, and malvertising [injection of malicious advertisements into legitimate networks, coercing users into downloading ransomware (Kharraz, et al., 2015)] which when coupled with phishing remains as one of the most pervasive vectors for ransomware distribution (Liska & Gallo, 2016). With regards to the ransomware in question, harnessing a synergistic integration of these channels possess the potentiality of markedly enhancing both penetration and efficacy. Leveraging sophisticated social engineering stratagems amidst phishing initiatives is quintessential to the architecture of this distribution methodology (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015). Through the strategic alteration of content hashing, emails ingeniously tailored with precision can surpass spam filtration mechanisms, thus demonstrating the propensity to manipulate recipients into inadvertently installing malware under the guise of attachments that echo ‘authenticity’ (Bertino & Islam, 2017). In conjunction with email marketing mediums such as Mailchimp and MailerLite to name a few, by means of compromised accounts, these services can be seamlessly harnessed to automate and augment the campaign. Concomitantly, exploit kits constitute an equally insidious disbursement vector. These apparatuses, orchestrated to identify and capitalise on frailties present in a victim’s browser or outdated plugins, guarantee the automated propulsion of the ransomware upon engagement with a compromised digital domain (Kotov & Massacci, 2013); exploit kits with Angler and Neutrino being exemplars, are amenable to utilisation, in view of their past adaptations by cybercriminal contingents for equivalent intents (O'Kane, et al., 2018). In the quest for optimising this technique, the adoption of Traffic Distribution Systems [TDS] may considerably expedite the delivery of the exploit kit to those signified by outmoded software repertoire. Obfuscation: The art of concealing the operational and pernicious junctures of crypto ransomware mandates an elaborate obfuscation strategy that affirms robustness in circumventing detection and subsequent scrutiny. Paramount to this strategy is the implementation of advanced obfuscation techniques, which not only just conceal the manifestation of ransomware, however also convolute its attack pattern, making decomposition and mitigation by cybersecurity defences a daunting challenge (You & Yim, 2010). Enacting obfuscation entails a nuanced approach, amalgamating both static [analysing code without requiring the programme to be executed] and dynamic [utilises real-time data for programme evaluation] methodologies to thwart analysis apparatuses and bypass dynamic analysis mechanisms, respectively (You & Yim, 2010). Static Obfuscation: Static obfuscation is proficiently attainable through the application of approaches including code encryption, coupled with the incorporation of remarkably evasive polymorphic malware [adaptively and continually alters its code via encryption (Li, et al., 2011)] and metamorphic malware [completely rewrites its code per cycle without any encryption (Li, et al., 2011)]. These approaches ingeniously modify the ransomware’s signature in successive iterations, all the while without compromising its intrinsic functionality, thereby outmanoeuvring signature-based detection protocols (Szor, 2005). Supplementary code fortification tools like VMProtect and Themida sophisticate code analysis through providing advanced virtualisation and encryption, profoundly hindering reverse engineering and decompilation (Eagle, 2008). Dynamic Obfuscation: The deployment of techniques in dynamic obfuscation, particularly runtime packers in conjunction with the insertion of junk code, considerably amplifies the surreptitious nature of ransomware. The application of these measures dynamically reshapes the code throughout the entirety of its execution, preventing runtime analysis whilst nullifying detection; supplemented with anti-debugging methods that exhibit the latency to counteract forensic and debugging technologies instantaneously- this bolsters this strategy, assuring the malware’s undertakings remain hidden (Udupa, 2005; Mickens, 2011). Command and Control (C&C) Communications: The quintessence of crypto ransomware’s operational versatility is encapsulated within its C&C framework, functioning as the hidden fulcrum for exchanging encrypted directives and key management between the compromised entity and the adversary’s server. This covert conduit, through the use of asymmetric encryption [a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys, public- that partakes in local encryption activities, and private- which is securely transmitted to the C&C server via encrypted channels] (Stallings, 2017)], fortifies the conveyance of the encryption key, indispensable for the cryptography of files, thereby upholding discretion against prospective interception (Paar & Pelzl, 2010; Stallings, 2017; Liska & Gallo, 2016). As cited by (Paar & Pelzl, 2010), this course sets in motion the ransomware generating a distinctive encryption key tailored to the victim’s files, guaranteeing the key’s resilience is impervious to brute-force attacks; a resultant chain of events that inexorably forces victims to disburse a ransom for the restitution of their data follows. To facilitate undetectable communications, this ransomware utilises a technique known as beaconing, whereby it transmits encrypted signals at regular intervals to connect with its C&C server. This method incorporates a Domain Generation Algorithm [/DGA- automatically generates a plethora of domain names that malware can use to establish connections with, command, and control servers], heightening the complexity of either blocking or tracing the server (Atonakakis, et al., 2011; Al-Rimy, et al., 2018). Communications evolve from simple HTTPs to intricate encrypted channels such as Tor/ I2P for key transmission, proficiently obscuring it from network traffic analysis (Huang, et al., 2018). To guarantee resilience confronting disruption, multiple fallback mechanisms are embedded within the ransomware’s architecture, streamlining an incessant reestablishment of severed connections. Furthermore, the C&C infrastructure leverages a decentralised model, diversifying its command vertices whilst significantly obstructing termination efforts by judicial bodies (Mickens, 2011). Each of these carefully crafted strategies are purported to elevate the durability and discreetness of this ransomware campaign, ensuring continuity and elusiveness in its operations. File Selection for Encryption: Leveraging the Feistel cipher framework, this ransomware purports to adopt a multifaceted strategy for the selection & encryption of files, incorporating an extensive assortment of file types essential for individual, and corporate usage (Stallings, 2011). This system proactively scouts for and encrypts files- extending from documents and images to emails and databases- contingent on their corresponding extensions, comprising .docx, .ost, .pdf, .pst, .png, .pst, and .sql, amongst others; thus, securing a comprehensive sweep of both ubiquitous and strategically critical data. Applying a recursive traversal algorithm, it assiduously searches local and networked repositories, effortlessly navigating multitudinous file systems and storage technologies, hence an exhaustive search in ensured by employing superior access rights obtained through exploitation techniques delineated previously (Casey, 2011; Carrier, 2005)- warranting vast ramifications, coercing victims toward ransom demand fulfilment. Analysing Ransomware Security: The advancing convolution of cryptographic ransomware, notably those founded on Feistel cipher architectures, demands thorough security scrutiny to mitigate prevalent cryptographic incursions (Anderson, 2008; Stinson, 2005). This prototype integrates the principles of transportation and substitution amid a Feistel construct, establishing a labyrinthine encryption approach- this resultantly presents considerable obstacles for adversaries seeking to decrypt files, and/ or locate and eradicate the ransomware sans financial indemnity (Bertino & Sandhu, 2005; Ferguson, et al., 2010). Mitigating Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: This cryptographic model employs successive encryption cycles, interweaving transposition and substitution procedures- such recursive profundity in encryption elevates the computational sophistication requisite for decrypting the cipher devoid of comprehension of the key, accordingly, subverting the efficacy of MitM attacks (Diffie & Hellman, 1976). Therefore, the introduction of non-linear constituents into encryption cycles considerably elevates the integrity of the encrypted data, markedly fortifying resistance to differential cryptanalysis by intensifying the complications in forging plaintext and ciphertext pair relational pairings (Biham & Shamir, 1991). Sequentially, the complexity of each cycle’s output heightens, diminishing the chance of discerning intermediate plaintext states imperative in foiling MitM attacks. Bypassing the Pitfalls of Frequency Analysis: Frequency analysis, an acclaimed instrument in cryptanalysis [the study of decrypting cryptographic systems (Stinson, 2005)] in the face of basic substitution ciphers, encounters a pronounced decline in effectiveness against the multifaceted encryption system of this ransomware in question. The employment of elaborate substitution algorithms, whose variations are iteratively administered throughout encryption sequences, substantially confounds frequency analysis activities. Concurrently, the sporadic variation of key schedules efficiently neutralises the dangers presented by conventional frequency-dependent cryptanalysis practices (Matsui, 1993). Characteristically, the Feistel structure systematically transmutes character frequency distributions across its encryption cycles, masterfully obsoleting frequency analysis for cipher deconstruction (Sinkov & Feil, 2009). Moreover, the presence of polyalphabetic components unremittingly modulates the substitution protocol, consequently corroding frequency analysis initiatives (Singh, 1999). Countermeasures for Brute Force Attacks: Feistel-centric architectures, with their dependency on extensive keys of variable length, inherently possess vigorous defensive measures to combat brute force attacks (Stinson, 2005). The calculated execution of key expansion strategies, by which short keys are methodologically elongated to more intricate, lengthier variants, calls for an exponentially greater computational exertion for brute force deciphering, accordingly, ingeniously enlisting time an ally against any unsanctioned decryption efforts (Hellman, 1980). This defence is fortified by an immense key space, via synthesising multiple conventional ciphers, rendering the notion of a meticulous key search ineffective within any feasible timeframe, consequently affording preservation against brute force attacks. Moreover, the implementation of a versatile key generation model, distinctively allocating keys for individual scenarios, adds a layer of convolutedness- subsequently thwarting brute force attack attempts (Schneier, 1996; Katz & Lindell, 2014). Counteractive Measures for Decryption and Detection: Decryption endeavours, absent the direct procurement of the corresponding decryption key is profoundly taxing due to the aforementioned cryptographic hindrances. Refined obfuscation manoeuvres, conjoined with the core complexities of encryption, not only obfuscate the decryption endeavours, but also mask the ransomware from signature-oriented detection algorithms, thereby fostering a stratified and multi-layered defence schema (You & Yim, 2010). Nevertheless, one cannot afford to ignore conceivable theoretical susceptibilities regarding cryptanalysis; the domain of cryptographic attacks is in perpetual flux, demanding sustained observances and optimisations to the encryption framework applied by the ransomware. In the realm of identifying ransomware, elaborate obfuscation alongside C&C communicative strategies elucidated herein serve to impede conventional heuristic and signature-based technologies (Ucci, et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the utilisation of sophisticated behavioural analysis instrumentation, monitoring system operations for deviations indicative of ransomware, yield a tangible method for discernment and deterrence without acceding to monetary demands. The engagement of decentralised machine learning-oriented models demonstrates the potential to distinguish the nuanced behavioural modalities of ransomware operations, promoting an anticipatory security stance (Apruzzese, et al., 2018). Preventative Actions Against Reverse Engineering: Warding off reverse engineering pursuits- imperative for the exposure and comprehension of the inner machinations of the ransomware- as formerly noted calls for the strategic usage of obfuscation techniques. Harnessing the prowess of refined software protection tools [take Enigma Protector and Code Virtualizer as exemplars], they metamorphose plain code into a confounding conundrum, vastly inhibiting the reverse engineering process, at the same time as consolidating the safeguarding measures, resultantly heightening the insurmountable hurdle for adversaries in pursuit of counteracting the ransomware devoid of unobstructed accessibility of the decryption key (Votipka, et al., 2018). This strategy adeptly shrouds logical patterns in secrecy whilst drastically augmenting the difficulty quotient and minimising the success threshold for cyber defence bodies endeavouring to crack and/ or invalidate the ransomware without complying to ransom payment (Megira, et al., 2018; Zander, et al., 2007). With the objective of bolstering resistance in opposition to reverse engineering, the synergistic melding of dynamic code analysis with runtime packers and polymorphism, all collectively infuse an additional stratum of complexity- a modification of which renders static analysis endeavours ineffective. Integrating anti-debugging measures is of paramount criticality in complicating the reverse engineering trajectory, hence fortifying defences against direct decryption or disassembly attempts without the designated key (Eagle, 2014). Payment Process Overview: The ransomware’s remittance mechanism is meticulously engineered, exemplifying stringent cryptographic diligence, and exploitation of users’ psychological susceptibilities. Victims are directed to an anonymised payment gateway intended to intuitively navigate the victim, predominantly leveraging cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, this primarily is for the undetectability, and fortified and private transactional attributes they advocate that aim to secure optimised security (Meiklejohn, et al., 2013). Comprehensible and linear instructions, comprehensively explicated via a Tor-encrypted webpage, steer victims along the transaction process, accentuating ease, and haste for rapid conformance- affirming a seamless experience. Allocating a unique wallet address to each victim diminishes risk while promoting transactional confidentiality; subsequent to payment, an automated verification system commences decryption key disbursement, capitalising on the blockchain’s inherent security for credence (Conti, et al., 2018; Franco, 2014).\\".","output":"In response to the escalating menace of ransomware attacks, it is paramount for organizations to devise and implement potent mitigation strategies. This section delineates both technical controls and compliance-related practices to thwart such malicious endeavors. **Technical Controls:** 1. **Endpoint Defense-in-Depth:** A stratified approach to endpoint security is imperative. Employing advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, which leverage behavioral analysis and machine learning, can preemptively detect and isolate ransomware activities (Al-rimy et al., 2018). Coupled with regular patch management protocols to address vulnerabilities and the deployment of application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized applications from executing, organizations can significantly reduce their ransomware susceptibility. 2. **Robust Data Backup and Recovery Plan:** The efficacy of ransomware heavily relies on its ability to leverage data as hostage. Implementing a comprehensive data backup and recovery plan, including regular backups, off-site storage solutions, and periodic restoration tests, ensures organizational resilience against data loss. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), backups should not be accessible from systems they're backing up to prevent ransomware from compromising them (NIST, 2020). **Compliance-Related Practices:** 1. **Cybersecurity Awareness and Training:** Enhancing the cybersecurity knowledge and vigilance of employees through regular training sessions can significantly curtail the effectiveness of phishing campaigns, a primary vector for ransomware dissemination. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) underscores the importance of cybersecurity education in safeguarding sensitive information (FTC, 2020). 2. **Adherence to Security Frameworks and Regulations:** Conforming to established cybersecurity frameworks, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and the Cybersecurity Framework by NIST, alongside sector-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, GLBA for financial services), fortifies an organization’s defense posture. These standards provide comprehensive guidelines on risk management, information security policies, and technical controls, fostering a culture of continuous security improvement. By integrating these technical and compliance-oriented strategies, organizations can bolster their defenses against the mounting threat of ransomware attacks, ensuring not only the security of their digital ecosystems but also fostering trust amongst stakeholders. **References:** - Al-rimy, B.
