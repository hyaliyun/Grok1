Now America's most influential rightwing media outlet is facing up to the chilling prospect of having a whistleblower in its own newsroom, notes the Independent. It could be even more cloakanddagger. Liberal website Media Matters has an informant planted at Fox leaking memos, crows Contact Music. One of the memos ordered reporters to use terms implying skepticism of global warming, another dictated terms when referring to the federal health care bill (such as referring to the socalled public option') which polled poorly with Americans in research conducted by the Republican Party. Both memos came from Bill Sammon, managing editor of Fox News' DC operation. The Union of Concerned Scientists yesterday blasted Fox for its unscientific take on global warming. Emails now suggest that this bias comes directly from the executives responsible for their news coverage, said a statement from the organization.

The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated. Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that reality is determined by past experience. Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience. The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation, in physical sciences as in ethics.

Make your liquids honeythick. Create a pudding consistency in you liquids.","output":"Thick liquids are essential for people who have difficulty swallowing or have dysphagia. These conditions make it hard to swallow regular liquids. Fortunately, there are ways to make your liquids thicker, so they are easier to swallow. One way to thicken liquids is to make a nectar-thick liquid. This consistency is similar to that of a light syrup or a thin honey texture. To create a nectar-thick liquid, you can add a commercial thickening agent, such as xanthan gum or cornstarch, to your beverage. Simply mix the thickening agent with the liquid until you achieve the desired consistency. Another option is to make your liquids honey-thick. Honey-thick liquids have the consistency of honey, making them easy to swallow. To make honey-thick liquids, you can use the same commercial thickening agents mentioned above, but with a different concentration. Honey-thick liquids are typically made with a larger quantity of thickeners than nectar-thick liquids. Finally, if you need a really thick liquid, you can create a pudding consistency in your liquids. Pudding-thick liquids are very thick, almost like soft pudding. This thicker consistency may be helpful if you have severe dysphagia or if you require a very slow flow of liquids. You can achieve a pudding consistency in your liquids by using a higher concentration of thickening agents than for nectar or honey-thick liquids. In conclusion, making your liquids thicker can greatly improve the quality of life for those with dysphagia or difficulty swallowing. By creating nectar-thick, honey-thick, or pudding-thick liquids, you can make swallowing easier and safer. These thickening techniques are simple to implement and can make a big difference in your daily life."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Fanny: Did u signed the pettition? Felix: which one?

The race is part of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, along with the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. The value of the Preakness Stakes has fluctuated over the years, with some years being more valuable than others. In answering the question of which year had a higher value, 1919 or 1946, the answer is 1946. In 1919, the Preakness Stakes had a total purse of 25,000, which was a significant amount of money at the time. However, in 1946, the total purse was increased to 50,000, making it the more valuable year. This increase in value was due in part to the end of World War II, which led to an increase in attendance and interest in the race. The winner of the 1919 Preakness Stakes was Sir Barton, who went on to win the Triple Crown that year. The winner of the 1946 Preakness Stakes was Assault, who also won the Triple Crown that year.

Practice deepbreathing to reduce anxiety. Worry less about what others think.","output":"The way we talk to ourselves is crucial in shaping our overall well-being. Oftentimes, our inner critic can overpower any positive self-talk we attempt to give ourselves. However, by practicing positive self-talk, we can gradually quiet our inner critic and improve our mental health. One way to start using positive self-talk is to list alternative positive thoughts. For example, instead of thinking, “I can’t do this,” we can reframe our thoughts to, “This may be challenging, but I am capable of overcoming it.” By swapping out negative thoughts for positive ones, we can shift our mindset and start believing in ourselves. Another effective technique to quiet our inner critic is to practice deep-breathing exercises. When we feel anxious or overwhelmed, our breathing can change, and we may start taking shallow breaths. By focusing on our breath and taking slow, deep breaths, we can signal to our body that we are safe and calm down our nervous system. It’s important to acknowledge that worrying about what others think is a common trap we can fall into. However, by reminding ourselves that our worth and value do not rely on other people’s opinions, we can release ourselves from the pressure of external validation. In conclusion, practicing positive self-talk, deep-breathing exercises, and worrying less about what others think are all effective strategies to quiet our inner critic and improve our mental health. By consistently implementing these practices, we can cultivate a positive and resilient mindset."},{"instruction":"Does However, fighting erupted again in July 2012. correctly answer the question of How many solider were killed in September when Islamic militants escaped?

However, a defense official has confirmed that this statement is far from the truth. While there has been a decrease in air travel due to travel restrictions and fear of contracting the virus, flights are still operating across the globe. This misinformation about flight disruptions was first reported by Wired.com. Such false reports can lead to panic and anxiety, causing individuals to cancel travel plans or unnecessarily stock up on supplies. It's important to verify information before spreading it. Meanwhile, drones continue to be used in targeted attacks against suspected militants in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen.

The use of drones in warfare raises ethical concerns, but for the military, they provide a strategic advantage in detecting and eliminating threats. In conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly disrupted many aspects of daily life, it's crucial to avoid spreading false information, especially when it concerns public safety.

The first bend point is the amount of annual earnings that triggers a higher percentage increase in the benefit calculation, while the second bend point is the earnings amount that triggers another percentage increase. As of 2021, the first bend point is 996/month, while the second bend point is 6,002/month. Therefore, the difference between the first and second bend points is 5,006/month or 60,072/year. This means that for an individual who earns above 6,002/month, their Social Security benefit calculation will increase at a lower rate than someone who earns below this threshold but above the first bend point.

By doing so, you can stay up-to-date with your favorite celebrity's life, career, and opinions. However, it's not just about following them - it's important to pay attention to how they use their Twitter account. First and foremost, take note of the frequency of their tweets. Do they tweet often or seldom? This can give you an idea of how involved they are in their social media presence. Some celebrities post several times a day, while others may only post a few times a week. Additionally, note the times at which they post - is it during typical working hours, or later in the day or night? Another important aspect to consider is the content of their tweets. Do they mainly post about their personal life, or do they use their account mainly for promoting their work? Some celebrities may use Twitter to share news, upcoming projects, or behind-the-scenes glimpses of their lives. On the other hand, others may use their account to share personal musings or to engage with their followers. It's also worth observing how the celebrity interacts with their followers on Twitter. Do they often respond to tweets or retweet posts from fans? This level of engagement can give you insight into their personality and how they view their relationship with their fanbase. Finally, keep an eye out for any controversies or Twitter feuds that the celebrity may be involved in. While it's not always possible to avoid drama completely, you might want to think twice about following someone who repeatedly gets into online spats or is known for making controversial comments. In conclusion, following a celebrity on Twitter can be a fun way to stay informed about their life and work. However, it's important to pay attention to how they use their account - frequency of tweets, content, engagement with followers, and any controversies - so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not to follow them."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: appreciate, darkness, miracle, sunrise, w","output":"I appreciate the darkness before the sunrise, for it makes the miracle of a new day all the more beautiful, even though I must wait patiently for its arrival."},{"instruction":"What great pizza!

These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution.

The 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory showcased Murray's dominance on grass, and bodes well for his prospects to retain the crown he won in 2016. The match was one-sided from the start, with Murray taking control and not letting go. His precision and power proved too much for Bautista Agut, who struggled to counter the Scot's relentless attack. Murray wasted little time in sealing the win, proving himself to be a cut above his opponent. Murray's performance demonstrates his focus and determination to defend his Wimbledon title. He has been in imperious form recently, winning the Queen's Club Championship for the fifth time last month. His serene start to the tournament bodes well for his chances of making a deep run, if not winning the championship outright. Murray's next opponent is South Africa's Kevin Anderson. The world number one will be hoping to maintain his form and keep his cool under pressure, as he looks to lay down a marker for the rest of the tournament. He will likely face tougher challenges as the tournament progresses, but his opening match showed that he is more than capable of rising to the occasion. Overall, Murray's performance in his opening match at Wimbledon was impressive and dominant.

The Qianlong Emperor sponsored the largest collection of writings in Chinese history, the Siku Quanshu, completed in 1782.

Determine the sign of your answer. Repeat this process for the second element in your reference row or column. Repeat with the third element. Add your three results together.","output":"A 3 x 3 matrix is a mathematical tool used in linear algebra to organize data in a concise manner. In this article, we will discuss a method to calculate the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix by choosing a single row or column. To begin, we need to write out our 3 x 3 matrix. Let's use the following matrix as an example: \`\`\` | 1 2 3 | | 4 5 6 | | 7 8 9 | \`\`\` Next, we choose a single row or column. Let's choose the first column: \`\`\` | 1 2 3 | | 4 5 6 | | 7 8 9 | \`\`\` We then cross out the row and column of the first element, which in this case is the element in the first row and first column (1). This gives us the following 2 x 2 matrix: \`\`\` | 5 6 | | 8 9 | \`\`\` We then find the determinant of this 2 x 2 matrix using the formula \`ad - bc\`. In this case, the determinant is (5*9) - (6*8) = -3. Next, we multiply the answer by our chosen element, which is 1. This gives us -3*1 = -3. We then need to determine the sign of our answer. In this case, our chosen element (1) is in the first column, which means that the sign of our answer is positive. We repeat this process for the second and third elements in our reference column. The second element is 4, which gives us a determinant of (2*9) - (3*8) = -6. Multiplying this by 4 gives us -6*4 = -24. Since 4 is in an odd position, the sign of our answer is negative. Finally, we repeat the process for the third element, which is 7. This gives us a determinant of (2*6) - (3*5) = -3. Multiplying this by 7 gives us -3*7 = -21. Since 7 is in an even position, the sign of our answer is positive. We add our three results together (-3 - 24 + 21) to get a final answer of -6. In conclusion, the method described in this article is an efficient way to calculate the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix by choosing a single row or column. It involves crossing out the row and column of each element in the chosen row or column and finding the determinant of the resulting 2 x 2 matrix, multiplying it by the chosen element, and determining the sign of the answer based on the position of the chosen element."},{"instruction":"Based on the sentence A dog is preparing to run away from a person interacting with it., is the sentence a cat is playing with some string a true sentence?

Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie.

Brian Matthews has been presented in court where he has been accused of neglecting his vulnerable mother, Winifred. The court heard that Matthews only visited her once a month, leaving her to fend for herself. This has led to the deterioration of the living conditions of his mother's home. To add insult to injury, Matthews has also been accused of taking £18,000 of his mother's pension. This is a grave offence as his mother was entirely dependent on this pension to sustain herself. It is deplorable that Matthews chose to take advantage of his mother’s vulnerable state and take her money for personal profit. The neglect and mistreatment of elderly people is becoming a concern in society, and this case brings up a significant issue.

It is a basic human right to be able to live in conditions that are clean and habitable. Matthews has denied responsibility for his actions, but the evidence against him is compelling. Justice must be served, and he must face the consequences of his actions. This case is an excellent reminder that neglect is an offence that carries significant consequences.

Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17thcentury France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital.

Perform a squat stretch. Stretch the sole of your foot with your hands. Do all foot stretches gently.","output":"Stretching is an essential part of any exercise routine. Stretching your muscles increases flexibility and range of motion, which can help prevent injuries and enhance performance. When we think about stretching, we tend to focus on larger muscle groups like the hamstrings or the quadriceps, but it's equally important to stretch smaller muscles like those in the feet. There are several foot stretches you can do to improve the flexibility and strength of muscles in the feet. One easy stretch is the wall stretch. Start by standing facing a wall with your feet hip-width apart. Place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, then slowly lean your body forward, keeping your heels on the ground. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds before releasing. Another stretch you can do is the squat stretch. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then slowly lower your body into a squat position. Place your elbows inside your knees and gently press them outward, while keeping your heels on the ground. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds before standing back up. Stretching the sole of your foot with your hands is another useful technique. Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you. Take a towel or strap and place it under the ball of your foot. Gently pull the towel towards your body with both hands, keeping your leg straight. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds before releasing and repeating on the other foot. It's important to remember to stretch all foot muscles gently. The muscles in the feet are small and delicate, so be sure not to overdo it. Incorporating these stretches into your exercise routine can help you improve the flexibility and strength of your feet, which can help prevent injuries and make everyday activities easier."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Boon Brewery (Brouwerij Boon) is a Belgian brewery situated in Lembeek, near Brussels, that mainly produces geuze and kriek beer of a fairly traditional lambic variety, but using distinctly modern brewing techniques and equipment.

Selective breeding for fast growth, egglaying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises.

Plus, who makes my topfive penalty takers of all time?","output":"Both Arsenal and Manchester City are having strong seasons in the domestic competitions, with the potential to make history by winning the Premier League and FA Cup respectively. However, both clubs have their sights set on the elusive Champions League trophy, which could cloud their judgment as they prioritize this competition over others. In particular, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini should consider not taking his key players to the Nou Camp for their upcoming match against Barcelona. With a 2-1 deficit from the first leg, Pellegrini may be tempted to rely on his star men to overturn the deficit. However, injuries or suspensions picked up in this crucial match could cause further harm to City's chances of winning a first ever Champions League title. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal face a similarly tough task as they travel to Bayern Munich, who lead 2-0 from the first leg. Wenger may feel that he has nothing to lose by fielding his strongest team, but the risk of injury or fatigue to his key players must be weighed against the low probability of a comeback. Turning to a more light-hearted topic, here are my top-five penalty takers of all time. First and foremost, it has to be Rickie Lambert, who has a near-perfect record from the spot. Frank Lampard also deserves a place on the list, having scored crucial penalties for Chelsea and England over the years.

The stark contrast of white against the natural color of your skin can create a bold, edgy look that is perfect for both day and night occasions. One of the main benefits of white eyeliner is how it can brighten up your eyes, making them appear larger and more awake. This is especially useful for those days where you may not have gotten enough sleep or are feeling a bit tired. Simply applying a bit of white eyeliner on your waterline can do wonders for making you look more alert. Another way to experiment with white eyeliner is by using it as a base for your eyeshadow. It can act as a blank canvas and allow your eyeshadow colors to pop even more than they usually would. You can also use white eyeliner to create a subtle winged liner look, which is a great alternative to the classic black wing. When it comes to choosing a white eyeliner, it’s important to look for a formula that glides on smoothly and has good staying power. You’ll want to make sure that the white pigment is opaque and not sheer, so that it shows up well against your skin. Overall, experimenting with white eyeliner can be a fun way to switch up your makeup routine and add a touch of uniqueness to your look.

Despite extensive searches, no trace of them was found. Relatives of Captain Bridge initiated a search campaign that involved important resources, resulting in the U.S. Navy warship finding the wrecked hull over 1,000 miles from Cape Cod. However, that left little hope for a joint rescue mission comprising more than 20 vessels dispatched by the American authorities and the UK Coastguard. Unfortunately, this search party ended in vain as the undeployed life raft was found, and the hopes of finding the four sailors alive ended too. The sad news emerged after a week-long search that highlighted the committed efforts to find the missing yachtsmen. British Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his condolences upon learning about the sailors' death. He extended sympathies to the families of the missing persons, saying that the country shared the loss with the families who had done their best to search for their loved ones. Foreign Secretary William Hague also paid his respects and praised the naval search teams for their hard work. The boat wreckage was found far out in the Atlantic Ocean, some 1,000 miles east of Massachusetts by the coastguard on board the U.S. Navy warship \\"Jason Dunham\\". Investigations later revealed that the capsized hull showed no signs of distress, vessel impact, or having been hit by a larger craft. The causes of the incident remain undisclosed. In general, the sad climax that involved the missing sailors and the massive search effort targeted towards discovering them highlighted the extent of risks facing all seafarers in the severely changeable Atlantic weather patterns.

The incident quickly caught the attention of GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization, who tweeted about the incident, expressing their disappointment in Baldwin's use of the offensive language. The tweet sparked a conversation online, with many weighing in on Baldwin's behavior and whether or not he should face consequences for his actions. Baldwin, meanwhile, responded to the controversy on his own Twitter account, where he announced that he would be retiring the word from his vocabulary. \\"My ill-advised use of a hurtful term does not reflect who I am or what I believe,\\" he wrote. \\"I will be forever sorry for any pain or upset that I caused.\\" While many have applauded Baldwin's decision to retire the word, others remain skeptical, questioning whether or not the actor is truly committed to changing his behavior.
