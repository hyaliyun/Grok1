Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes being ahead of oneself when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future—we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.

Make reading fiction a regular habit. Get inspiration from nonfiction sources. Consider brainstorming with a close friend or group. Sit down at the computer and type something, anything, to get started.","output":"Creating written work, whether it be a novel, screenplay, or short story, can be a daunting task. However, there are simple yet effective ways to initiate the process of writing and stay inspired throughout. Here are a few techniques to establish as habits to boost your creativity and productivity. First and foremost, consider carrying a small notebook everywhere you go. This allows you to capture any sudden ideas that may arise while you’re out and about. Jot down these thoughts, lines, or character descriptions as soon as possible, so that they don’t escape your memory. It’s essential to keep this notebook on hand as much as possible, since you never know when inspiration will strike. Secondly, make reading fiction a regular habit. It’s crucial to immerse ourselves in the craft we want to pursue. Reading other authors’ work can inspire us to find our unique voice or pick up new techniques. Moreover, analyzing plot structures, character arcs, and writing styles from the fiction we consume can influence our own writing. Thirdly, draw inspiration from non-fiction sources. Reading non-fiction can provide us with valuable information to incorporate into our own writing while building our knowledge about a subject. Hence, in turn, making our work more informed, original, and intriguing. Moreover, forming a brainstorming group with a close friend or a small group can be an effective way to explore new ideas and receive feedback on existing ones. This enables us to talk through potential plot lines or character development with others and obtain constructive feedback. Starting a writing club of sorts can be an excellent way to build accountability and grow as writers. Lastly, when all else fails, sit down at your computer and type whatever comes to mind. Sometimes staring at a blank page can lead to a creative block. However, typing anything, no matter how bad it may seem, can help get the creative juices flowing.

Another way to improve your sexual performance is to start doing pelvic floor exercises.

They can also improve the strength and intensity of your erections. Cutting down on alcohol and other drugs can also help to improve your sexual performance.

This includes all regular season and postseason games played by the 32 teams in the league. To give some context, a touchdown in football is worth six points and can be scored in different ways, such as running with the ball, catching a pass, or recovering a fumble or an interception in the end zone. However, when we talk about touchdowns scored by runs, we specifically refer to those plays where a player carries the ball across the goal line without throwing or receiving it. In terms of the distribution of these touchdowns among the teams, the Baltimore Ravens led the league with 24 touchdowns by runs, followed by the Tennessee Titans and the Arizona Cardinals with 23 and 22, respectively. On the other hand, the New York Giants and the New York Jets were the teams with the lowest number of touchdowns by runs, both with only 3 throughout the season. It is worth mentioning that the number of touchdowns by runs can vary significantly between seasons and even between individual games. This is due to factors such as the offensive strategy used by each team, the performance of the players involved, and the defensive tactics of the opposing team, among others. In any case, touchdowns by runs are an exciting and essential element of football, as they demonstrate the physical abilities and tactical skills of the players and contribute to the overall success of their teams."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Jeremias Wigger was a swiss cheese maker Jeremias Wigger (born 10 March 1965) was a Swiss cross country skier who competed from 1988 to 1998.

Write out your count by hand.","output":"When it comes to tracking various aspects of your life, there are numerous methods you can use. Depending on your personal preferences, you may find that one works better for you than others. Here are three options to consider: using a mobile app, trying a digital tracker on your computer, and writing out your count by hand. First, let's talk about mobile apps. There are countless apps available on both Google Play and the App Store that can be used to track anything from physical activity to food intake to water consumption. Some popular options include MyFitnessPal, Fitbit, and WaterMinder. These apps often have features such as reminders, progress tracking, and goal setting. They can be convenient and easy to use, especially if you always have your phone with you. Next, you could consider trying a digital tracker on your computer. Many people prefer to use a spreadsheet or document to track their habits, with the added benefit of being able to access it on their computer or laptop. This can be a good option if you don't want to use your phone for tracking or prefer a more customizable approach. Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets are helpful tools for creating a personalized tracker. Finally, there's always the option to write out your count by hand. For some, this method may seem old-fashioned, but it can be effective for others. Writing things down can help with memory retention and increase mindfulness. Plus, it doesn't require any technology or have potential for distractions. A good old-fashioned pen and paper is all you need to start tracking your habits. In conclusion, there is no one right way to track your progress. By considering these three methods, you can find the one that works best for you. Whether it's using an app on your mobile, trying a digital tracker on your computer or simply writing out your count by hand, the important thing is to find a method you can stick with to help you achieve your goals."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: We're an American Band (from the album of the same name) became Grand Funk Railroad's first #1 single on September 29, 1973, Mark Farner's 25th birthday.

The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field, Ampère's force law, was discovered later by AndréMarie Ampère in 1820. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A freehanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.

In 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War on the side of the Central Powers. With the Ottoman Empire situated to the east of the canal, it became a vulnerable point of attack. The first Ottoman attack on the canal occurred in February 1915 when a force of 18,000 soldiers attempted to invade the British-held city of Ismailia via the canal. However, they were repelled by British forces. For the next four years, the British and their allies launched numerous attacks against Ottoman positions in Egypt while also fortifying the canal's defenses. These efforts proved successful as the Ottomans were unable to successfully breach the canal again. In August 1919, the Ottomans signed the Treaty of Sèvres, which recognized the canal as an international waterway and ensured its protection from further attacks.

Symptoms include depression, obesity, fatigue and chronic pain.","output":"Misdiagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a real concern among patients who are suffering from post-traumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) caused by head injuries. PTHP is a condition that affects the pituitary gland, which is responsible for producing and regulating hormones that control various bodily functions. Symptoms of PTHP include depression, obesity, chronic pain, and intense fatigue, which could be mistaken for CFS. When the pituitary gland sustains damage following head injuries, there is a risk of PTHP developing. Patients with PTHP may experience imbalances in their crucial hormones, such as thyroid, testosterone or cortisol hormones. As a result, patients often experience symptoms such as lethargy, anxiety, mood disorders, weight issues, menstrual and libido problems, and cognitive difficulties. Unfortunately, it can be easy to misdiagnose PTHP as CFS because of the seemingly similar symptoms that these two conditions share. It is essential that doctors conducting assessments on patients fully investigate their medical history and seek out the root cause of their symptoms correctly. Medical practitioners who are treating patients with chronic fatigue should be well acquainted with PTHP and should have adequate knowledge about how to diagnose the condition. Early diagnosis and early treatment can improve the quality of life for patients and may prevent the exacerbation of severe symptoms which are associated with PTHP. In conclusion, patients who have sustained a head injury or trauma must be aware of PTHP and its symptoms so that they can seek medical assistance from professionals who can provide a prompt diagnosis and treatment. When medical practitioners correctly diagnose PTHP, patients can receive the best possible chances of recovery, making a significant difference in the lives of both patients and their families."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"Today's achievements have left me feeling grateful and inspired.

Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code.

The family of Wrenna recently revealed their daughter's transformation to become their son, Wren. Wren's journey to live his life authentically has been a process that has involved significant changes, including taking injections to delay puberty to allow him time to adjust to male life. The process of transitioning can be a deeply personal experience for those involved, and it can take time for everyone to adjust. For Wren, the decision to transition from a female to male was one that he made after much reflection and introspection. It involved coming out to his family and friends, who have supported him throughout his journey. One of the steps in Wren's transition involves taking injections to delay puberty. This is a common procedure for individuals who identify as transgender and want to take their time adjusting to their new gender before undergoing any permanent changes. Delaying puberty allows Wren to have more time to explore and understand his gender identity and what it means to live as a male in society. The decision to delay puberty is not an easy one, as it involves significant medical procedures and can have long-term effects on Wren's body. However, for Wren and his family, it was an essential step in his transition process. Wren's parents have been supportive of his journey and have helped him navigate the challenges that come with transitioning. Wren's journey highlights the importance of support and understanding for those who are going through the process of transitioning. For Wren, the decision to become his authentic self was one that involved courage, determination, and a deep understanding of who he is. By supporting him in his journey, his family has helped him navigate the challenges that come with transitioning. In conclusion, Wren's transformation from Wrenna to Wren is a powerful reminder of the importance of supporting and understanding individuals who are going through the process of transitioning. By delaying puberty, Wren has been given the time and space to adjust to his new gender identity, and his family has been a crucial source of support throughout his journey.

Store your boots individually. Stuff your boots to help them retain their shape.","output":"Taking proper care of your boots is essential to ensure their longevity and to keep them in top condition. One of the key strategies to keep in mind is to avoid stressing the material. This means that you should avoid any actions or storage methods that place undue pressure on the material of the boot. One way to achieve this is to store your boots individually, instead of piling them on top of one another in a crowded closet or storage area. This can help to prevent dents, creases, or other types of damage that can occur when boots are stacked on top of each other. Another important tip for boot care is to stuff your boots when you're not wearing them. This can help them to retain their shape and prevent any sagging or deformation that can occur over time. There are a variety of materials that you can use for this purpose, including newspaper, tissue paper, or specially-designed boot shapers. Simply insert the insert into the boot, and leave it in place until you're ready to wear your boots again. With regular use, this can help to keep your boots looking great and feeling comfortable for years to come. In addition to these tips, there are many other strategies that you can use to care for your boots and protect them from damage. For example, you might want to consider investing in a protective spray or other type of finish that can help to repel water and other substances, preventing stains and other types of damage. You should also be sure to clean your boots regularly, using a soft brush or damp cloth to gently remove dirt and grime.

Understand the Direction of Force. Understand Net Force.","output":"Understanding the Concepts of Acceleration and Force To understand the principles of motion and how objects move, it is important to first understand the basic concepts of acceleration and force. Acceleration is the rate at which an object changes its velocity over time. Force, on the other hand, is a push or pull that causes an object to move or change direction. The direction of acceleration is important in understanding how an object will move. Acceleration can be either positive or negative, which indicates whether an object is speeding up or slowing down. For example, if an object is moving in a straight line and its speed increases, its acceleration is considered positive. If it slows down, then its acceleration is considered negative. The direction of force is also important in understanding how an object will move. The amount and direction of force are both factors that contribute to an object's movement. If an object experiences a force that is stronger in one direction than another, it will move in the direction of the stronger force. Net force is the amount of force that is acting on an object overall. It takes into account all of the individual forces that are acting on the object and determines their overall effect. If an object experiences a net force in one direction, it will move in that direction. In summary, understanding the direction of acceleration, the direction of force, and net force is crucial in understanding how objects move. Science and engineering rely heavily on principles of motion, and a strong foundation of these basic concepts is essential."},{"instruction":"Pat: Who's coming tonight?

By consistently observing the subject, you can develop a deeper understanding of its nature and behavior. It is also important to focus on the details when observing a subject. This can involve paying attention to small movements, gestures, or changes in behavior that may be overlooked by others. By honing your observation skills in this way, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject and its significance.

Imagine being able to skip the hour-long line for your favorite street cart just by paying a small fee. It may sound too good to be true, but it's just one of the many ways these apps are changing the way New Yorkers experience the city. Of course, some may argue that these apps are taking advantage of those who can't afford to pay for exclusive experiences on their own. However, proponents of these apps argue that they provide a valuable service by allowing people to experience things they otherwise wouldn't be able to. Plus, by allowing people to sell their reservations or spots in line, it helps to cut down on waste and reduce the number of no-shows at popular establishments.

Omega3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from proinflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward antiinflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA).

Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of largerscale superstores (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them.

Brendan Rodgers, the team's manager, has also expressed confidence in his players.

Mix the solution before use.","output":"Making solutions of various types is a common practice in different fields, from chemistry to medicine, and even in cleaning products. But the process of making a solution is not as simple as just mixing two or more substances together. To make an effective solution, it is essential to follow a few essential steps. The first step is to collect all the supplies required for making the solution. This includes the raw materials like chemicals, solvents, and water, along with the equipment necessary for mixing, measuring, and storing the solution. It is crucial to read the label on every ingredient to ensure that the correct amount of each substance is measured for the solution. The next step is to combine the ingredients in the right proportions. The measurements for each component should be precise to achieve the desired outcome. Mixing the ingredients haphazardly or in the wrong amounts can result in a chemical reaction that can be dangerous or ineffective. After combining the ingredients, the solution should rest for some time. This allows the chemicals to interact with each other and dissolve properly, leading to a more homogeneous mixture. Resting times may vary depending on the specific solution being made, and it's important to follow the instructions carefully. Finally, before using the solution, it is essential to mix it properly. Even when a solution has rested adequately, settling of the components can occur, resulting in an uneven mixture. Before applying or using the solution, it should be mixed thoroughly to ensure that all the ingredients are evenly distributed. In conclusion, making a solution involves collecting the necessary supplies, carefully combining the ingredients, letting the mixture rest and, finally, mixing it correctly. Following these steps will help ensure that the solution works effectively and achieves the desired result."},{"instruction":"Yes.

The witness, who did not want to be named, said that ISIS members were promising security and stability to those who returned, but that many were afraid to do so.

Meanwhile, residents of Falluja report that most government forces have pulled back from the city, leaving it vulnerable to further ISIS attacks. Falluja has long been a hotbed of violence and instability, and many fear that ISIS will use the city as a base from which to launch attacks on other parts of Iraq.

In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an exciting fact directly led to a physiological response, known as emotion. To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the James–Lange theory. As James wrote, the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, is the emotion. James further claims that we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.

Find snails to put in your container","output":"When it comes to owning snails, it's important to provide them with a suitable habitat. For short term projects, any container with air holes will do. However, if you plan on keeping them for a longer period of time, it's best to invest in a larger tank or terrarium such as a Kritter Keeper. One crucial factor to consider is air circulation. Snails require fresh air to breathe, so make sure your tank or terrarium has adequate ventilation. Keeping the tank at room temperature is also important, as extreme heat or cold can be harmful to your pet snails. Before setting up the habitat, purchase terrarium soil or earth from outside to create a natural environment for your snails to thrive. Add a layer of natural materials on top of the soil, such as leaves or small twigs, to provide your snails with hiding spots and areas to explore. Decorating your snail's home is a fun way to personalize their space. Use non-toxic materials such as rocks or plants, but be cautious not to overcrowd the space. Snails require plenty of roaming space, so make sure you don't add too many decorations. It's also important to attach a heavy or fastened lid to the tank or terrarium to prevent escape. Snails are adept at finding their way out of containers, so make sure the lid is secure. Lastly, find snails to put in your container. You can purchase them from a pet store or gather them from your garden or local area. Remember to handle your snails gently and only touch them with wet hands to prevent damaging their fragile shells. By following these simple steps, you can create a safe, natural, and personalized environment for your pet snails to thrive in."},{"instruction":"Next question: who plays sophie's boyfriend in mamma mia?","output":"The name of Sophie's boyfriend in Mamma Mia is Sky and he is played by actor Dominic Cooper."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: Latest visit 19 September 2004 2134","output":"Latest visit: 19 September 2004, 21:34."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"Today is a beautiful day!

Without knowing the details of the game in question, it is impossible to provide an exact answer to this question. However, we can take a look at some general statistics to understand the potential difference in yardage between the two types of plays. In general, a TD run will typically cover a shorter distance than a TD pass. According to NFL statistics, the average length of a touchdown run is around 10 yards, while the average length of a touchdown pass is around 25 yards. Of course, there are many factors that can influence the length of a play, including the skill of the players involved, the defensive strategies being used, and the specific situation in the game. That being said, we can make some educated guesses about the potential difference in yardage between a TD run by Rhodes and a TD pass caught by Gonzalez. If we assume that Rhodes's TD run was a relatively short one - say, around 5-10 yards - and that Gonzalez's TD catch was on the longer side - perhaps around 30-40 yards - then we might expect the difference in yardage to be somewhere in the range of 20-35 yards. Again, it's important to note that these are just estimates, and the actual difference in yardage could be larger or smaller depending on a wide range of variables. Ultimately, the best way to get an accurate answer to this question would be to look up the specific game in which these plays occurred and check the game statistics. Without that information, all we can do is make informed guesses based on general trends and averages."},{"instruction":"ECE is a familyowned business established in 1965 What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"The given sentence is already correctly punctuated."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

Know when to see a doctor.","output":"When it comes to taking care of injuries at home, there are a few steps to follow to ensure proper healing. First and foremost, it's crucial to clean the affected area thoroughly to prevent infection. Once the area is clean, it's time to start applying some of the remedies that will help with pain and promote healing. One of the first things to try is applying powder. This can be useful in areas where sweat or moisture may accumulate, such as under the arms or in between toes. It will help to keep the area dry and reduce friction, which can be especially helpful for rashes or chafing. If there are any cuts or scrapes, it's a good idea to apply an ointment to the affected area. Ointments can help to speed up the healing process and prevent scarring. There are a wide variety of ointments to choose from, such as Neosporin or Aquaphor, so be sure to find one that's appropriate for your particular injury. If the area is swollen or inflamed, using ice packs can help to reduce the swelling and alleviate the pain. Ice packs can be applied for 20 minutes at a time, a few times a day. Another option is to use soothing gels or oils, such as aloe vera or lavender oil, to provide relief to the affected area. For some injuries, taking a soothing bath may be helpful. Adding Epsom salts or essential oils can provide additional relief for sore muscles or bruising. For an extra pampering experience, try adding some candles and calming music to help you relax. Lastly, it's important to know when it's time to see a doctor. If an injury is severe or shows signs of infection, it's best to seek professional medical help. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, warmth, and discharge from the affected area. In conclusion, taking care of injuries at home can be a simple process. By following these steps of cleaning the area, applying powder, an ointment or ice packs, and taking soothing baths or gels, you can speed up healing and get back to your daily routine. Just remember to seek medical attention if the injury shows signs of infection."},{"instruction":"Queen (band): After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, rumours began to spread that Mercury was suffering from AIDS. Mercury flatly denied this, insisting he was merely exhausted and too busy to provide interviews. The band decided to continue making albums, starting with The Miracle in 1989 and continuing with Innuendo in 1991. Despite his deteriorating health, the lead singer continued to contribute. For the last two albums made while Mercury was still alive, the band credited all songs to Queen, rather than specific members of the group, freeing them of internal conflict and differences. In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with Disney's Hollywood Records, which has since remained the group's music catalogue owner in the United States and Canada. That same year, Mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

Heather, who is 39 years old, had emailed her son's teacher asking for updates on his behavior after consuming the drug without a prescription. Adderall is a central nervous system stimulant that contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. This medication is commonly prescribed to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. However, it is a controlled substance, which means that it is illegal to use or distribute it without a prescription. Heather's move to give her son Adderall was not only illegal, but also potentially dangerous. The drug can cause side effects such as insomnia, loss of appetite, and even heart problems. Children who are not diagnosed with ADHD and take the medication can experience adverse effects such as nervousness, agitation, and behavior changes. The fact that Heather contacted her son's teacher to ask for updates on his behavior after giving him the drug shows that she knew that it was not a legal or ethical practice. It is unclear whether Heather had been taking the medication herself, and if so, whether she was doing so under a doctor's supervision. The incident serves as a reminder that using controlled substances without a prescription is not only illegal but also potentially dangerous. Parents should never give their children medication without a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare provider.

Despite being retired, he couldn't stay away from what he enjoyed: providing great customer service and supporting his family. Next year, Charlie Reynolds Sr. will finally retire from the family business, at the same time as his son, Charlie Jr., who will turn 65. For 50 years, Charlie Jr. has been tirelessly serving customers, taking only one vacation in that time. But with the end of the family business, comes a well-deserved retirement for both of them. The Reynolds family knows how to work hard, but they also value family time and cherish the moments they spend together. Despite the long hours and hard work, they have kept the store running smoothly and the customers satisfied. It is a rare quality to find such dedicated family members who work together so well. Charlie Reynolds Sr. has been a valuable member of the Reynolds family business, bringing decades of experience and industry knowledge to the table. Even though he was not officially working, he was always present, and his influence on the business was never underestimated. His dedication and commitment to the store will be greatly missed, but his legacy will continue. Charlie Jr. has worked tirelessly in the store for 50 years, never wavering in his commitment to his family's business. His work ethic and dedication were unparalleled. It was only right that he and his father would retire together, closing a chapter in their lives, but one that had brought them much success and happiness. The Reynolds family has left a significant impact on their small community, providing a great example of the importance of hard work and commitment. The store will continue after their retirement, but it will never be the same without them. They have proven that family businesses can still thrive in modern times, and their story will inspire many for years to come. Congratulations to Charlie Jr. and Sr. on their upcoming retirement, and may they enjoy their well-deserved break."},{"instruction":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: For about ten years the factory is Pasinger with one or two productions a year as the smallest Munich Oper","output":"For about ten years, the factory has been Pasinger, with one or two productions per year, as the smallest Munich Opera."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],H={key:0},q={key:1};function F(o,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",B,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
