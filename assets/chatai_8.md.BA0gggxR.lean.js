Theodosius I briefly reunited the Empire: in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults. He not only refused to restore Victory to the senatehouse, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors. Ambrose, the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint, wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus's request for tolerance. Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of Rome's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms.[clarification needed] He was the last emperor of both East and West.

The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her playhours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.

This news is a cause for concern for both rail operators and passengers alike. The damage appears to have resulted from adverse weather conditions, including strong winds and heavy rain. Tracks have been damaged by fallen trees, while overhead lines have been affected by debris and flying objects. The damage has been so severe in some instances that train services across the country have been disrupted, with cancellations and delays affecting many passengers. Network Rail has been working hard to repair the damage and get services running again as quickly as possible. However, the scale of the challenge means that it will take time to restore normal service. In the meantime, passengers are advised to check their journey before travelling and allow extra time for their journey. This incident highlights the vulnerability of the UK's rail infrastructure to extreme weather conditions. Network Rail has invested significant resources in improving the resilience of the network, but events such as this show that more needs to be done. Passengers have a role to play too. By checking the status of their journey before setting out, they can avoid unnecessary delays and help to reduce the demand on the rail network. They can also report any damage to tracks or overhead lines to Network Rail, which can help to speed up repairs and minimise disruption. In conclusion, the substantial damage to the tracks and overhead lines reported by Network Rail is a reminder of the challenges facing the UK's rail network.

However, in today's world, social distancing has become a norm due to the ongoing pandemic. This has left many feeling lonely and isolated, and hugging may not always be an option. But fear not, as there are still ways to feel the warmth and comfort of a hug even with physical distance. One way is to hug a pillow. Hugging a soft and fluffy pillow can simulate the feeling of a real hug, and it can bring comfort and ease to those feeling lonely. Another way is to cuddle with an animal. Pets are great companions and can offer unconditional love and affection, which is essential for emotional well-being. Additionally, nature can also provide a sense of comfort and tranquility. Hugging a tree or feeling the breeze in the backyard can bring calmness and serenity to the mind. On the other hand, if physical touch is not possible, virtual and long-distance hugging partners can be an option. Facetime or other video calling apps can simulate hugging and can make one feel closer and connected to their loved ones, even if they are far away.

This plan was devised by the chief executive, Dave Lewis, who took on the role last month.

This move is part of a larger strategy to revamp Tesco and make it more competitive in the market.

Trust your employees: Trust is a vital component of any successful workplace, whether you're working on a small team or across multiple departments. By empowering your colleagues to make decisions and take ownership of projects, you can build a more supportive and effective workplace culture overall. 5.

It is a strippeddown, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in grampositive bacteria. In endospore formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall. One side then engulfs the other. Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. There are many reports of spores remaining viable over 10,000 years, and revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. There is one report of viable spores of Bacillus marismortui in salt crystals approximately 250 million years old.

Reports indicate that the infant passed away while sleeping in the same bed as Jennings. This is not the first time that the city has seen such a tragedy. In 2012, James 'Bo' Phillips passed away under similar circumstances at just four months old. The alarming frequency of infant deaths while co-sleeping has led to a heightened awareness of the potential dangers. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advises against sleeping with infants, as it significantly increases the risk of suffocation or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). While some parents may choose to co-sleep out of convenience, the risks clearly outweigh any perceived benefits. It is important to note that no charges have yet been proven against Jennings. However, these tragic incidents serve as a clear reminder of the potential dangers of co-sleeping. Parents should always prioritize the safety of their children, even if it means sacrificing some convenience or comfort. It is better to err on the side of caution and ensure that infants have a separate sleep space that is free from any potential hazards. In conclusion, the deaths of James 'Bo' Phillips and Luke Phillips serve as a stark reminder of the importance of safe sleeping practices for infants. Parents and caregivers should never take these risks lightly, and must remain vigilant to ensure the safety of their children. Co-sleeping may seem like a comforting practice, but the potential consequences are too severe to ignore."},{"instruction":"Aatank Hi Aatank (English:Terror everywhere) is a 1995 Indian crime film was written, edited and directed by Dilip Shankar.

Open your mouth wide. Tighten the muscles at the back of your throat. Take a deep breath through your mouth. Stay in position until you feel a yawn coming.","output":"Yawning is a natural bodily function that we have all experienced at one point or another. It is something that happens subconsciously, and we often don't give it much thought. However, have you ever stopped to think about why we yawn, or how to induce a yawn? The process of initiating a yawn is quite simple. First, open your mouth wide. This action alone may be enough to trigger a yawn in some people, as seeing someone else yawn can cause a chain reaction of yawns. Next, tighten the muscles at the back of your throat. This should create a feeling of tension and pressure in your throat. Once the muscles at the back of your throat are tightened, take a deep breath through your mouth. This breath should be slow and steady, filling your lungs with air. It is important to take a full breath, rather than a shallow one, as this helps to increase oxygen intake and promote relaxation. Finally, stay in this position until you feel a yawn coming. This may take a few seconds or several minutes, depending on the individual. When the yawn finally arrives, it will likely be accompanied by a feeling of relief and relaxation. While the act of yawning is often associated with tiredness or boredom, there is actually more to it than meets the eye. Yawning is believed to serve several functions, such as regulating brain temperature, increasing oxygen intake, and promoting social bonding. In conclusion, yawning is a natural and essential bodily function that we all experience. While it may seem like a simple act, the science behind it is fascinating. So next time you feel the urge to yawn, think about the intricate processes that are happening within your body, and appreciate the many benefits that come with this simple yet powerful action."},{"instruction":"Keywords: airport, enter, passenger What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","output":"Passengers must enter the airport through designated entrances."},{"instruction":"Sentence: Adam McQuaid was born in Charlottetown, on the 12th of October 1986.

Encouraging readers to rape unconscious women and prey on those walking alone, the flier also suggests that \\"practice makes perfect, the more you rape the better you are at it!\\" Such guidelines are not only outrageous but also dangerous, and they promote a culture of sexual assault that has become all too prevalent on university campuses. Given the gravity of the situation, it is alarming that the university officials have been criticized for downplaying the news and sweeping it under the rug. It is the responsibility of the university to create a safe learning environment, and such actions are a betrayal of trust to their students. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. At least 27 sexual assaults have been reported on campus since 2009, with 19 of them happening in dorms. This speaks to the wider issue of sexual assault on college campuses and the need for more comprehensive measures to address this problem. It is not only up to universities to take responsibility but also up to society at large to challenge these attitudes towards sexual assault. We must collectively work towards a culture that prioritizes consent and respect for all, and we must hold those who promote or commit sexual assault accountable for their actions. In conclusion, the recent flier promoting sexual assault is a stark reminder of the current crisis we are facing. We must recognize the seriousness of this issue and work together to create a safer and more just society for everyone."},{"instruction":"f Two boys are getting help on a computer from a teacher., does this mean that two boys are on the computer doing classwork?

By taking quick and decisive action, Best was able to prevent further damages or threats to his safety, as well as aiding the police in their investigation of the crime. Additionally, Best's example shows that citizens can make a significant contribution to the fight against crime by being vigilant and proactive in protecting themselves and their property. While not everyone may feel comfortable engaging with hostile intruders, homeowners can take steps such as installing security cameras, alarms, and strong locks to deter criminals from attempting to break in. Despite the risks involved in confronting burglars, Best's actions demonstrate the potential for citizens to help reduce crime and improve safety in their communities. By working together with local law enforcement, we can take a stand against threats to our homes and families, making our neighborhoods safer and more secure for everyone."},{"instruction":"What are some example of unique names?

While there are many factors that can contribute to and worsen depression, such as stress, genetics, and trauma, research has also shown that diet can play a significant role. One key step to reducing depression is to eliminate foods that contribute to it. This includes highly processed, sugary, and refined foods that can cause inflammation and disrupt gut health. It's also important to reduce caffeine and alcohol, which can worsen symptoms of depression. Instead, focus on eating more foods that can reduce depression. The Mediterranean diet, for example, has been shown to have numerous mental health benefits. This diet includes a high intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and healthy fats like olive oil and avocado. Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids and folate can also be beneficial. Omega-3s are found in fatty fish, like salmon and tuna, as well as in chia seeds and walnuts. Folate, which is important for nerve function and mood regulation, is found in leafy greens, legumes, and fortified cereals. It's important to monitor how your diet affects your mood. Keep a food journal and record how you feel after eating certain foods. This can help you identify trigger foods and make changes to your diet accordingly.

It is recommended to limit caffeine intake to no more than 400mg per day, which is equivalent to about four cups of coffee. Lastly, avoid alcoholic drinks. While alcohol can be a social lubricant, it is important to consume it in moderation. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to dehydration, liver damage, and other health problems. It is recommended for men to have no more than 2 drinks per day, and for women to have no more than 1 drink per day. In conclusion, making healthy food and drink choices is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that you are fueling your body with the nutrients it needs to thrive. Remember, a healthy body leads to a happy life!"},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: The Vikings traveled to Kansas City to play against Matt Cassel's former team.

One tip that can help improve your rice is to let it soak for 10 to 15 minutes prior to cooking. To start, place your desired amount of rice in a colander. Make sure to rinse the rice thoroughly with water until the water runs clear. This will help remove any excess starch, dirt or debris that can make your rice sticky. Once you’ve rinsed the rice, let it soak in the water for 10 to 15 minutes. This soaking process will help the rice absorb the water and cook more evenly. Additionally, soaking rice can help remove any remaining impurities, which can promote better digestion. After 10 to 15 minutes, drain the water from the colander and transfer the rice to a pot or rice cooker. Add the appropriate amount of water based on the kind of rice you are cooking, usually a 1:2 rice to water ratio. Bring the rice to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and let it cook for the appropriate amount of time based on the type of rice (e.g. white rice takes around 18 minutes). By soaking your rice prior to cooking, you’ll find that your finished product is more fluffy and evenly cooked.

Included not acknowledging mistakes in care and inadequate apologies being offered. GPs also under fire for striking off patients.","output":"The Health Service Ombudsman has revealed that it received a startling 150,859 complaints between 2011 and 2012. A significant number of these complaints were related to issues such as not acknowledging mistakes in care and inadequate apologies being offered. In addition, GPs have also been under fire for striking off patients. The number of complaints received by the Health Service Ombudsman is troubling, as it highlights the number of patients who are dissatisfied with the care they have received. It is important for healthcare providers to acknowledge their mistakes and take responsibility for them when they occur. Failing to do so can erode patient trust and ultimately undermine the effectiveness of the entire healthcare system. One of the issues highlighted by the complaints is the lack of adequate apologies being offered. When mistakes occur, patients have a right to expect a sincere and meaningful apology. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In some instances, apologies are not offered at all, while in others they are insincere and lacking in empathy. This can add insult to injury and exacerbate the patient's anguish. Another area of concern is the striking off of patients by GPs. While there may be valid reasons for doing so, such as when a patient repeatedly misses appointments, it is essential that procedures are followed correctly and that patients are treated fairly. Patients who are arbitrarily struck off by a GP may have a legitimate complaint, and this is reflected in the number of complaints received by the Health Service Ombudsman. It is important for healthcare providers to take patient complaints seriously and to address them promptly and appropriately. When complaints are ignored or inadequately handled, they can escalate and lead to broader issues of patient mistrust and dissatisfaction. Recognizing this, healthcare providers should prioritize the proper handling of complaints as a means of improving patient satisfaction and ensuring the long-term success and effectiveness of the healthcare system."},{"instruction":"dentify the most salient words in this sentence: wagon being pulled by mule in village during a road trip km e","output":"wagon, mule, village, road trip, east"},{"instruction":"The eight books and four cartoons are available for iPad iPhone and iPod Touch Add punctuatio","output":"\\"The eight books and four cartoons are available for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.\\""},{"instruction":"it possible to conclude that Big brown and white spotted dog laying on a jacket on the street. if A dog is relaxing on a busy street after chasing a cat.?

Its original name Honovere may mean high (river)bank, though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and northwest of the Harz mountains, so that eastwest traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.

If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400 cm−1, the midinfrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad OH absorption around 3200 cm−1).

Arakan, which is located in what is now western Myanmar, was a small but wealthy kingdom that traded with both India and Southeast Asia. The Toungoo-Arakan conflict began in 1531 when Toungoo's king, Tabinshwehti, launched a campaign to annex Arakan. The Arakanese, led by King Min Bin, fiercely resisted the invasion and were able to push back the Toungoo forces. However, Toungoo did not give up and continued to launch attacks on Arakan throughout the 1530s and 1540s. In 1554, Bayinnaung, who became king of Toungoo that same year, resumed the conquest of Arakan. Like his predecessor, Bayinnaung encountered stiff resistance from the Arakanese army. Nevertheless, he was able to capture the Arakanese capital of Mrauk-U in 1556, putting an end to Arakan's independence. Despite the conquest, Arakan continued to resist Toungoo rule. In 1599, a group of Arakanese rebels, with the help of Portuguese mercenaries, launched a successful insurrection against Toungoo. They were able to regain control of Mrauk-U and establish an independent state that lasted until the Burmese conquest of Arakan in 1784.

Choose long clothing. Use netting to protect your face and neck. Try permethrintreated clothing.","output":"Protecting yourself from mosquitoes is important not only to avoid itchy bites but also to prevent serious illnesses such as malaria, Zika virus, and dengue fever. To reduce your risk of getting bitten by mosquitoes, there are a few simple steps you can take. Firstly, wear loose-fitting clothing. Tight clothing can make it easier for mosquitoes to bite through your clothes. Loose clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and pants, will provide a barrier between the mosquitoes and your skin. Secondly, choose long clothing. Mosquitoes are attracted to heat, which means they are more likely to bite exposed skin. Wearing clothing that covers your arms and legs can help reduce the number of bites. Thirdly, use netting to protect your face and neck. Mosquitoes are more likely to target your face and neck, as these areas are often exposed. Using a mosquito net around your bed or when outdoors can help keep mosquitoes away from your face. Finally, consider permethrin-treated clothing. Permethrin is a synthetic insecticide that repels and kills mosquitoes. Many outdoor clothing companies offer clothing that has been specially treated with permethrin, providing long-lasting protection against mosquito bites. By following these simple steps, you can reduce your risk of getting bitten by mosquitoes and protect yourself from the diseases they can carry.

Tory Lord is right to pursue new media aristocrats who sullied his reputation, Keen adds. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Lord Alistair McAlpine, a prominent Tory Lord in the UK, is reportedly considering legal action against Twitter users who falsely accused him of being a pedophile. The latest battle in the Twitter war has ignited a debate about the responsibility of prominent social media users for their online activities. Andrew Keen, a media commentator, has argued that Twitter users with many followers are as liable under libel law as media companies. The allegations against Lord McAlpine were made on social media sites, including Twitter, following a BBC program which suggested that a senior Conservative party member was involved in child sex abuse. The false allegations against Lord McAlpine quickly spread on Twitter, causing irreparable damage to his reputation. As a result, Lord McAlpine has instructed lawyers to investigate the false claims made against him on Twitter. He has also threatened legal action against Twitter users who retweeted or shared defamatory content related to this case. Keen has backed McAlpine's decision to pursue legal action, arguing that social media users need to be held accountable for their actions. He suggests that those with many Twitter followers are just as liable for libel as media companies. This could have significant implications for high-profile users of social media, who may be tempted to make unfounded allegations without considering the consequences of their actions. The debate over Lord McAlpine's case highlights the challenges of regulating online content, and the need to balance free speech with the protection of individuals' reputations. While social media can be a force for good, it also has the potential to spread false or defamatory content at lightning speed, causing significant harm to individuals and organizations. In conclusion, Lord McAlpine's case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of social media and the need for accountability in online activities. It highlights the importance of responsible social media use, and the need for regulations to protect individuals from online harassment and defamation."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise Situated 85 km (53 miles) northwest of Paris by the A13, D181, and D5, or by train from Gare StLazare to Vernon with a shuttle bus from the station to Giverny., can we conclude the hypothesis It can be accessed by road or train. is true?

You can also use stencils or templates to create repeatable or intricate patterns, or experiment with freehand drawing if you have artistic flair. If you are not confident in your artistic abilities, you can search for inspiration over the internet, follow tutorials or patterns, or hire a professional artist or graphic designer to help you. The key to a successful bag decoration is to work with a plan, so you can avoid mistakes or regrets later. Before you apply any permanent changes to your bag, try sketching your ideas on paper or testing them on a sample fabric or scrap material. This will help you to see how your design will look in practice, and whether you need to adjust the size, color, or placement of the elements. Once you are satisfied with your plan, you can start applying it on your bag. Take your time, and use the right materials and tools for each technique.

The movie's title is derived from this township, which is similar to the notorious District 6 of Apartheid South Africa. The movie has all the thrills and chills you expect from a top-notch sci-fi blockbuster, but it also brings a lot more to the table. It raises questions about immigration, segregation, racism, and other social issues that remain relevant today. The parallels between the aliens' confinement in District 9 and the historical oppression of black South Africans are obvious, but the movie also touches on broader themes of prejudice, exploitation, and social decay.

He was an American chemist who made an unexpected discovery during a lab accident that would impact the world for decades to come. Coover was working for Eastman Kodak at the time, where he was assigned to find a solvent for clear plastic gun sights. He experimented with cyanoacrylates, a group of chemicals that stick to skin and other substances in seconds. However, the experiment failed, and he moved on to other projects. Years later, Coover and his team were researching heat-resistant polymers for jet canopies. He revisited the cyanoacrylate experiment and found that the chemical had potential as a glue. He spent years perfecting the formula, and in 1958, Eastman Kodak introduced Super Glue to the market. Super Glue quickly became a household name due to its strength, speed, and versatility. It could bond anything from wood to metal to plastic in seconds, making it a go-to for repairs and crafts. Coover's invention also inspired the creation of many other fast-drying adhesives. Aside from being an accomplished scientist, Coover was a devoted family man. He is survived by his three children and four grandchildren. They remember him as a loving father and grandfather, who had a passion for physics, tinkering, and playing golf. In conclusion, Harry Wesley Coover Jr. left a lasting legacy with his invention of Super Glue.

Soon the conflict spilled over to other parts of the Caucasus, and on August 5, 1905, the first conflict between the Armenian and Azeri population of Shusha took place. In March 1918 ethnic and religious tensions grew and the ArmenianAzeri conflict in Baku began. Musavat and Committee of Union and Progress parties were accused of PanTurkism by Bolsheviks and their allies. Armenian and Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontations, which resulted in heavy casualties. Many Muslims were expelled from Baku or went underground. Meanwhile, the arrest of Gen. Talyshinski, the commander of the Azerbaijani division, and some of its officers—all of whom arrived in Baku on March 9—increased antiSoviet feelings among the city's Azeri population. On 30 March the Soviets, based on the unfounded report that the Muslim crew of the ship Evelina was armed and ready to revolt against the Soviets, disarmed the crew which tried to resist. This led to three days fighting,resulting in the death of up to 12,000 Azeris.

It's a confusing mess from start to finish, with wooden acting, clunky dialogue, and laughable special effects. Despite its promising source material, the film fails to capture any of the magic of the beloved animated series. The pacing is sluggish and the plot is convoluted, leaving viewers scratching their heads in bewilderment. The whitewashing of the cast is also highly problematic, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and erasing the cultural diversity of the original story. Overall, \\"The Last Airbender\\" is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved property to the big screen.
