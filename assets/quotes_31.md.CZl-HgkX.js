The invasion is known as the Confederation of Shan States' invasion of Prome. The attempted invasion lasted for approximately six months. The invasion took place in 1752, during the reign of King Alaungpaya of the Konbaung Dynasty. The Confederations of Shan States were made up of several ethnic groups such as the Tai, Mon, and Kachin. They aimed to expand their territory and dominate the surrounding areas, including Prome. The Confederations of Shan States' forces were headed by Shwe Nawrahta, a powerful Shan leader who had gained much support from other Shan princes. They had an estimated army of around 30,000 soldiers, including elephants, cavalry, and infantry. On the other hand, Prome was defended by a small force composed of only 4,000 soldiers led by General Maha Thiha Thura. The Confederations of Shan States' forces initiated the attack by besieging the city. Prome, situated on the Ayeyarwady River, was a strategic location as it served as a gateway to other parts of Myanmar. The siege lasted for several months and involved various tactics such as digging tunnels to infiltrate the city walls, launching arrows and stones, and mounting ladders to climb the walls. Despite their superior numbers, the Confederations of Shan States' forces were unable to penetrate the city's defenses. Prome's fortified walls and the bravery of its defenders proved too much for the invaders. In the end, the Confederations of Shan States' forces were forced to retreat, with many soldiers dying from injuries or illnesses. The attempted invasion of Prome by the Confederations of Shan States lasted for six months. It was an intense conflict that tested the limits of both sides.

One instrument that requires regular maintenance is the brass instrument, in particular, the valve. To start, it's crucial to be gentle with the valve. If you handle it too roughly, it can become damaged or even break, which can be costly to repair. Always hold the instrument securely, making sure not to put unnecessary pressure on the valve. Another crucial aspect of caring for your valve is to reapply oil to it regularly. This helps the valve move smoothly and prevents it from becoming stuck or squeaky. When applying the oil, be sure to use only a reputable brand and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. In addition to oiling the valve, it's also essential to wipe it down regularly. Excessive moisture and fingerprints on the valve can cause it to corrode and become tarnished. To avoid this, use a soft cloth to gently wipe down the exterior of the valve after each use. Lastly, it's important to wash your brass instrument every month. This helps to remove dirt, debris, and any moisture that may have accumulated inside. A good brass-cleaning kit is essential for this task. After thoroughly cleaning the instrument, be sure to dry it thoroughly before storing it away.

Once the water has been added, place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to high to bring the water to a boil. Remember to handle the pot with care as boiling water can be dangerous. Once the water has reached boiling point, gently add the copper wire to the pot ensuring it is not tangled or knotted. Set a timer for 10 minutes and allow the wire to boil continuously. Boiling the wire will cause any dirt or dust on its surface to dissolve, leaving it looking new and shiny. After 10 minutes have passed, turn off the heat and carefully remove the copper wire from the water using tongs or a strainer. Allow the wire to cool before handling it. It is important to note that this cleaning method should only be used for copper wire. Boiling other materials such as plastics or fabrics in water can cause damage to the material and may result in it being destroyed or unusable.

The usual design is that the camera's parameters for interpreting the sensor data values into sRGB values are fixed, and a number of different EI choices are accommodated by varying the sensor's signal gain in the analog realm, prior to conversion to digital. Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices by adjusting the sensor's signal gain in the digital realm. A few camera designs also provide EI adjustment through a choice of lightness parameters for the interpretation of sensor data values into sRGB; this variation allows different tradeoffs between the range of highlights that can be captured and the amount of noise introduced into the shadow areas of the photo.

Purchase an oar storage rack for a convenient option.","output":"When it comes to home decor, adding oars can create a rustic and nautical look to any room in your house. However, before displaying decorative oars, it's important to find a practical location for functional oars to be stored. Begin by selecting a location that is easily accessible and has enough space to accommodate both functional and decorative oars. This could be in a garage, shed, or even a spare room. Once you have found a suitable location, it's time to plan the arrangement. Consider the length of the oars and how many you have when arranging them. If you have a collection of both functional and decorative oars, it's a good idea to separate them. Functional oars are typically larger and heavier, and should be stored in a way that makes them easy to access but also out of the way. A rack that can hold the oars vertically is a great option for storage as they save space and keep the oars organized. Make sure to purchase a rack that is sturdy and durable enough to hold the weight of the oars. For decorative oars, you can get more creative with the placement. Oars can be hung horizontally along a wall using hooks or displayed in a large vase or bucket. When arranging decorative oars, mix and match different sizes and textures to add depth and interest to the display. In summary, adding oars to your home decor can be a fun and unique way to bring a nautical touch to any room. By finding a practical location for functional oars to be stored and planning the arrangement of decorative oars, you can create an eye-catching display that is both beautiful and functional. Don't forget to invest in a durable oar storage rack to make accessing your functional oars easy and convenient."},{"instruction":"Write a negative movie review.","output":"The movie was a huge disappointment.

Limit your ingestion of mercury and other toxins.","output":"Omega-3 fats are an essential part of a healthy diet as they promote brain health and reduce inflammation. However, not all sources of omega-3 fats are created equal. Cold-water, fatty fish, such as salmon, are the best sources of omega-3 fats. It's essential to choose fish that are sustainably caught, in ways that limit damage to the ocean's ecosystem. Other seafood, such as mussels, clams, and crabs, can also be a source of omega-3 fats but should be consumed in moderation. Knowing how your seafood is raised and caught is critical. The farming of seafood, whether in natural or artificial environments, can have a significant impact on the quality of the food. Fish raised in crowded and unsanitary conditions or fed an unnatural diet, can contain antibiotics and other harmful chemicals. Wild seafood can also be affected by pollutants like mercury. Seafood consumption, particularly large, predatory fish, can lead to mercury toxicity, which can damage the brain, nervous system, and kidneys. To limit exposure to toxins, it's essential to choose fish that are low in mercury. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued guidelines for fish consumption based on mercury levels, with pregnant women and young children advised to avoid certain types of fish altogether. In summary, incorporating cold-water, fatty fish and other seafood into your diet is an excellent way to boost your omega-3 intake. However, it's essential to choose your seafood wisely, based on its sustainability and level of contaminants like mercury. By following these guidelines, you can enjoy the health benefits of seafood while keeping your body safe."},{"instruction":"Please answer a question about the following article about Seattle: Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush.

Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice. The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dustbathe. A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers.

This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony's own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future. Firmware update 3.30 officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in 3D, requiring a compatible display for use. System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films.

Each game has its own set of circumstances that can influence field goal attempts, such as weather conditions or a team's offensive strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to look at each game individually in order to determine the answer to this question. One example of a game where the shortest fourth quarter field goal was noteworthy occurred in Super Bowl VII in 1973. The Miami Dolphins were leading the Washington Redskins by a score of 14-0 in the fourth quarter of the game. With just over two minutes remaining in the game, Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian attempted a 42-yard field goal. The kick was blocked by the Redskins, but Yepremian picked up the ball and attempted to throw a pass. The pass ended up being intercepted by Redskins defender Mike Bass, who returned it for a touchdown. Although the field goal attempt in Super Bowl VII was not successful, it is notable for being the shortest fourth quarter field goal attempt in a Super Bowl game. Additionally, the play that resulted from the blocked field goal attempt is one of the most infamous in Super Bowl history, earning the name \\"The Blooper\\". In another example, during a regular season game in 1984, the Chicago Bears were leading their rivals, the Green Bay Packers, by a score of 17-10 in the fourth quarter. Bears kicker Kevin Butler attempted a 19-yard field goal with just over six minutes remaining in the game, which was successful. This field goal helped the Bears secure the victory over the Packers. In conclusion, the answer to the question of how many yards was the shortest fourth quarter field goal can vary depending on the specific game being referenced. Each game has its own set of circumstances that can influence field goal attempts. However, the most noteworthy example of a short fourth quarter field goal attempt was in Super Bowl VII in 1973, when Garo Yepremian attempted a 42-yard field goal that was blocked and resulted in a touchdown for the opposing team."},{"instruction":"Premise: The headquarters at Kuala Tahan have a good range of accommodation chalets, a hostel, and a rest house plus washing facilities, restaurants, and a grocery store.

Recently, the Oakland A's began selling a t-shirt with the same 'stoaked' word on it, showcasing the popularity of Frigo's design. However, after media outlets reported on the shirt's similarity to Frigo's design, the maker of the shirt, Majestic, announced that it will be pulling the design from its online stores.

Multiply the side length by 4 to find the perimeter.","output":"To calculate the area of a square, you simply need to know the length of one of its sides. The formula for the area of a square is side length squared (A = s²), where \\"s\\" represents the length of one side. Once you have found the area of the square, you can then find the side length by taking the square root of the area. To find the perimeter of the square, you need to know the length of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, you can simply multiply the length of one side by 4 to find the perimeter. This is because the perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides (P = 4s). Knowing these formulas can be incredibly helpful in a variety of scenarios, such as when measuring the size of a room or calculating the area of a plot of land. Additionally, understanding these formulas is essential for anyone studying math or pursuing a career in fields such as architecture, engineering, or construction. In summary, remember the formula for the area of a square (A = s²), find the square root of the area to get the side length, and multiply that length by 4 to find the perimeter (P = 4s). These simple formulas can help you solve a variety of problems involving squares and rectangles."},{"instruction":"What is the subject line for this email?

The ANP is a secular political party that often comes under fire from the Taliban. The attack on Jadoon took the life of the ANP member, while leaving nine others injured. Police have stated that no one has claimed responsibility for the attack. The targeting of the ANP is not a new phenomenon. The Taliban has long been opposed to the secular party, which they view as a threat to their extremist ideology. The ANP has condemned the attack on their member, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice. The attack on Jadoon is a reminder of the ongoing violence and instability in certain regions of Pakistan. The government has made efforts to combat terrorism and extremism, but these efforts have not been enough to bring an end to the violence. The targeting of political figures like Jadoon underscores the challenges that remain in combating extremism and achieving stability. While the identity of those responsible for the attack on Jadoon remains unknown, it is clear that the work of the ANP and other secular groups is still perceived as a threat to extremist groups in Pakistan. The tragedy of Jadoon's death is a stark reminder of the dangers that those who work towards a more open and democratic society in Pakistan face.

To answer this question, we need to look at the scores of the two teams at the halfway point of the game. In most sports, halftime is the break in the middle of the game. It's an opportunity for teams to rest, recover, and strategize for the rest of the match. It's also an important point in the game because it can give us a good indication of which team is likely to win. To find out which team was leading at halftime, we need to look at the scoreboard at that point. Depending on the sport, halftime may occur after the first or second quarter (in basketball and American football), or after the first half (in soccer, rugby, and other sports). For example, in a recent basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat, the scores at halftime were Lakers 62, Heat 55. This tells us that the Lakers were leading by 7 points at halftime. Similarly, in a recent soccer match between Manchester United and Chelsea, the score at halftime was 1-0 in favor of Manchester United. This means that they were leading by one goal at halftime. In conclusion, finding out which team was leading at halftime is a simple matter of checking the scores at that point in the game.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energyintensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to fly through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.

However, it insisted on its right as a neutral party to immunity from German submarine attack, even though its ships carried food and raw materials to Britain. In 1917 the Germans resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to American entry. When the U.S declared war, the U.S. army was still small by European standards and mobilization would take a year. Meanwhile, the U.S. continued to provide supplies and money to Britain and France, and initiated the first peacetime draft. Industrial mobilization took longer than expected, so divisions were sent to Europe without equipment, relying instead on the British and French to supply them.

Report items that do not appear. Show your results as percentages.","output":"When presenting data, it's important to organize it in a clear format that is easy to understand. One of the most effective ways to do this is by using a frequency table. A frequency table is a simple way to display how many times each item appears in a dataset. To create a frequency table, first make a list of all the possible items in your dataset. Then, create a column for each item and tally up how often each item appears. For example, if you were collecting data on student test scores and the possible scores were 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100, you would create a column for each of these scores and count how many students received each score. It's also important to report any items that do not appear in your dataset. This is especially important if the missing items could have a significant impact on the overall results. For example, if you were conducting a survey on favorite ice cream flavors and nobody reported liking vanilla, it would be important to mention that in your results. Finally, when presenting your results, it's a good idea to show them as percentages. This helps to give a clearer understanding of the distribution of the data.

Orange Order marches on July 12 commemorate a historic Protestant victory in 1690.","output":"Northern Ireland Police Chief brings in 400 additional officers from Britain Following the recent riots in Belfast, the Northern Ireland police chief announced that they are bringing in 400 additional officers from Britain. The decision was made after 32 officers were injured in a single night of rioting. The trouble started when loyalists protested against a decision to bar them from a flashpoint area. The area in question is traditionally used by loyalists to hold marches on Orange Order's July 12 celebrations. These celebrations commemorate the victory of Protestants in the 1690 battle of the Boyne. However, this year, the authorities have limited the number of people who can attend due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the restrictions, loyalists tried to march in the forbidden area, leading to clashes with the police. Over 10,000 peaceful marches have been held during the marching season, showing that the vast majority of Orange Order members respect the law. However, a small minority of activists could be putting people's lives at risk by breaking COVID-19 restrictions and igniting community tensions. The additional police officers will provide extra support to the Northern Ireland police, who have already been stretched thin due to a surge in hate crimes after Brexit. The UK government hopes that the new measures will help restore calm and prevent future violence.

Once you have removed the excess moisture from the zucchini, combine it with the egg, breadcrumbs and herbs. You can use any herbs you like, such as basil, parsley, oregano or thyme. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix all the ingredients together, so they are well combined. The next step is to shape the mixture into small balls, about the size of a golf ball. You can use your hands or a cookie scoop to shape the balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a non-stick mat. Make sure there is enough space between the balls, so they don't stick together. Finally, bake the zucchini balls in a preheated oven at 375 F for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. You can serve them hot or cold, with your favorite dipping sauce or as a side dish with a salad or roasted vegetables. Zucchini balls are a perfect appetizer for a party, a game night or a family dinner. They are healthy, low-carb, and easy to make. They are also a great way to use up leftover zucchini from your garden or your local farmers market.

To calculate the percentage difference between the Salvadoran and Puerto Rican populations compared to the Mexican population, we can use the following formula: ((Mexican population - Salvadoran population) / Mexican population) x 100 = percent difference between Mexican and Salvadoran populations Applying the formula, we get: ((36.6 million - 2.5 million) / 36.6 million) x 100 = 93.2% So the Salvadoran population is approximately 93.2% less than the Mexican population. Similarly, for the Puerto Rican population, we get: ((36.6 million - 5.7 million) / 36.6 million) x 100 = 84.4% So the Puerto Rican population is approximately 84.4% less than the Mexican population.

One crucial component of a formal outfit is thigh highs attached to a garter belt. To properly put on thigh highs, there are a few steps to follow. First, put the garter belt on around your waist and make sure it is in the right position. The belt should sit comfortably on your hips, and the suspender straps should hang down. Next, put on your pantyhose carefully, pulling them up until they meet the garter belt. Once your pantyhose are in place, it’s time to attach the garter clasps to your thigh highs. Starting at the back, clip each of the four clasps onto the top of the thigh highs, ensuring the straps lie flat against your thigh. It’s essential to take a moment to adjust the fit and the clasps after they are attached. Make sure the thigh highs are sitting correctly on your legs and that the garter belt feels secure. Finally, put on your underwear. By putting on your underwear last, you prevent any fabric from getting in the way while attaching the clasps. You also avoid any accidental exposure while adjusting the belt and clasps. In summary, to put on thigh highs correctly, put on the garter belt first, followed by the pantyhose. Attach the clasps to the thigh highs and adjust as needed. Lastly, put on your underwear.

This will include bleach, a brush, a flat surface, cardboard, white chalk, and of course, a shirt to be customized. Once you have all your supplies, begin by sketching out your design on the shirt using the white chalk. This will act as a guide for when you begin applying the bleach. Make sure the shirt is on a flat surface to ensure accuracy. With your design sketched out, fold the sides of the shirt under the cardboard to protect the back from getting bleach on it. Now it's time to prepare the bleach. It's important to follow the instructions on the bleach bottle carefully and wear gloves to protect your hands. Once the bleach is ready, dip your brush into it and begin tracing the chalk lines of your design. Use steady strokes to ensure that the bleach is applied evenly to the shirt. Take your time to ensure the lines are neat and clean. Once you've finished tracing your design, let the shirt sit in the sun for at least an hour. Sunlight will help activate the bleach and create the desired effect. Make sure to keep an eye on the shirt to ensure it doesn't get over-bleached. After an hour, rinse the shirt thoroughly, and then hand wash it. Bleach can be harsh on fabrics, so make sure to hand wash the shirt rather than using a washing machine. Once it's all washed, let it dry naturally. Using bleach to customize a shirt is a fun and creative way to express individuality.

Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start. The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the Roman people among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer; the festival had to be started over.

This issue has come to the forefront following the dramatic escape of notorious criminal Redoine Faid. Faid first made headlines in the 1990s for his brazen attacks on armored trucks. Once caught, he was sentenced to a lengthy prison term. However, Faid wasn't content to spend his days behind bars. Earlier this year, he held guards at gunpoint and used explosives to burst through the doors of a prison in northern France. This wasn't his first escape attempt, but it was by far his most audacious. Law enforcement officials throughout Europe are now on the hunt for Faid. The escape artist seems to have vanished, and authorities are concerned that he could strike again at any time. The escape has sparked serious concerns about France's prison overcrowding. With so many inmates locked up together, it can be difficult for guards to maintain control. This has led to a rise in prison violence and concerns about inmates becoming radicalized. In some cases, criminals are able to take advantage of the crowded conditions to facilitate their escape, as Faid did. It's not clear what the solution to France's prison overcrowding problem might be. However, it's clear that something needs to be done to prevent other dangerous criminals from following in Faid's footsteps.

Once you have selected your medium, the next step is to write down every idea that comes to mind. This might include both big, overarching goals as well as smaller, more manageable ones.

Instead, give yourself some space to reflect on what you really want to achieve, and which goals will truly help you get there.

Phillips Jr. was one of the four survivors who managed to make it out of the wreckage alive. He suffered serious injuries and was transported to a hospital for medical attention.

The aircraft left Anchorage for a fishing trip and was carrying Stevens and a group of five other passengers when the accident occurred. The tragedy has served as a reminder of the dangers of air travel and the need for strict safety measures. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has launched an investigation into the crash to determine what went wrong and how future accidents can be prevented. In the aftermath of the tragedy, people have come together to mourn the loss of those who perished in the crash.
