It's a natural human emotion that everyone experiences, but often we try to suppress it or ignore it. However, giving yourself permission to feel sad and letting those emotions out can be a crucial step in the healing process. Here are some helpful tips on how to embrace your emotions and move forward: Release Your Emotions in a Creative Way One effective way to release your emotions is through creative expression. Whether it's painting, writing, or playing an instrument, creativity can provide an outlet for your emotions. By expressing your feelings through art or writing, you can gain a better understanding of your emotions and process them in a healthy way. Make Time for Friends and Family When you're feeling down, it's easy to isolate yourself and withdraw from social interactions. However, spending time with loved ones can help bring you out of your sadness. Spending time with friends and family can remind you of the positive aspects of your life and provide a support system during tough times. Make a Positive Change in Your Appearance Making a change in your appearance can boost your self-esteem and give you a sense of control. Whether it's a new hairstyle or a new outfit, taking care of your physical self can positively affect your mental state. Taking care of your appearance can also help you to look and feel your best, which can have a positive effect on your mood. Try Something New Trying something new can help you regain a sense of purpose and excitement in your life. Whether it's taking up a new hobby or trying a new type of cuisine, trying new things can provide a sense of adventure and exploration. This can help you to shift your focus from what you lost or what's making you sad and instead focus on what new experiences you can have in your life. Remember Who You Are When you're feeling sad or overwhelmed, it's easy to lose sight of your identity and what makes you unique. By taking time to remember who you are, you can reconnect with your values and personal identity. Whether it's through journaling, meditation or talking to a trusted friend, reflecting on your personal identity can help you regain a sense of purpose and self-worth. In conclusion, allowing yourself to feel sad and embracing your emotions is an important part of the healing process. By releasing your emotions in a creative way, spending time with loved ones, making a positive change in your appearance, trying something new, and remembering who you are, you can move forward with a renewed sense of purpose and hope."},{"instruction":"Which is this about?

First and foremost, talk to local tattoo artists to learn more about the industry and get an idea of what it takes to succeed in this field. Once you have a good understanding of what's involved, it's time to start applying for an apprenticeship. A tattoo apprenticeship is a period of training under an experienced tattoo artist, during which you'll learn the skills and techniques you'll need to become an independent tattoo artist. Be sure to research and reach out to various studios to find the right fit for you. As you work your way through your apprenticeship, it's likely that you'll also need to take on a second job to make ends meet. Tattoo apprenticeships are typically unpaid, so you'll need to have an additional source of income to cover your living expenses. Once you've found a studio and begun your apprenticeship, be sure to get your apprenticeship agreement in writing. This should outline what you'll be responsible for as an apprentice, as well as what your mentor will provide in terms of training and support. Finally, it's important to understand your initial responsibilities as an apprentice. This may include tasks such as cleaning and sterilizing equipment, maintaining the studio, and assisting with basic tasks during tattoo sessions.

Add mulch between each mound to prevent weeds. Harvest each plant when it matures. Allow the beans to decompose in the soil over the winter.","output":"Watering, mulching, harvesting, and decomposing - these are the essential steps to ensure a successful bean plot. To start with, the plot needs to be watered about 1 inch (2.5 cm) a week. This ensures that the plants receive the required moisture, which is essential for their growth and development. Once the plot has been watered, it's vital to add mulch between each mound or row. Mulching helps to prevent weeds from growing and competing for nutrients with the bean plants. It also helps to maintain soil moisture by reducing evaporation from the soil surface. Harvesting is the next crucial step in maintaining a thriving bean plot. The beans should be picked when they are mature, and this is usually indicated by the pods turning yellow or brown. It's important to harvest the beans when fully matured to ensure maximum yield and quality. After harvesting, leave the bean plants in the soil to decompose over the winter. This is known as green manure, and it helps enrich the soil by adding organic matter, improving soil structure, and providing nutrients for the next season's crop. In essence, maintaining a successful bean plot requires consistent watering, mulching, timely harvesting, and decomposing of the bean plants. Doing so helps to keep the soil healthy and ensures the highest yield and quality of the crop."},{"instruction":"the neighborhood of the house upon which we made an offer , the association had apparently declared Yard Sale Day , so I stopped at a few , but nobody was selling anything I wanted , except four old , stout dining room chairs we do n't have room for .

These actions, when combined, can help individuals achieve their financial goals and regain control of their finances. The first step towards financial success is to create a budget. This involves identifying all sources of income and categorizing expenses into fixed and variable categories. Fixed expenses include essential bills such as rent, utilities, and insurance, while variable expenses include discretionary spending such as entertainment and dining out. By tracking expenses and identifying areas where there is overspending, individuals can make informed decisions about where to cut back and save money. Earning more money is another effective way to improve your financial situation. This can be done by taking on additional work or finding a higher-paying job. Other opportunities to earn more money include selling unused items, providing freelance services, or investing in stocks, bonds, or real estate. Earning more money can help individuals lay the foundation for a strong financial future. Trimming expenses is another crucial step towards financial stability. This involves reducing unnecessary expenses to free up cash for savings or debt repayment. Simple ways to trim expenses include avoiding impulse purchases, cooking at home instead of eating out, and opting for generic or store-brand products instead of name-brand ones. Eliminating recurring expenses for services you no longer use can also help you save money. In conclusion, creating a budget, earning more money, and trimming expenses are three essential steps towards achieving financial stability. By following these steps consistently, individuals can save money, pay off debts, and achieve their financial goals.

This occurred on September 15, 1918, during World War I. The Ottoman forces were able to quickly overpower the small British and Azerbaijani forces that were defending the city, and they entered victorious. The fall of Baku was a significant moment in the war, as it marked the end of the short-lived Baku Commune, a Bolshevik government that had been established in the city just a few months earlier. The Ottoman capture of the city also gave them control of the rich oil fields in the region, which they used to fuel their war effort. The evacuation of the city had been ordered by Dunsterville, a British general who had been sent to the region to support the anti-Bolshevik forces. His decision to evacuate the city was controversial, as many believed that the British forces should have stayed and continued to defend the city. However, Dunsterville believed that it was necessary to evacuate in order to prevent unnecessary casualties and ensure that the British forces could regroup elsewhere. Despite the controversy surrounding the evacuation, it is clear that Dunsterville's decision saved many lives. The Ottoman forces entered the city just two days after the evacuation, and had the British forces stayed and fought, it is likely that many more soldiers and civilians would have been killed or captured. In conclusion, the Ottoman Army of Islam and its Azeri allies entered Baku just two days after Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city. This event marked the end of the Baku Commune and gave the Ottoman forces control of the region's valuable oil fields. While the decision to evacuate was controversial at the time, it ultimately saved many lives and allowed the British forces to regroup and fight another day."},{"instruction":"ere is a dialogue: Gabe: how much for the uber?

The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the top and bottom of each side of each segment. The parapodia (limbs) of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips – for example jointed, comblike or hooked. Chetae are made of moderately flexible βchitin and are formed by follicles, each of which has a chetoblast (hairforming) cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta. The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli, fine hairlike extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta. When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta. Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae (bristles) of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid αchitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle.

While identity is a volatile, flexible and abstract 'thing', its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view. Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language, dress, behaviour and choice of space, whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings. Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers, their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning. In a social context, misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers. Equally, an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply unanswerable): What do markers help create?","output":"Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers."},{"instruction":"f A girl in a bikini top stands in front of a beautiful view., does it logically follow that A beautiful view with a girl in a bikini?

Former United player Gary Neville defended the Dutch striker.","output":"Manchester United's forward, Robin van Persie, was spotted showing off his impressive skills on the streets of Manchester. The Dutch striker was taking part in filming for a TV show and his son Shaqueel accompanied him. Despite struggling for goals this season, Van Persie proved that he still has a few tricks up his sleeve. He pulled off flicks and tricks with ease, showcasing his agility and technical prowess. The 31-year-old has been criticized for his lack of form in front of goal, but this display will go some way to silencing his critics. Former Manchester United player, Gary Neville, has defended Van Persie in the past. Neville has praised the striker's professionalism and work ethic, insisting that he is a valuable asset to the team. Van Persie's skills on the street highlight his love for the game and his commitment to improving his skills. Van Persie's son, Shaqueel, was also involved in the filming. It's clear that the love of football runs in the family and Shaqueel will no doubt be following in his father's footsteps. It's heartwarming to see a father and son sharing a passion and bonding over a game that they both love. In conclusion, Robin van Persie's street football skills may not have any direct impact on his form on the pitch, but they serve to remind us of the passion and dedication that drives him. Gary Neville's defense of the striker is apt, and we can hope that Van Persie's performances will pick up as the season progresses."},{"instruction":"@amieewhitney I mean...it just sucks either way...

Squires initially told Sussex Police that he hadn't been involved in a crash, but had simply been doing a U-turn. However, things soon took a turn for the worse for Squires. He admitted that the car had an \\"old injury,\\" and that he had also had a few drinks earlier that day, although he insisted that he wasn't drunk. Adding to his problems, Squires also revealed that he didn't have a licence, only a provisional one. The combination of broken car parts, alcohol consumption and driving without a full licence was obviously a cause for concern for the police, and Squires was subsequently banned from driving for a period of 20 months. It's easy to see why the police would take such a harsh stance in this case. Squires' admission that he had consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel is worrying, particularly given his lack of a full driving licence. It's also clear that the condition of his vehicle wasn't safe for the road, and in the interests of public safety, it's right that action was taken to keep Squires off the roads for a period of time. Of course, this case is a reminder to all drivers of the importance of ensuring that their vehicles are roadworthy and safe to drive, as well as the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol.

Install masonry screws. Use an adhesive substance. Complete professional jobs with a powderactuated tool.","output":"Hanging pictures on brick walls has always been a daunting task. Boring holes into bricks can weaken the structure and lead to further troubles. Fortunately, there are several ways of hanging pictures on brick walls without using holes. The most common option is to install hole-free brick clamps. These clamps can easily be mounted on the wall without the need for any drilling. Place the picture frame into the clamp and slide it into the desired position. Another option is to use masonry screws. These screws can be drilled into the brick without causing any damage. However, it is important to note that there are specific screws designed for use on masonry, which are different from those designed for use on drywall or wood. If you are looking for a more permanent solution, an adhesive substance may be the ideal choice. Brick adhesives are strong and durable, and can reliably hold a heavyframe. However, it is important to select an adhesive that is specially formulated for use on brick.

Take the bus. Ride the rails. Walk or bike to work.","output":"The daily commute to work can be a stressful and time-consuming task that can drain your energy before you even reach your workplace. However, there are several alternative transportation methods that can help relieve some of the burden, save you time and money, and even benefit the environment. Carpooling is a great option for those who live near each other and work in the same or a nearby location. Sharing a ride with coworkers or friends not only reduces the cost of fuel and parking, but also is a great way to connect with others and reduce traffic congestion on the road. Additionally, some employers offer incentives such as preferred parking or reduced rates for carpooling. Taking public transportation such as the bus or train is another practical option for those who live in urban areas with accessible transit systems. Public transportation can save you money on fuel and parking expenses and is also a more environmentally friendly way to commute. Many transit systems offer monthly passes or discounted rates for regular riders, making it a cost-effective option for daily commuters. For those who live within a reasonable distance from their workplace, walking or biking to work is a healthy and sustainable transportation option. Regular exercise can improve your physical and mental wellbeing while reducing your carbon footprint. If your workplace is too far to reach entirely by foot or bicycle, consider combining your commute with public transportation or carpooling. In conclusion, there are various alternative transportation options for your daily work commute that save you time, money, and improve your overall wellbeing.

Consider your job requirements or lifestyle before purchasing a suit - if you do not frequently attend formal events or work in a corporate environment, you may not need a suit at all. Assuming that a suit is the right choice for you, the next step is to choose between a skirt or pants. This decision will largely depend on your personal style and comfort level. If you prefer a more traditional, classic look, a skirt suit may be the way to go. On the other hand, if you are more comfortable in pants or prefer a more modern, edgy look, a pants suit could be the better choice. Once you've decided on the style, it's time to choose the color. While there are endless color options available, three classic colors stand out: charcoal grey, navy blue, and black. Charcoal grey is a versatile and sophisticated choice that is appropriate for a variety of occasions, from weddings to job interviews. Navy blue is another timeless option that exudes confidence and professionalism. Finally, a black suit is a classic choice for formal events such as weddings or black tie galas. Ultimately, the choice of suit color depends on your personal preference, as well as the dress code of the event or workplace. It's also worth considering the season and the overall look you are trying to achieve. A charcoal grey suit may be better suited for fall or winter, while a navy blue suit can work well in any season. In summary, before purchasing a suit, it's crucial to consider your lifestyle and needs. If a suit is necessary, choose between a skirt or pants based on your personal style and comfort level. Then, select a classic color such as charcoal grey, navy blue, or black that will work for a variety of occasions.

Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the Frankfurt School, thinkers like Herbert Marcuse, Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Jürgen Habermas combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a return to Hegel. Within the (post) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Claude Lefort, and Jean Baudrillard. The Situationists were more influenced by Hegel; Guy Debord, in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Fortunately, the process isn't too difficult and can be done with some simple supplies. First, you'll want to give the mask, tubing, and headgear a weekly bath. To do this, fill a sink or basin with warm water and gentle soap. Take apart the mask and remove the headgear, then soak these items in the water for at least 30 minutes. While they're soaking, you can use a tube cleaning brush to clean out the tubing. Make sure to get into all the crevices to fully remove any bacteria or other debris. After soaking, rinse everything in clear water and set aside to air dry. Next, hang up the tubing to ensure water drips out. You can simply hang the tubing over a shower rod or towel bar, making sure it's able to fully drain. This will help prevent any water from getting into your machine and causing damage. Once everything is dry, wipe down the non-disposable filter. This can typically be found on the back of your CPAP machine and should be cleaned on a regular basis. Use a damp cloth to wipe away any dust or debris, then allow the filter to dry completely before reinserting it into the machine. Finally, reassemble your machine and check for leaks. This is an important step, as leaks can not only reduce the effectiveness of your CPAP, but can also cause discomfort or even skin irritation. Turn on your machine and make sure everything is working as it should. You can also adjust the straps on the headgear if necessary to ensure a comfortable fit. By following these steps on a regular basis, you'll be able to keep your CPAP machine clean and functioning properly. This will not only improve your quality of sleep, but also help you avoid any potential health problems caused by dirty equipment."},{"instruction":"Data: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

With the right tools and following a few simple steps, you can create your own custom wood plugs and install them seamlessly. First, acquire the plugs that you will be using. You can either purchase pre-made plugs or make your own using a plug cutter. After acquiring the plugs, test your counterbore and plug on a scrap piece of wood before using it on your actual project. Next, drill a shallow counterbore in the location where you want to install the plug. This will create a space for the plug to sit flush with the surface of the wood. Make sure that the counterbore is just deep enough to house the plug. After creating the counterbore, drill a pilot hole for the screw in the center of the counterbore. This will ensure that the screw goes into the wood at the right angle and doesn’t split the wood. Now you can drive the screw into the wood and down to the bottom of the counterbore. Once the screw is in place, you can insert the plug into the counterbore. Hammer the plug in tightly until it’s flush with the surface of the wood.

Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food simple ingredients so not much you can do wrong. Quite frankly, the worst tasting Chicken Shawarma I have ever tasted.

The shredded lettuce likely came from the same vendor McDonalds has, and I don't recall much else except the flavorless echo of a yogurtbased tzaziki.

Here are some easy steps to maintain your vacuum cleaner. Firstly, empty the dust canister of your vacuum cleaner before and after each vacuuming session. This will ensure that the dust and debris collected during cleaning sessions do not clog the canister or affect the vacuum's suction power. Secondly, replace your vacuum's dust bag when it reaches 3/4 of its capacity. A full dust bag will affect the vacuum's performance and may cause the dust to spill back into your home. So it's essential to replace it regularly. Thirdly, rinse the washable filters in your vacuum cleaner once a month. This will help to remove the accumulated dirt and debris from the filters, ensuring the airflow is not hindered. When cleaning the filters, ensure that they are completely dry before you put them back into the vacuum. Additionally, replace HEPA or disposable filters about two times a year. The HEPA filter traps lower levels of dust and allergens; it is essential to keep this filter clean and replace it when it is no longer working optimally.

Regular cleaning of your filters and canister, along with timely replacement of dust bags and filters, will ensure that your vacuum is always performing well, with optimal suction power and airflow."},{"instruction":"Write a positive movie review.","output":"This movie is an absolute delight to watch from start to finish.

The trial of Jeffrey Pyne was a closely watched case, with many people interested in the outcome of the trial. During the trial, evidence was presented that suggested that Jeffrey had a strained relationship with his mother and that there were frequent arguments between the two of them. Despite the evidence presented during the trial, Jeffrey maintained his innocence and denied any involvement in his mother's death. His defense team argued that there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime, and that the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence. In the end, the jury found Jeffrey guilty of second-degree murder, a lesser charge than the first-degree murder charge that had been sought by the prosecution.

Drug salesman convicted of promoting uses not approved by FDA for a legal drug. Frum: But doctors often use drugs offlabel; court said it's free speech to discuss. By trying to protect public, he says, FDA risks depriving doctors of good information. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A recent court ruling in the United States may drastically open up the free speech rights of drug companies when it comes to promoting drugs that have not yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This ruling comes after a drug salesman was convicted of promoting a drug for uses that had not yet been approved by the FDA. However, as political commentator David Frum points out, doctors frequently use drugs “off-label” for purposes that have not yet been approved by the FDA. The court ruled that discussing these potential uses of drugs is a form of free speech, and Frum argues that by trying to protect the public, the FDA may actually be depriving doctors of important information that could lead to better patient outcomes. While there is certainly cause for concern about the potential dangers of using drugs off-label, Frum suggests that we must also consider the benefits. As he notes, “medications are not invented just for the conditions they are initially approved for. And often, we learn about new uses for drugs only after they have been on the market for some time.” In other words, doctors may discover new uses for a drug that were not initially anticipated by the FDA. By restricting discussions of these uses, the FDA may be limiting doctors’ ability to provide better care for their patients. Of course, there are risks associated with using drugs off-label. Some drugs may have side effects or interactions that are not yet fully understood, especially when used for purposes that have not yet been fully researched. However, Frum suggests that the benefits of discussing off-label uses may ultimately outweigh the risks. At the end of the day, this ruling raises important questions about the role of free speech in the healthcare industry. While we must balance the risks of using drugs off-label against the potential benefits, we must also ensure that doctors are able to freely discuss new and innovative treatments with their patients. As Frum puts it, “the FDA should not be in the business of suppressing information that doctors need to give their patients truly informed consent.”"},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

He first suggests that greater priority should be given to sexual arousal and attraction over behaviour and identity because it is less prone to self and otherdeception, social conditions and variable meanings. To measure attraction and arousal he proposed that biological measures should be developed and used. There are numerous biological/physiological measures that exist that can measure sexual orientation such as sexual arousal, brain scans, eye tracking, body odour preference, and anatomical variations such as digitlength ratio and right or left handedness. Secondly, SavinWilliams suggests that researchers should forsake the general notion of sexual orientation altogether and assess only those components that are relevant for the research question being investigated.

According to Monkhouse, magistrates were instructed by the Courts & Tribunals Service not to engage with adult defendants to find out more information about their backgrounds before passing sentence. Monkhouse's comments highlight the growing concern among legal professionals that the justice system is failing to address the root causes of criminal behavior. By not taking the time to understand the circumstances and influences that may have led a defendant to commit a crime, magistrates may be missing important opportunities to provide appropriate sentences that address the underlying issues. While this approach may seem efficient, it can ultimately lead to ineffective and counterproductive sentences. Without taking the time to understand the various factors that may have contributed to a defendant's criminal behavior, the courts may end up imposing penalties that do not actually address the underlying causes of the crime. Monkhouse's call for increased engagement with defendants underscores the importance of treating individuals who enter the criminal justice system with compassion and empathy. By taking the time to understand their unique situations, judges and magistrates can work to create sentences and rehabilitation plans that address the root causes of criminal behavior, rather than simply punishing offenders. Ultimately, if the courts fail to engage with defendants in a meaningful way, the overall justice system will continue to suffer. It is therefore critical that we take Monkhouse's comments seriously and work to ensure that every defendant is given the chance to have their story heard and understood before a sentence is passed."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"So grateful for the beautiful weather today and the opportunity to spend time with loved ones.

However, finding the right fit can sometimes be a challenge. Fortunately, there is a simple solution to ensure that your jeans fit perfectly. The first step is to put on a well-fitting pair of jeans to get an idea of the shape you want. This will give you a good idea of how your new jeans should fit on your body. It's important to have a clear picture of what you want your jeans to look like before you start sewing. Once you've identified the shape you want, try on your new jeans to see if they fit. This is the most important step in ensuring the perfect fit. Make sure the jeans feel comfortable and look the way you want them to. If they are too loose or too tight in certain areas, mark those spots with a fabric pen. Finally, go over the seam again with a much shorter stitch. This will ensure that the seams are strong and durable, and will help your jeans last longer. It's important to take your time with this step, as it will make all the difference in how your finished product looks. In conclusion, achieving the perfect fit for your jeans is easier than you might think. With these simple steps, you can ensure that your jeans fit comfortably and look great.

It can also serve as a tool for applying foundation, eye shadow, and concealer, providing a seamless finish and longer staying power. One of the best ways to use setting spray is by dampening your foundation sponge or beauty blender. This helps to evenly distribute the foundation on your face, making it easier to blend and preventing streakiness. Simply spray a few pumps of setting spray on your sponge and dab it onto your foundation before application. Another way to make use of setting spray is by spraying it directly onto your eye shadow brush. This helps to intensify the color of the shadow, making it more pigmented and longer-lasting. It also helps to prevent fallout, which can be especially helpful for glittery or shimmery shadows. Lastly, spritzing your under-eye concealer brush with setting spray can help to prevent creasing and increase the longevity of your concealer. This technique works best with a dampened beauty sponge, as it helps to blend the concealer seamlessly into your skin while keeping it in place.

Over his storied career, Brees threw a total of 571 touchdown passes, which is the most by any quarterback in NFL history except for Tom Brady. While the total number of touchdown passes is impressive, it is equally interesting to explore how long each of these touchdown passes was. In other words, how many yards did Drew Brees throw the ball to score a touchdown? To answer this question, we can turn to statistical records of Drew Brees's career. According to data compiled by Pro-Football-Reference, the average length of a touchdown pass thrown by Brees was 19.6 yards. However, this figure doesn't tell the whole story. In some seasons, Brees was particularly adept at throwing long touchdown passes, while in others, his scoring tosses tended to be shorter. For instance, during the 2009 season, Brees threw a total of 34 touchdown passes, with an average length of 18.8 yards. However, in the 2011 season, he threw fewer touchdown passes (46) but with a longer average length of 22.5 yards. Overall, it is remarkable that a single quarterback could throw so many touchdown passes over such a long period of time. While some of these scoring tosses were short and efficient, others were long bombs that showcased Brees's incredible arm strength and accuracy. Regardless of the distance of each touchdown pass, however, there's no doubt that Drew Brees's performance on the field will continue to be remembered as one of the greatest in NFL history."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Pietersen will return to action for Surrey in Friday night's match with Essex.

The news of Pietersen's impending return has been making headlines for some time now, and fans of the batsman have been eagerly awaiting his comeback. In fact, Surrey even posted a video of Pietersen padding up in the dressing room on social media, which only added to the excitement. Pietersen is a seasoned campaigner, and his presence will no doubt be a big boost to Surrey's chances of coming out on top in Friday night's game. The batsman has always been known for his aggressive style of play and his ability to take on any bowler, irrespective of the conditions.

On December 5th, 2010, playing for the Minnesota Vikings against the Buffalo Bills, Favre threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings in the third quarter of the game. The pass broke the previous record of 98 yards held by quarterbacks Tom Brady and Jim Hart. Favre's powerful arm and accuracy were well-known throughout his career, and this stunning pass was a testament to his skills as a quarterback. Favre retired after the 2010 season, but his record-breaking pass remains a highlight of his storied career. It is worth noting that while Favre's pass is the longest in NFL history, it is not the longest pass ever thrown in a football game. That honor belongs to quarterback Alex Tanney, who threw a 109-yard touchdown pass during a Division III college football game in 2011. However, Tanney's pass took place at a lower level of competition than the NFL and therefore is not considered an official record by the league. In conclusion, Brett Favre holds the record for the longest pass ever thrown in an NFL game with a 99-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings in 2010. His impressive achievement is a testament to his incredible skill as a quarterback and remains a highlight of his legendary career."},{"instruction":"Jess: Hey guys, would you like to go and grab some food?
