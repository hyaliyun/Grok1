This means that the 25 to 44 age group is around 22 million people larger than the 45 to 64 age group. This disparity in size between the two age groups can be attributed to a few different factors. First, the 25 to 44 age group represents the peak childbearing years for women, so there are typically more people in this age range due to the natural increase in birth rates. Additionally, the 45 to 64 age group includes the tail end of the Baby Boomer generation, which has now begun to age out of this range and into the 65 and older range. It's worth noting that while the 25 to 44 age group is currently larger than the 45 to 64 age group, this may not always be the case. As the Baby Boomer generation continues to age and pass away, the 45 to 64 age group will likely become smaller, while other age groups may grow larger. However, for the time being, the 25 to 44 age group is the larger of these two groups."},{"instruction":"What color compliments artichoke green color? What are complementary colours to orange?

Small variations in resistivity along the filament cause hot spots to form at points of higher resistivity; a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life. These hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, which increases the resistance at that point—this creates a positive feedback that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthylooking filament. Irving Langmuir found that an inert gas, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation.

Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return unanswerable): Which type of alloys can decrease stairstep irregularities in light bulb filaments?","output":"Different alloys of tungsten and rhenium can be used to decrease \\"stairstep\\" irregularities in light bulb filaments."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: The security guard has been suspended after she did not spot a fake bomb.

OPTIONS: And before you take any direction in your life toward finding someone to be happy in, it's important to clarify your own expectations. Accept that you may have strong differences.

That doesn't mean it's not right for you to pursue your dreams. If you find yourself in a fight with your partner, this is not a good sign. For example, your friend (or friends) may not be able to commit to you or proposal things that don't go their way.

This has resulted in increased traffic congestion, longer drive times, and heightened carbon emissions. Given the gravity of this situation, we propose a Parking & Mass Transit Resolution that would offer alternative modes of transportation to reduce the number of cars on the roads. This resolution aims to promote the use of mass transit, bikes, and pedestrian walkways, with the objective of decreasing traffic congestion and inner-city parking demand. We recommend the following measures to address the parking shortage: - Expansion of public transportation services - Installation of bike racks at key locations and public transit stations - Promotion of carpooling as a more sustainable transportation choice We believe that the implementation of this resolution will not only alleviate the parking issue but will also foster more sustainable and environmentally-friendly lifestyles in our community.

The incident occurred in one of the most strategic waterways in the world, holding up traffic through the canal in both directions. The accident has raised concerns about the safety of shipping in the canal, which is an essential link for global trade. The Suez Canal handles over 10% of the world's seaborne trade, including oil from the Middle East to Europe, and goods from Asia to the Middle East and Europe. As a result of the collision, both vessels involved have been parked in the canal lakes in Suez while authorities investigate what exactly happened. The inquiry seeks to determine the events that led to the accident and ensure better safety measures to prevent it from happening again in the future. The incident follows a similar accident on one of the world's other vital waterways, the Panama Canal. A vessel carrying grain from the United States collided with a tanker carrying empty containers to China, causing a delay in the transit of ships through the canal. The events remind us of the crucial role that waterways like the Suez and Panama can play in the global supply chain. The delays caused by these incidents can impact the timely delivery of essential goods and add significant costs to the industry. Therefore, it is vital to ensure the safety of these channels and, if necessary, take steps to modernize the technology used to guide ships through them. In conclusion, the collision between the MV Colombo Express and the MV Maersk Tanjong highlights the importance of safety in global trade. As authorities investigate further, we can only hope that incidents like this will not happen again in the future. For now, it is a reminder that we must continue to prioritize safety in our increasingly interconnected world."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: The Punter food French","output":"The data provided indicates that the Punter food is French cuisine."},{"instruction":"am totally addicted to this show. i can't wait till the week goes by to see the next showing. it's a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show. i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my vcr set to tape monarch cove. simon rex is the best actor on the show. it is suspenseful and exciting. i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it. i saw the very first episode and actually i wasn't going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now it's my favorite show. i am really mean it.

In response to this ongoing issue, a spokesman for the administration recently announced their \\"zero tolerance\\" policy on domestic abuse. This statement comes after a spate of players' arrests on charges of domestic abuse. One of the recent cases involves Arizona Cardinals running back, Jonathan Dwyer, who was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly assaulting his wife. This incident is particularly disturbing because it involves not only a professional athlete but also a spouse. Another case that highlights the issue of domestic violence in the NFL is the release of Chris Rainey by the Arizona Cardinals. Rainey was accused of slapping his girlfriend, which led to his release from the team. These incidents are just a few among many that have plagued the NFL over the past few years. The league's response to these allegations has been mixed, with some feeling they have not gone far enough to address the issue. The NFL has implemented a number of policies to address domestic abuse, but it is clear that more needs to be done. Players who are accused of domestic violence should face serious consequences, including suspension or expulsion from the league altogether. The league should also provide more resources to victims of domestic violence, including counseling services, and take proactive steps to address any potential problems before they escalate. In conclusion, the NFL's \\"zero tolerance\\" policy on domestic abuse is a step in the right direction, but more can be done to address this serious issue. It is essential that the league takes a strong stance against all forms of domestic violence and works to create a safe environment for both players and their loved ones."},{"instruction":"What is the best generalization statement about clowns?

These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared lightemitting diodes (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam. The beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to encode the data. The receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light.

Rub your new paste onto the area you'd like to exfoliate using small circular motions. Leave the paste on for 510 minutes, then gently rinse off.","output":"Baking soda is a versatile ingredient that has been used for many purposes in households. But did you know that it can also be used for facial exfoliation? Exfoliation is an important step in any skincare routine. It removes dead skin cells, unclogs pores, and promotes skin cell regeneration, resulting in smoother, brighter, and healthier-looking skin. While many exfoliating products are available in the market, they can be quite expensive and sometimes contain harsh chemicals. Using baking soda for exfoliation is an affordable, natural, and effective alternative. Baking soda is a mild abrasive that gently buffs away dead skin cells without causing irritation. It also has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help treat acne and calm redness and inflammation. To use baking soda for exfoliation, you can mix it with your regular face wash or a small amount of water to create a paste. Use small circular motions to rub the paste onto your skin, paying extra attention to areas of concern like the nose, chin, and forehead. Be gentle and avoid scrubbing too hard, as this can cause micro-tears in the skin. Leave the baking soda paste on for 5-10 minutes to allow it to penetrate the skin and work its exfoliating magic. Then, gently rinse it off with lukewarm water and pat your skin dry with a towel. Finish the routine with your favorite moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated and supple. It's important to note that while baking soda is generally safe for most skin types, it can be too harsh for extremely sensitive or dry skin. If you're unsure whether baking soda is suitable for your skin, you can do a patch test first by applying a small amount on your inner arm and waiting for any adverse reactions. In conclusion, baking soda is a simple yet effective ingredient for exfoliation that can easily be incorporated into your skincare routine. It's natural, affordable, and gentle on the skin, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to achieve smoother and healthier-looking skin.

According to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that huntergatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more leisure than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well. Their affluence came from the idea that they were satisfied with very little in the material sense. Later, in 1996, Ross Sackett performed two distinct metaanalyses to empirically test Sahlin's view. The first of these studies looked at 102 timeallocation studies, and the second one analyzed 207 energyexpenditure studies. Sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work, on average, about 6.5 hours a day, where as people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average 8.8 hours a day.

The draft defense budget has reportedly increased by 67.6 billion yuan from 2010. This announcement indicates a continuation of China's ongoing efforts to modernize its military and assert itself as a global superpower. The defense budget increase is not unexpected, as China has been investing heavily in its military infrastructure and capabilities in recent years. As tensions with the United States and other countries in the region have risen, China has sought to bolster its military readiness and expand its influence around the world. The increased defense spending will likely have important implications for China's relationships with its neighbors, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Many countries in the region are already concerned about China's growing military power, and this new announcement is likely to alarm them further. According to the report, defense spending currently accounts for 6% of China's total budget.

A few small changes in your daily habits can make a significant impact. If your college offers a meal plan, use it to its fullest extent. Rather than eating out or ordering in, commit to eating in your dorm room or at the dining hall. This can help you be mindful of your spending and limit unnecessary expenses. If you enjoy socializing, opt to attend parties rather than hosting them. Throwing a party can quickly add up in costs, especially if you're providing food, drinks or decorations. Instead, take advantage of campus events or go out with friends to make the most of your social life without breaking the bank. Consider ditching the car, if possible, and use public transportation or a bike to get around. This can help you avoid expenses such as gas, car registration, and insurance. While purchasing a car may seem like a great idea at first, the long-term costs can add up quickly. Books can be a significant expense during college. Consider buying used or renting books instead of purchasing new ones. Many college campuses have bookstores that offer these services, or you can search online for affordable options. If you're living off-campus, splitting rent with other roommates can help you save money. Sharing living expenses can make living off-campus more affordable and allow you to save money for other necessities.

Additionally, making a meal plan and sticking to a budget can help you determine what groceries to buy and avoid overspending.

Sulfur combines readily with iron to form iron sulfide, which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel.

Conversely, otherwise puremetals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called impure metals and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form metal oxides; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using fluxes, chemical additives, or other methods of extractive metallurgy.

Lanza went room-to-room at the school firing a Bushmaster assault rifle. Police are investigating whether he may have been inspired by a violent video game.

The terrorist organization has been operating in Somalia for several years now and has gained a reputation for its brutal methods, including suicide bombings and executing civilians. The UN and other international entities have been working to provide relief and stability in Somalia and other African countries for years, making attacks such as this all the more disheartening. It is unclear what the motive behind this particular attack was or how it will affect future UN operations in Somalia. In the wake of continuing violence by extremist organizations such as Al-Shabaab, it is crucial that the UN and other global entities remain vigilant in their efforts to combat terrorism and bring peace to unstable regions. The loss of life in this recent attack is a reminder of the work still to be done to ensure the safety and security of all individuals affected by these senseless acts of violence."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

This followed the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Despite this ruling, schools in Chapel Hill remained segregated until the late 1960s. In 1966, a plan was put forward by the Chapel Hill Board of Education to fully integrate the schools. This was a significant moment in the history of the town, which had a long tradition of racial segregation. The plan was met with some resistance from the community, particularly from white parents who were concerned about the impact of integration on their children's education. However, the plan went ahead, and the schools gradually became desegregated over the following years. This was not without its challenges, and there were some instances of tension and conflict as the different communities came together. Nevertheless, the integration of the schools was an important milestone in the fight for civil rights in Chapel Hill and beyond. Today, the schools in Chapel Hill and the wider region are fully integrated, and students of all races and backgrounds learn side by side. While there is still work to be done to ensure that all students have equal access to education and opportunities, the integration of the schools in 1966 was an important step forward in the fight for equality and justice."},{"instruction":"ere is a question about this article: Madonna embarked on the Confessions Tour in May 2006, which had a global audience of 1.2 million and grossed over 193.7 million, becoming the highestgrossing tour to that date for a female artist.

Similarly, if a team kicks a field goal after completing a 15-yard pass, then the team would be awarded three points. In high school and college football, the value of a touchdown is also six points.

Biden has missed only one joint session of Congress in 6 years when he was out of the country, but might not show up for Benjamin Netanyahu.

Some senior congressional Democrats are considering a boycott of the speech in order to embarass Netanyahu and the GOP. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Republican House Speaker John Boehner’s invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress has stirred up controversy. The address is scheduled for March 3 and is expected to focus on Iran and the current state of negotiations over its nuclear program. The invitation has put Vice President Joe Biden in an interesting position. As the constitutional “president” of the US Senate, Biden is also able to cast deciding votes in 50-50 ties. Normally seen sitting behind President Obama during State of the Union addresses, Biden has only missed one joint session of Congress in the last six years – during which he was out of the country. However, it is unclear whether he will show up for this particular speech. Netanyahu is expected to ask Congress to impose new sanctions on Iran, a move that the White House has warned would derail nuclear negotiations. As a result, some senior congressional Democrats are considering boycotting the speech in order to embarrass Netanyahu and the GOP. The controversy surrounding the invitation has highlighted the ongoing tension between the White House and Congress over US policy toward Iran. Critics have accused Boehner of trying to undermine the Obama administration’s foreign policy agenda by giving a platform to Netanyahu, who has been critical of the current negotiations with Iran. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Netanyahu’s visit comes just weeks before Israeli elections. Critics have accused the prime minister of using the address to boost his own political standing at home. Overall, the situation underscores the complex relationship between the US and Israel, as well as the ongoing negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program. With the speech still several weeks away, there is likely to be much more speculation and debate over what will happen when Netanyahu takes the stage before Congress."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = more than £30, customer rating = low, near = Express by Holiday Inn.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful broodrearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extrapair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extrapair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extrapair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.

The 46-year-old first noticed her hearing was decreasing in April 2012. Her symptoms progressed, and she began to experience constant ringing in her left ear. Soon after, she started to hear robotic sounds, similar to the voice of the Daleks from the popular TV show \\"Doctor Who,\\" when people spoke to her. Katie quickly sought medical attention and underwent treatment to reduce the tumor's size. Her doctors used a special treatment that involved blasting radiation at the tumor to shrink it. Despite her diagnosis, Katie remains positive and is grateful for the support of her doctors and loved ones. She knows that the benign nature of her tumor is a blessing, but she also understands the importance of constant monitoring since the growth is still present, and the tumor's location poses potential risks.

He was arrested after just three weeks in office. Cammarano pleaded guilty in April to conspiracy and extortion.","output":"Peter Cammarano III – Hoboken's Once Youngest Mayor – Falls from Grace Peter Cammarano III was once a beacon of hope for the Hoboken community. At 32, he was the youngest mayor the city had ever seen. But his tenure was short-lived. After just three weeks in office, Cammarano was arrested, charged with conspiracy and extortion. Cammarano's fall from grace was swift and shocking, particularly for the residents of Hoboken who had voted for him just a few short weeks prior. The charges against him were serious, and they rocked the community. Cammarano, who had campaigned on a platform of change and progress, was now facing the possibility of spending years behind bars. In April, Cammarano pleaded guilty to both charges. His legal team attempted to argue that he had been the victim of entrapment and had only made the statements that led to his arrest because he had been pressured by an undercover FBI agent. However, the evidence against him was overwhelming, and ultimately, he chose to plead guilty rather than face a trial. The fallout from Cammarano's arrest and subsequent guilty plea has been significant. The residents of Hoboken feel let down, and the city's political landscape has been forever changed. It is a stark reminder that even those who seem to have the best of intentions can be brought down by their own greed and corruption. Cammarano's story is a cautionary tale for politicians and citizens alike. It is a reminder of the importance of accountability and transparency in government, and the dangers of allowing one's personal interests to override the needs of the community. As Hoboken moves forward, it will undoubtedly continue to grapple with the fallout from Cammarano's actions.
