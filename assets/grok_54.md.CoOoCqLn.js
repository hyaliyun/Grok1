The legendary Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] did not save the world by introducing chakra [Naruto] to the world in the hopes of people getting to know each other, but [the sage] instead doomed it to be forever trapped in feudalism and mythicism, as the fall of the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal monarchial Kingdom of Lescatie [Monster Girl Encyclopedia] to the monster girls just before the Sage [Naruto] gave chakra [Naruto] to the world, ironically meant the end of any hope for civilization to recover just before the Sage gives chakra to the world. The emergence of the so-called Hidden Villages [Naruto] from the so-called “neo-ninjas”, mercenaries with the ability to use chakra posing as the legendary shinobi of Japan’s feudal and early Meiji era, [the rise of the “neo-ninjas”] also further ruins things as the Hidden Villages monopolize technology and [the Hidden Villages] keep the Tailed Beasts [Naruto] between themselves [the Hidden Villages] in an arms race surprisingly similar to that between the USSR and the USA during the Cold War","output":"**UNSC (United Nuclear Security Coalition) Data Log Entry 037-02: Recovered Transmission** **Subject:** Historical Archive - Summary on the Origins and Development of Chakra Wielding Civilizations Post-Cataclysm **Recovered By:** The Remnants of Technology Archival Division (RTAD) **Date of Recovery:** [DATA EXPUNGED] **Entry Begins Below:** In the wake of the immense nuclear cataclysm triggered by the misinterpretation of NATO\'s Able Archer exercise by the Soviet Union, the global landscape faced an unparalleled transformation. The fallout obliterated the existing industrial and emergent digital civilizations, casting mankind into an age where myth became intertwined with reality. The Third World as was previously known succumbed to the radioactive remnants of war, its annihilation completed by the unintended release of biological contaminants. As humanity struggled to rekindle the embers of its former glory amidst the ruins, Europe and East Asia reverted to feudal structures amid their slow re-emergence. It was amidst this rebirth that an extraordinary phenomenon manifested – the appearance of beings classified as \\"monster girls,\\" alongside the resurgence of mysticism and the deities of antiquity. The lore of monster girls is corroborated by ancient manuscripts and encrypted data fragments, relating tales of the Kingdom of Lescatie – a once-mighty theocratic monarchy firmly opposed to the existence of these entities. The fall of Lescatie coincided with the early days of the restoration, crushing the last vestige of hope for a return to societal advancement as it once was known. Enter the enigmatic figure known as the Sage of Six Paths. Historical records pieced together from numerous lost civilizations suggest the Sage\'s intention to unify humanity through the dispersal of an energy source that could bridge understanding – chakra. However, this act, rather than saving the world, is speculated to have locked it into an eternal cycle of feudal struggle and mystic obsessions. The feudalistic nature of this post-apocalyptic landscape found its epitome in the emergence of \\"neo-ninjas\\" – mercenaries trained in the mystical arts of chakra, emulating the legendary shinobi of Japan\'s bygone eras. These neo-ninjas established formidable enclaves: The Hidden Villages. The Hidden Villages, driven by their leaders and the monopolization of advanced remnants of technology, became akin to the principal rivals of the ancient Cold War, engrossed in a fierce competition not unlike the nuclear arms race. This rivalry centered upon potent chakra entities known as Tailed Beasts, which they utilized as strategic deterrents and instruments of power. Further compounding the disintegration of a unified effort towards technological renaissance, RTAD has observed an operational pattern suggesting that the Hidden Villages are actively suppressing knowledge dissemination to maintain their hegemony over the new world order. This has forced our organization and other similar factions to pursue underground operations to evade the pervasive influence of these Villages. **Conclusion:** The evolution of this apocalyptic world into one governed by feudalistic Hidden Villages and the dominance of chakra and monster girls marks a monumental shift in human history. The Sage of Six Paths, rather than heralding an age of understanding, may have inadvertently condemned humanity to a perpetual state of mythic feudalism. RTAD continues its mission to recover and safeguard the remnants of lost knowledge, in the hope that one day, humanity may reclaim its legacy of progress and unity. **End of Entry.** **Warning:** Access to this terminal and any subsequent data retrieval is monitored.

Tensions mounted during what was documented as the \'Able Archer\' NATO exercises, misconstrued by Soviet leadership as a genuine first-strike scenario. **Event:** The catastrophic nuclear exchange, initiated by the Soviet Union under false threat perception, resulted in devastating outcomes. Much of the industrialized and developing world crumbled, while vast regions, particularly within Africa and other third-world territories, were devastated by both nuclear fallout and unleashed bioweapons—entities of experimental and malevolent origin. In the aftermath, the globe witnessed not only the paroxysm of environmental disasters but also the radical alteration of humanity\'s evolutionary trajectory. Magic, long dismissed as myth within the desecrated academia, returned with vigor, reinvigorating the ancient pantheons and mythical creatures previously relegated to folklore. **Monster Girls Phenomenon:** It is hypothesized, factoring in varying reports from the period of reconstruction and archeological findings, that the apocalyptic energies released worked as a catalyst for the emergence of so-called \\"monster girls.\\" This coincided with the resurgence of mystical forces, essentially rewriting the fabric of reality. **Lescatie and the Inversion of Progress:** As per recorded histories collated from disparate sources, the Kingdom of Lescatie stood as the last bastion of human civilization striving to return to a pre-apocalyptic state of technological sophistication. Lescatie\'s defiance against the monster-girl contingent was significant—it represented a final, futile stand of humanistic values and rationalism against the capricious whims and magical dominion enforced by the monster girls. The fall of Lescatie, occurring antecedent to the birth of [Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki], the one known to scholars as the Sage of Six Paths, marked the erosion of any lingering prospect for pre-catastrophe societal structure restoration. The Sage\'s subsequent dissemination of chakra, initially intended for fostering understanding and unity, instead further fragmented the world, entrapping it perpetually in feudalism and mysticism. **The Emergence of Hidden Villages and Neo-Ninjas:** In the vacuum of world order, individuals with affinities for chakra manipulation styled themselves as \\"neo-ninjas,\\" redefining the term and concept of the shinobi, significantly departing from the historical connotations bound to feudal Japan. With time, these neo-ninjas coalesced into entities now known as Hidden Villages, effectively militarizing chakra and engaging in subversive monopolization of technology. The newfound societal power wielded by Hidden Villages mirrored the division of the otherworldly entities known as Tailed Beasts, reminiscent of the arms race typified in the deceased age by the Cold War\'s nuclear stockpiling. The legacy of reciprocal distrust and armament perpetuation appears to have been subliminally inherited and manifested anew. **Conclusion:** This data log, thus, serves as both an exposition and a grim testament to the learned follies of a bygone era. The world today, riddled with echoes of ancient myths and contemporary martial stratagems, stands as a living reminder of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki\'s—[The Sage of Six Paths\']—unintended legacy. The semblance of technological enlightenment remains shrouded, much like the STR; nevertheless, it perpetuates the flame of understanding, with hopes that history shall not be lost to chakra\'s dazzling veil. **End of Data Log #001**"},{"instruction":"hola","output":"¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"ayudame con el curso Desarrollo de Servicios Web 1. te estare enviando codigo","output":"¡Claro!

This coincides with the inexplicable genesis of hybridized entities—documented colloquially as \\"monster girls\\"—which correlate to humanoid creatures possessing animalistic and mythical features with enhanced physical or magical abilities, often elaborated in both the \\"Monster Girl Quest\\" and the \\"Monster Girl Encyclopedia.\\" In the aftermath of the obliteration of contemporary infrastructure and the subsequent dissolution of nation-states, two disparate historical points appear to converge: the fall of the Kingdom of Lescatie and the advent of a figure known as the \\"Sage of the Six Paths.\\" **Addendum 1 [TCRS]:** The TCRS hypothesizes that the emergence of the so-called \\"monster girls\\" post-apocalypse, alongside the reawakening of arcane forces, expedited the permanent encasement of Earth\'s civilizations within a feudal paradigm. It was during this tumultuous period that the event known as the \\"Fall of Lescatie\\" occurred—a pivotal point marking the end of the last great bastion against the new, mystical status quo. **Addendum 2 [TCRS]:** Contrary to propagated legends, it seems the Sage of the Six Paths did not aim to foster peace by disseminating the power known as chakra. Archival fragments suggest chakra was introduced to the populace in an environment already poisoned by chaos and mysticism. The Sage\'s actions rendered irreversible the commitment to feudalism, as chakra would become another tool to consolidate power rather than unify humanity. **Addendum 3 [TCRS]:** Underground reports indicate that such consolidation of power manifested in the formation of Hidden Villages, purportedly arising from self-styled \\"neo-ninjas.\\" These quasi-official orders monopolize remnants of technology while commandeering esoteric forces—specifically, entities designated as \\"Tailed Beasts.\\" Observational parallels are drawn to the Cold War-era arms race between extinct superpowers. **Addendum 4 [TCRS]:** Akasuki, now recognized as a militarized faction operating from the vicinity of a geographically reconstituted Hidden Rain Village, the alleged former New York, further destabilizes any potential recovery by engaging in subversive power accumulation. Their machinations appear to mimic revolutionary factions of the bygone world, operating under a guise of ideological purity but possessing motivations as vague as they are insidious. **Latest Field Notes [TCRS]:** Unverified whispers circulate amongst the populace, telling of far-eastern enclaves where an unprecedented symbiosis exists between humans, \\"monster girls,\\" and chakra wielders. These utopic settlements are said to experiment with melding lost technology and mystical arts, challenging the overarching paradigm of eternal feudalism. The TCRS, before transitioning to clandestine operations to avoid persecution by the entrenched feudal hierarchies and emergent Hidden Villages, recommends the preservation of this terminal as a beacon of the old world\'s lost potential. Additional reconnaissance and interaction with said enclaves—if they indeed exist—may prove paramount to rediscovering a path toward civilization\'s resurrection or an understanding of humanity\'s new place in this re-enchanted world. **Conclusion [UN Forces]:** The composite of these accounts, spanning eras of darkness and disparate chronicles of strife, paints a kaleidoscope of human resilience amidst a reversion to bygone mythologies. Despite the fragmented nature of our understanding, it remains clear that the past, in all its forms, grips tight upon the throat of the present, dictating the cadence of humanity\'s shared future. **DATA ENTRY TERMINATED** **[ACCESS RECORD: LAST ENTRY LOGGED BY ID UNKNOWN—STATUS OF TCRS REMAINS UNCONFIRMED]**"},{"instruction":"choose a random popular marvel hero, one word only","output":"Spider-Man"},{"instruction":"Dimmi cosa è il CuCN","output":"Il CuCN sta per cianuro di rame(I), una sostanza chimica inorganica composta da rame in stato di ossidazione +1 e ione cianuro (CN^-).

Compounded by the nuclear holocaust initiated by the now-defunct Soviet Union under Operation **Able Archer**, close misinterpretations of military exercises led to worldwide devastation, irreversibly transforming the geopolitical and natural landscape. Post-event analysis revealed Africa and much of the \\"Third World\\" (a term from an archaic geopolitical lexicon) annihilated by both nuclear fallout and the uncontrolled release of experimental bioweapons. This apocalyptic calamity underscored the collapse of industrial society, swiftly followed by the resurgence of feudal systems, particularly in the remnants of Europe and East Asia. Within this restructured world order, an enigmatic emergence of entities henceforth referred to as \\"monster girls\\" or \\"Liminal Entities\\" (LE) was documented. Their origin, initially shrouded in mystery, is posited to relate to reintroduced arcane energies following the nuclear desolation. Simultaneously, mythological deities and forgotten magic resurged, eroding the foundations of established scientific understanding. The fall of the last bastion against these phenomena, the Kingdom of Lescatie, marked a definitive turning point, indicating the obsolescence of industrial-era civilization. During this tumultuous era, legendary figures rose, none more significant than the one referred to as the \\"Sage of Six Paths\\" (SoSP). Misinterpreted as a savior, SoSP introduced a newly discovered power—chakra—to the remnant populations. Unfortunately, the naive aspiration that such power would be utilized for enlightenment and unification of humankind proved ill-founded. Instead, chakra solidified the globe\'s descent into a neofeudal tapestry, with warfare and power stratification proliferating more complexly than ever. Thus emerged the \\"neo-ninjas,\\" a cadre of mercenaries with chakra manipulation abilities masquerading as the mythic shinobi of ancient Japan. Their influence spawned the creation of Hidden Villages, which became power centers monopolizing remaining advanced technology and forming strategic caches of chakra-laden beasts—akin to the nuclear deterrents of the bygone era. Notable among these villages is the one known as \\"Hidden Rain,\\" situated among the ruins of the Old World\'s \\"New York\\". This locale eventually nurtured the burgeoning faction **Akatsuki**, demonstrating both resilience and opportunism in facing existential threats. Unconfirmed reports propose a distant civilization, rumored to be the amalgamation of chakra wielders, LEs, and remaining unaltered humans, potentially also integrating other anomalous beings presenting \\"Quirks.\\" These whispers lend credence to the myth of a land where coexistence prevails—a new society thriving beyond the chakra-fueled wars and petty squabbles of our tattered world order.

The positive and negative directions for the X and Y-axes on a milling machine are determined by the coordinate system being used, typically following the right-hand rule. It is not based on the workpiece\'s movement relative to the spindle but rather on the predefined orientation of the machine\'s axes. In the right-hand rule, if you point the thumb of your right hand in the positive direction of the Z-axis, your index finger will point in the positive direction of the X-axis, and your middle finger will point in the positive direction of the Y-axis. This rule is a convention for determining direction in a Cartesian coordinate system commonly used in machining and engineering. For most vertical milling machines: - The X-axis typically moves left to right, with right being positive. - The Y-axis generally moves forward and away from the operator, with away being the positive direction. - The Z-axis moves up and down, with up being positive.

The once-thriving Second and Third Worlds are no more, befallen by atomic fire and uncontrolled biological horrors. Fallout decimated Africa and rendered it uninhabitable. Simultaneously, the societal collapse and the reversion towards feudal systems have carved up the remnants of Europe and East Asia into isolated fiefdoms and realms, where advancement is a myth, and survival is the only goal. It was from these ashes, amidst the dust of a forgotten technological era and scorned gods’ whispers, that \\"monster girls\\" emerged. This phenomenon, initially perceived as a myth, has become a nightmarish reality, redefining the very fabric of known life and magic post-apocalypse. *Origins of Monster Girls: Corresponding with the Monster Girl Quest and Encyclopedia accounts, their birth is a direct consequence of nuclear-induced mutation and arcane reawakening.* The Kingdom of Lescatie, a bastion of human purity and resolve against the twilight surge of monster girls, fell just prior to an unforeseen pivot in human history. This downfall marked the end of our race\'s struggle to claw back our lost future. It ushered in an unparalleled era that blended arcane magic with the resurgence of ancient deities who lay dormant beneath the Earth\'s radiated crust. Enter the being who would later be known as the Sage of Six Paths. In his quest to unify humanity, he disseminated chakra – an energy once thought esoteric, now horrifically commonplace. Instead of binding people through understanding, he laid the foundation for perpetual conflict, the dominion of the Hidden Villages, and the commodification of knowledge and power. *The Sage\'s Legacy: While intended as a gift, chakra became a tool of oppression. The Hidden Villages, likened to the historically known shinobi\'s haunts, grew into formidable state-like entities, hoarding technological marvels and controlling the masses with militaristic prowess.* As these villages entrenched their status, Akatsuki emerged from the shadows of the Hidden Rain Village, once called New York. This organization would grow to rival even the most potent shinobi collectives, contesting the geopolitical theatrics akin to the Cold War standoffs of old. Whispered amidst the chaos, tales of advanced civilizations beyond the Warring States whisper hope. Such utopian dreams speak of a land where humans, chakra-users, and monster girls coexist—a supposed sanctuary from the dogmatic rule that stifles diversity and progress. *Eastern Phenomenon: Rumors of progressive civilizations have come to light. Accounts point towards a crossover of untouched legacies from distinct worlds – specifically, My Hero Academia\'s \\"Quirks,\\" Date a Live\'s multi-dimensional beings, and Fire Force\'s flame-manipulating pyrokinetics.* The formidable Great Tokyo Empire appears to have arisen, unchecked by the nuclear devastation that befell the rest of the world. Here, technology thrives, and ancient lineages oversee an empire that stretches beyond the island nation, echoing the ambition of pre-apocalyptic Japan. While the concept of Quirks, as feared and revered in My Hero Academia, never saw the rise of \'Quirk Supremacy,\' the absence of a Meta Liberation Army has allowed the Great Tokyo Empire to flourish. Untethered from the constraints of such ideologies, they\'ve succeeded in consolidating power over their former territories and exercising influence over neighboring regions. Conclusively, if the empire\'s expansion continues, the tumultuous landscape that is our world might see a shift toward a balance unknown since the days before the nuclear winter.

The legendary Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] did not save the world by introducing chakra [Naruto] to the world in the hopes of people getting to know each other, but [the sage] instead doomed it to be forever trapped in feudalism and mysticism due to his [the Sage’s] childish, delusional, overly optimistic and the Sage’s [Naruto’s] flawed understanding of humanity, as the fall of the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal monarchial crusader state Kingdom of Lescatie [Monster Girl Encyclopedia] to the monster girls just before the Sage [Naruto] gave chakra [Naruto] to the world, [Lescatie’s fall to the monster girls just before the Sage giving chakra to the world] ironically meant the end of any hope for civilization to recover just before the Sage gives chakra to the world.

The records show that the threshold of our demise was precipitated not by malice but by a tragic misreading of intentions. It was the year of 1983 when the Soviet Union misconstrued NATO\'s Able Archer exercise as an act of aggression, triggering their doomsday protocol. The ensuing nuclear holocaust eradicated the post-WW2 global order, obliterating the digital age that stood on the horizon. The fallout was swift and merciless; Africa and what was once termed the Third World vanished beneath nuclear fire and rampant bioweapons unleashed in the chaos of the apocalypse. Europe and East Asia descended into darkness, with the fragile flames of civilization flickering out one by one. In the grim aftermath, a new feudal era dawned, where lords and fiefs carved out domains from the ashes of the old world. Amid this regressive slide into the past, a curious phenomenon emerged. The veil between myth and reality thinned, and beings long thought to be mere legend began to take shape. The \\"monster girls,\\" as they were called, manifested alongside a resurgence of magic and the pantheon of the ancients. It was as if humanity\'s devastating folly had rent the fabric of existence, allowing the fantastical to bleed through the tears. Prior to the fall, there was one last bastion that stood against the encroaching tide of the otherworldly—the Kingdom of Lescatie. A staunchly theocratic and royalist state, it waged fervent crusades against the beings it deemed abominations. Nevertheless, Lescatie\'s collapse, mere moments before the pivotal awakening of the Sage of Six Paths, signaled the end of any chance for civilization to recover its lost technological prowess. The Sage, revered in what was left of historical texts, was not humanity\'s savior as once thought. It was his introduction of chakra that doomed the species to eternal darkness, bound by mysticism and feudal strife. In his misguided, youthful idealism, the Sage believed chakra would unite mankind. Instead, it reinforced divisions, enabling the rise of \\"neo-ninjas,\\" individuals capable of harnessing these newfound energies, masquerading as the historic shinobi of a bygone age. These neo-ninjas formed Hidden Villages, which hoarded technological secrets and engaged in a covert arms race, maintaining a precarious balance with the imprisoned Tailed Beasts at the center of their power plays. Analogous to the Cold War\'s nuclear standoff, this tension created a world of espionage, subterfuge, and shadow wars. Among these Hidden Villages, the remnants of New York, now known as the Hidden Rain Village, subsisted in the post-apocalyptic world. There, whispers of a mysterious organization named Akatsuki surfaced, boding ill for the fragile order of the shinobi-dominated lands. Elsewhere, rumors persisted of utopian enclaves where humanity, monster girls, and chakra wielders coexisted in technological harmony. These tales spoke of the Far East\'s resurgence, where the devastation of nuclear fire had not quenched the spirit of progress. Here, the Great Tokyo Empire expanded the bounds of what was once Japan, reclaiming territories lost to history and forging alliances with once sovereign nations. In a world devoid of Quirks, Heroes, and the Meta Liberation Army, this burgeoning power became a sanctuary of advancement in a darkened age. The archive ends with a poignant note: a longing for what might have been—a civilization that looked beyond feudal chains and the lure of ancient mysticism. Whether the tale of this unique confluence in history is a beacon of hope or a dirge for lost potential remains for posterity to interpret. **[The remainder of this document has been corrupted or otherwise rendered unreadable...]** **End of Archive** --- (As per the guidelines of the request, this data log exists within the context of the fictional world and intentionally does not reference the real world, fan fiction, or alternate historical scenarios.

The resulting cataclysm obliterated the geopolitical landscape of the late 20th century, leading to the decimation of the Third World, the collapse of modern civilization, and the vast regression of technological capabilities. The subsequent introduction of a nuclear winter, coupled with unleashed bioweaponry, ravaged the remaining pockets of life. As civilization began to regain a semblance of order amidst the desolation, Europe and East Asia reverted to a system reminiscent of feudalism. It was within this crucible that anomalies first emerged. **Monster Girl Emergence and Mythological Resurgence** Records indicate the first appearance of \\"monster girls,\\" creatures amalgamating human and mythical beast features, coincided with the re-emergence of magical energies and a return of ancient gods. It is hypothesized that the nuclear conflagration and subsequent environmental changes may have catalyzed this rebirth of fantastical elements. Theorists attribute this to a reawakening of latent genetic memories or exposure to unknown energies released during the Great Cataclysm. The once-holy Kingdom of Lescatie became a focal point within the global reconfiguration. Guided by an absolute monarchial regime and a strong theocratic system, Lescatie vehemently opposed the existence of monster girls. However, records detail an ironic twist of fate: the fall Lescatie—synonymous with the last bastion of pre-catastrophic moral order—transpired just before the Sage of Six Paths began propagating the use of chakra. Its collapse marked the conclusive failure of regaining a pre-catastrophe civilization. **The Sage of Six Paths and the Misguided Dawn of Chakra** As chronicled by AC historians, the Sage of Six Paths, lauded in future eras for his intent to unify humanity, may have inadvertently entrenched the world in an obscurantism from which it could never escape. Idealistic visions of empathy and understanding fostered through the shared language of chakra instead birthed a stratified social order, power wars, and the perpetual incarceration of the Tailed Beasts – eerily mirroring the nuclear arms race of the bygone era. Claims have arisen that the Sage sought not only to bestow chakra upon the world but also to serve as a check against the growing influence of monster girls by providing humanity with a means to defend themselves – a conjecture hotly debated within AC circles. **Neo-Ninjas, Hidden Villages, and Post-Catastrophe Geopolitics** The rise of the Hidden Villages stemmed from groups of \\"neo-ninjas,\\" mercenaries skilled in the arts of chakra. These individuals drew inspiration from the legendary shinobi of Japan\'s feudal and post-feudal eras. These villages, effectively states-within-a-state, emerged as central powers, dominating the surviving technological reserves and managing the delicate balance of power by hoarding the Tailed Beasts. As the Akatsuki organization developed amidst the shadows of the Hidden Rain Village (formerly New York), whispers of far-off lands began to circulate – tales of integrated societies where humans, monster girls, and chakra users coexisted. **Confluence of Nations in the Far East** Recent expeditions suggest that the Great Tokyo Empire has succeeded in unifying formerly Japanese territories alongside remnants of other Asian sovereignties under a single banner. Reviving historical entities such as Manchukuo, the Mongolian United Autonomous Government, and the Beiyang Government showcases the conflagration of tradition and innovation. Though little is known of their true capabilities and societal structure, this empire purportedly stands as a beacon of integration where monster girls, humans, and chakra wielders contribute equally to society. This document is to be considered a living archive, undergoing continuous updates from verified field operatives across various regions. End Log: **Archivist Coalition Note** Knowledge of these events remains concealed from public knowledge by Hidden Village decrees and the impending threat from the Akatsuki. Our organization, now disbanded and forced into secrecy, continues to strive for the preservation and revival of forgotten lore. Should this terminal be uncovered, let it serve as evidence of history\'s cyclical tragedy and lost potential.

Finally, we’ll have some high-end shopping right on our doorstep. Just had to share the excitement!!! BargainHunter99: Yeah, the Tesco is nice and all, but have you heard the gossip about Farmfoods, Gala Bingo, and Greggs? Word is they’re resisting moving out of the old Pollok Centre. They say they’re ‘too low class’ for the shiny new Silverburn. Honestly, can you believe that? 😒 LocalGreggsFan: Gala Bingo and Farmfoods, I get, but Greggs? C’mon, it’s a staple! There’s nothing ‘low class’ about a delicious sausage roll. Plus, they seem to be working out a deal to fit into the new aesthetic so fingers crossed 🤞🥖 TrendyTracy: This is the kind of snobbery that splits communities IMO. Remember when we had all those independent shops before the big chains swooped in? Silverburn should reflect ALL of us, not just those who want to flash their cash. 🙄 #DiversityInRetail ShopaholicSuzie: @TrendyTracy, I totally get where you’re coming from, but think of the job opportunities! Plus, we deserve a bit of glamour too, don’t you think? Why should we always have to travel into the city for the fancy stores? 💅🏻✨ PollokPurist: I’m not thrilled about this. Tesco is just the beginning. What’s next, designer boutiques where the community centre used to be? Don’t get me wrong, I like progress, but not at the cost of our identity. #KeepPollokAuthentic SilverburnInsider: Insider scoop here – the management is working hard to make sure the centre has a mix of shops. The idea is to cater to everyone. Greggs has a strong presence in the community, so I wouldn’t count them out just yet! DealDiva: Speaking of Tesco, anyone knows if they’re doing any opening specials? Maybe even a BOGO deal on pizza or something? I could do with saving a few quid this week 😅🍕 ModeratorNotice: Let’s keep the conversation respectful, folks! Remember, change can be daunting, but it can also bring new opportunities. Let’s wait and see what the full plans for Silverburn entail before jumping to conclusions. Keep sharing your thoughts and insights! VoteForYourShops: Hey everyone, there’s talk about a survey being circulated by the developers. If you want a say in which shops make it into the final lineup, now’s the time to speak up! 📝🏬 TheSilverburnAU thread would continue to accumulate responses, reflecting the diverse opinions and speculations of the Pollok community. Some users would remain skeptical, others optimistic, and all would be keeping a close eye on the evolution of their local shopping landscape. Title: Silverburn AU: New Beginnings & Lingering Echoes of the Old Pollok Centre Thread Started by ShopaholicSuzie on October 12, 2003 ShopaholicSuzie: Hello PollokShoppers! 🎉 The moment so many of us have been waiting for has finally arrived - Silverburn is officially open! It’s got everything - fashion outlets, eateries, a cinema. It’s a dream come true! 🛍️🎬 But have you seen the old Pollok Centre? It’s a bit of a sight with some spots wrapped in wallpaper with artsy frames, a painted sky, and the flashy Silverburn logo. Halfway transformation, I guess? What are your thoughts? BargainHunter99: Drove past the old centre today, and it’s surreal. The wallpaper thing is odd. Feels like they’re stuck between wanting to preserve the past and pushing forward. Not sure how I feel about it… 😕 LocalGreggsFan: Glad to report that Greggs is thriving in Silverburn! 😁 But you should see the wallpaper over at the old Pollok Centre; it’s like a giant art project. Weird to see the place dressed up as something it’s not. Anyone else feeling a little nostalgic? TrendyTracy: The old centre with the wallpaper looks like a plaster over a wound. It’s artsy, sure, but also a bit sad. Feels like a token gesture to ‘beautify’ what they haven’t torn down yet… 🎨🤔 #MixedFeelings PollokPurist: Saw the new Silverburn and wow – it’s impressive, can’t deny it. But that wallpaper on the old centre - it’s like they’re trying to hide our history. I mean, come on, a painted sky? We know it’s not the limit, so let’s not pretend it is. 🌌 #PreserveOurPast SilverburnInsider: The wallpaper covering is a temporary measure, folks. It’s meant to soften the transition and bring an element of Silverburn’s look to the old site while future plans are being finalized. There’s a bit of a symbolic merging happening so bear with us! DealDiva: Anyone else more interested in the Silverburn sales than the wallpaper drama? Let’s focus on the positive, like discounts!

They’ve got this quirky setup with TVs making a Christmas tree shape—pretty creative! There’s, like, three different versions. During the day, the screens have got festive decorations showing on them. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I caught a glimpse of it just this evening! They switch to static in the night version—it’s kinda eerie but cool. It really caught my eye while I was doing some late-night shopping. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Oh, you guys are talking about the Silverburn ad? I especially loved the third variation. There’s something magical about the screens being off at night and then suddenly they flash on to reveal those beautiful decorations before going dark again. It’s like they’re coming alive! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Yes! Those ads with the LED snowflake and Santa at the back though—they kind of bring it all together with that ambient glow and subtle shadows. Noticed them when I was there with the kids last weekend. They were pretty intrigued by it. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): I’m loving their slogan: “Switch on Christmas at Silverburn.” It’s catchy, it fits perfectly with the theme they’ve got going on. Really makes you feel like the holidays are here. — User5 (CarolSinger): Who’s in charge of the campaign, do y’all know? It’s nice to see them putting so much effort into the holiday vibes. Also, glad they’re going for something a bit different than the usual big red bows and glitter. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Not sure who’s behind it, but I read somewhere that they’re aiming for a “techy Christmas” vibe. Modern, fresh but still festive. My guess is they want to appeal to a younger crowd as well as families. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Techy Christmas indeed. It’s impressive how much work must’ve gone into setting those screens up safely. And I’ve got to say—I’m kinda curious about the tech specs on those TVs. Do we know what kind they’re using? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): If any of you are thinking of heading down to Silverburn, bring a camera. Those TV Christmas trees are super Insta-worthy. And props to Silverburn for starting the festive buzz in such a unique way! — User7 (NoelTechie): Heard that these ads are a part of a larger holiday campaign with some interactive installations planned inside the shopping centre. Can’t wait to see what else they have in store! Silverburn is seriously upping the Christmas game this year. — User8 (MerryDancer): With everything so digital this year, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a shopping centre embrace the theme but with a cosy holiday twist. Props to Silverburn, let’s hope this attracts more folks and gets the economy buzzing. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Couldn’t agree more! And speaking of shopping, I might have a wander over there this weekend. If those Christmas TV trees are a sign, we’re all in for some serious festive treats at Silverburn! 🎄✨ — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Just a friendly reminder to keep the discussion friendly and respectful. Also, remember to share your own experiences and pictures if you visit the campaign installations. Great to see everyone getting in the spirit of the holidays! Keep the conversation glowing like those LED snowflakes. 🎅👋 — Write a follow up where the ads show on STV once per break, they are also being shown on the advertising screens in centre, but without the slogan or Silverburn logo, website and directions in the corner of the screen at the end Thread Title: Silverburn’s Christmas Ads Now on STV and In-Centre Screens! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Hey everyone! Have you seen that the Silverburn Christmas ads have landed on STV? They’re showing up once every ad break. The tree made of TVs is legit becoming iconic now. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Caught one during ‘Corrie’ last night, they’re really spreading the holiday cheer. Also noticed them on the advertising screens all over the centre. Although, they’ve left off the slogan and logo? 🤔 Just the website and directions sitting discreetly in the corner. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yes, @YuleTideYoda, I found that a bit odd too. It’s all minimalist on the screens within the centre. Maybe they think the TV tree is recognisable enough on its own now? At least the website’s there, or we’d all be wondering where this magical place is! — User5 (CarolSinger): Smart move putting them up on STV, everyone’s going to see those ads. My Gran even mentioned the “telly-tree” to me this morning. Silverburn’s marketing folks know what they’re doing! — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a neat strategy to keep the ads uncluttered in the centre. Keeps the focus on the installation. On STV, the full details pop up right at the end. Less is more, sometimes! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Those ads are making waves. My kids go quiet every time one comes on TV. Eyes glued to the screen! But yeah, noticed the minimal approach on the in-centre ad screens, too. Makes it kinda like a tease, which probably piques people’s curiosity. — User7 (NoelTechie): Hah, they’ve got us all talking about it, so it’s working! I personally like the clean look on the centre screens. The holiday aesthetics don’t always need the hard sell. It’s like the TVs whisper: “There’s more if you just follow the magic to Silverburn.” — User9 (StarlightShopper): Just spotted the ads at the centre today! The LED snowflake behind me literally made me feel like I was in a winter wonderland. No logo needed, the vibe says it all. Now if only they had seasonal lattes right next to them… — User8 (MerryDancer): This low-key approach in the centre is kind of refreshing. You get the info if you want it, but otherwise, you’re just immersed in the festive atmosphere. And it’s everywhere, can’t escape the Christmas spirit if you tried! — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Am I the only one who’s going to Silverburn just to see the telly-tree now? 😂 These ads have done their job on me. Also need to check if the Santa LED makes an appearance on the STV ads, it’s my favourite part! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn is the talk of the town with their Christmas campaign! Remember to share your ad sightings and any festive moments you capture while visiting. Let’s keep the conversations merry and bright! And who knows, maybe next time we’ll have the scent of lattes accompanying those LEDs, @StarlightShopper! ☕ 🎄 — Write a follow up the next year where 2008’s ads feature the love story of 2 gooey alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter, The slogan is “Spend Christmas together”, The ads are showing on STV, but for some reason it debuted during Toonattik instead of during the evening, A nostalgic surprise is still in-centre via the advert screens however Thread Title: Silverburn 2008 Christmas Campaign - A Love Story of Two Aliens?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Can’t believe what I just saw on TV this morning! Silverburn’s got this year’s Christmas campaign featuring two alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter! 😍 It’s all about spending Christmas together. What a twist from last year’s tech theme! — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I was up early with my niece watching Toonattik and bam, there’s the ad. A bit unexpected for a kids’ morning slot, don’t you think? But the love story between Gloopy and Glitter is pretty adorable. I guess love transcends galaxies! — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Just saw it! Their slogan “Spend Christmas Together” hits right in the feels. And Gloopy and Glitter are too cute! It’s a big shift from the techy trees. Aliens are not what you’d normally think of for Christmas, but hey, it works! — User5 (CarolSinger): Anyone know why it debuted on Toonattik instead of prime time? Seems like they’re targeting families and children this year. My little ones can’t stop talking about Gloopy and Glitter, so I guess it’s effective! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The ad is a creative approach, but airing it during Toonattik threw me off. Guess their marketing strategy is to appeal to the younger crowd and, of course, their present-buying parents. — User7 (NoelTechie): So, about the in-centre nostalgia surprise… anyone saw it yet? Heard from a mate that they’ve incorporated some classic holiday elements on the advert screens. It’s a cool juxtaposition with the modern alien love story. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Just stopping by to add that I went to Silverburn and can confirm they have some really nostalgic Christmas ads playing on the screens amidst the Gloopy and Glitter stuff - think sugary, heartwarming, old-school vibes. Really adds to the warm and fuzzy feelings while shopping! — User8 (MerryDancer): Absolutely loving this year’s theme switch-up. I didn’t expect to get emotional over two gooey alien blobs, but here I am. And the sprinkle of nostalgia in the centre? Chef’s kiss! 😘 — User9 (StarlightShopper): I have to admit, Gloopy and Glitter kinda grew on me. Initially, it felt a bit out there, but the message is universal. And those nostalgic in-centre ads? They definitely balance the new with a dose of classic Christmas warmth. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I thought nothing would top last year’s campaign, but Gloopy and Glitter are stealing my heart. Also, saw those classic Christmas ads at the centre… it’s like they brought a bit of our childhoods back to life amidst the shopping spree. — User11 (LostInFrost): Does anyone know if they’re planning to bring Gloopy and Glitter in for a meet-and-greet? My kids would lose it! Cute campaign, Silverburn. You’ve done it again. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn has once again captured our attention with their creative Christmas storytelling! Remember, keep sharing your thoughts, feelings, and any cosmic encounters with Gloopy and Glitter. Let’s keep the holiday cheer inclusive, even if it’s from another planet! 👽🎄 Blog Title: Christmas 2008 Brings Gooey Goodbye to Silver and a Morning Surprise! Date: December 3, 2008 Ho, ho, ho, Silverburn shoppers and early birds alike! Christmas came early this year with a morning mishap that had us chuckling over our cornflakes. It’s time to talk about Silverburn’s latest ad campaign, the new mascots on the block, and a fond farewell to a shiny friend. Gloopy & Glitter Steal the Morning Show Let me set the scene: It’s a brisk December morning, the kind where you’re snuggled in your PJs, a cup of hot cocoa in hand, and your favourite morning show playing on the telly. Then, just as the show reaches its climax—BAM!—the screen cuts to Gloopy and Glitter’s gooey grand entrance. If you’re one to indulge in a spot of Toonattik with your tots or alone (no judgement here!), you’ll have witnessed this firsthand. Whoops? More like, Wow! Not an ideal debut time, you say? We agree, but this extraterrestrial escapade into the wee hours of children’s programming was more than just a faux pas—it was a brilliant strategy. The kids are hooked, parents are bemused, and we’re all suddenly invested in the love life of two amorphous blobs. Talk about effective advertising! Silver’s Shiny Send-Off Now, it wasn’t just Gloopy and Glitter’s surprise premiere that had the rumour mill spinning. It’s the bittersweet news that Silverburn’s long-standing mascot, Silver, is set to retire by the year’s end. Yes, the gleaming guardian of the galaxy of shops we’ve grown to love is taking a final bow, making room for our new gelatinous duo to spread their glittery charm. Let’s raise a glass to Silver, the metallic mate who’s seen us through many a shopping spree. Though we’re sad to see him go, it’s heartening to know he’s leaving us in the capable… blobs?.. of Gloopy and Glitter. A Laugh at the Launch Timing Back to the premiere that sparked the buzz—turns out, someone at the ad agency must have decided that all the evening slots were too mainstream. “Let’s show the world our boldness,” they declared, “let’s air it when they least expect it!” And thus, a looming figure in the ad world is now affectionately dubbed ‘the morning maverick’. Wearing this title with unintended pride, they gave us a launch to remember and a story for years to come. Embracing Our Gooey Future As we chuckle at the enthusiastic aliens taking over our breakfast TV slots, let’s also embrace this change with open arms (and maybe a bit of hand sanitizer—for the goo). Silverburn Shopping Centre is setting the stage for a new era: one that promises to be filled with humour, unexpected joys, and shopping experiences that are out of this world. So, here’s to a Christmas season with a twist! Expect the unexpected, find humour in the little things, and may the gooey goodness of Gloopy and Glitter warm your hearts. Silver might be stepping out of the spotlight, but the future of Silverburn shines bright…or shall we say, sparkles? Merry Christmas, shoppers! 🎄✨ With a twinkle in my eye, [Your Name] Silverburn’s Enthusiastic Shopper and Morning Show Commentator — Thread Title: Silverburn’s Last Year’s Ads Still Playing & Potential Kid’s Club Mascots?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Went to Silverburn yesterday and was super surprised to see last year’s Christmas ads still playing on the screens around the centre. No new ads for TV this year, but the Gloopy and Glitter saga continues in-centre. Anyone else seen this? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Yeah, noticed that too, @GlasgowGlitter! And have y’all heard the rumors about Gloopy and Glitter becoming the face of Silverburn’s upcoming kids club? Braehead’s already ahead with their “Brae-liens Kids Club”. Alien fever’s catching on, eh? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Gloopy and Glitter as kid’s club mascots would be ace! My kiddos are fond of those blobs. But interesting to think Silverburn is following Braehead’s launch. Wasn’t expecting the alien theme to become a trend! — User7 (NoelTechie): Braehead’s “Brae-liens” are fun and all with their defined shapes, but I’m curious to see how Silverburn’s amorphous Gloopy and Glitter will translate into a kids’ club format. Will lend a different vibe, which might be cool! — User5 (CarolSinger): It feels like the aliens are officially invading Glasgow, lol. First Braehead’s structured and playful Brae-liens, now Silverburn’s squishy mascots. The kids are gonna have a blast with this. Should be fun comparing the two! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Anyone else think they’re keeping last year’s ads to maintain Gloopy and Glitter’s presence till the club launches? It’s smart, though. Keep the characters familiar to the kiddos. High hopes for this kids’ club! — User9 (StarlightShopper): Honestly, I’m here for it. Silverburn might be onto something by not releasing a new ad for TV and instead keeping the focus on their centre. It builds a consistent brand image, especially before kickstarting a kids’ club. — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a genius marketing play if you ask me. Gloopy and Glitter are unique characters that have already grabbed attention. They’re perfectly prepped for mascot status, making the kids club launch potentially successful. — User8 (MerryDancer): Gotta admit, Gloopy and Glitter have grown on me, and if the rumors about them being club mascots are true, that’s pretty brilliant. Silverburn’s consistency vs. Braehead’s quick shift to defined alien characters will be an interesting contrast in marketing. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I hope the Gloopy and Glitter Kids Club (or whatever they’ll call it) has cool events and workshops. With the alien theme, they can get really creative. Can’t wait to see how much it’ll differ from the Brae-liens. — User11 (LostInFrost): Silverburn sticking to last year’s campaign surely keeps Gloopy & Glitter in our minds. It’s a less aggressive strategy compared to Braehead’s full-throttle move, but sometimes, slower and steadier wins the race—or in this case, wins the kids’ hearts! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Remember to keep an eye out for the official announcement regarding the kids’ club. We’re all anticipating how Silverburn will unveil Gloopy and Glitter’s next adventure! Keep the discussions friendly and out-of-this-world! And feel free to share any fun encounters with our favourite alien blobs you have in the meantime! 👽🛸 — Write a forum conversation the next year where TV’s ads have a cat saving Christmas from a theif, and 2 friends help him, The characters officially launched the kids club in February, Also, their love story ads are still showing in centre, along with the 2007 TV themed ones Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Christmas TV Campaign - A Heroic Cat & Throwback Ads! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Did anyone else catch Silverburn’s latest Christmas TV ad? A cat saving Christmas from a thief with a little help from two friends. Quite the twist from Gloopy and Glitter! But also, Silverburn launched that kids club back in February, remember? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Saw the new ad, the cat is absolutely adorable, and the message about teamwork is pure holiday spirit. And who could forget Gloopy and Glitter’s love story launching the kids club? They’ve become characters close to our hearts. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): I’m obsessed with the new ad! 🐱 The cat, the comedic timing—chef’s kiss. But in-centre, they’re still playing Gloopy and Glitter’s love story alongside the 2007 TV-themed ads. Seemingly, they’re not ready to let go of the nostalgia. — User5 (CarolSinger): Kinda loving this mix of new and old. It’s refreshing and yet comforting. The cat is already a favourite, but seeing Gloopy and Glitter also stirs up that cosy, festive vibe from before. — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Honestly, the mix is working for me. That cat from the ad could be our next mascot. 😂 Kids at the club must be loving the variety too. Silverburn’s finding a good rhythm with old and new content. — User7 (NoelTechie): Makes you wonder if they’re testing different themes or if it’s a strategy to cater to all tastes. Also, with all these mascots popping up, Silverburn’s becoming a character haven. — User8 (MerryDancer): Seeing those throwback ads from 2007 brings back memories… Time flies! Silverburn doing a great job of establishing their campaigns. And the TV-tree installation—still iconic! — User9 (StarlightShopper): It’s clever keeping the older ads in the mix; it provides a sense of continuity. But I’m interested to see how well the cat-themed merchandise will do compared to the Gloopy and Glitter craze. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Props to Silverburn for launching another creative ad. A cat hero? Brilliant. Also, seeing the TV-themed ads again really brings out that nostalgic festive feeling. Solid strategy to keep customers engaged over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Isn’t it fascinating how Silverburn keeps each year’s ads alive? It’s like walking through a living timeline of their marketing campaigns. Christmas is definitely in full swing there! — User11 (LostInFrost): Could the cat be signaling a shift for the next kids club theme, or is it just a seasonal mascot? It’s smart to use the main character from their new ad to maintain excitement post-holiday season. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Certainly seems like Silverburn knows how to strike a balance between introducing new holiday tales and cherishing the spirit of past campaigns. All while fostering a unique community through their kids club. Let’s keep sharing our festive ad encounters, be it the latest capers or a trip down memory lane! 🎄📺🐱 — Write a follow up in 2014 where the ad that year revolves around 2 familiar friends meeting Santa, their launch ads and the 2007 ones are still showing in centre, but they never added the 2009 cat, the 2010 robot, 2011 and 2012’s basic generic ad and 2013’s carousel, or this chapter in our favourite aliens’s story Thread Title: Silverburn Holidays 2014: Old Friends Meet Santa in New Ad! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): It’s that time of the year again! Silverburn’s festive ad for 2014 has our old friends meeting Santa. Love how they keep weaving continuity into their ads. 😊 But anyone else notice they’re not including the other ads from recent years in-centre? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Just saw the new ad! Nostalgic and heartwarming to see the ongoing story, especially during holidays. However, it’s kinda odd they skipped adding the cat from 2009, the 2010 robot, and the ads from 2011-2013 in their in-centre showcase. 🤔 — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yeah, I’ve got mixed feelings about them not showing the more recent ads in-centre. I mean, everybody loved the cat and the robot’s charm… Still, the 2014 ad with Santa has that special Christmas magic! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The new ad is full of cheer! But it’s clear Silverburn’s got its favourites with the continued run of the love story series and that 2007 campaign. A shame they don’t seem as invested in their other characters. — User7 (NoelTechie): Interesting marketing choice. Maybe they’re focusing on what resonates most with their audience? Though, it does feel like they’re missing an opportunity by not showcasing the full range of their past holiday creativity. — User5 (CarolSinger): Definitely missing the variety, particularly the 2009 cat—he was a hit with the kids. Maybe there’s a strategic reason behind their selection that we’re not seeing? — User8 (MerryDancer): In a way, the consistency is nice—gives you that “Silverburn Christmas” feeling. Each year I look forward to seeing how they’ll continue the story. But a little more diversity wouldn’t hurt, I agree. — User9 (StarlightShopper): That’s Silverburn for you—always keeping some parts the same and others changing. Guess we’re sticking to our “classic” friends for in-centre nostalgia. The carousel ad was quite dreamy, though; wish it was there too. — User6 (ElfEngineer): I thought the robot would’ve made an excellent recurring character. But hey, it’s kinda cool that the ads feel like an evolving holiday special that you can follow along with over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): It’s as if the love story ads and the 2007 TV themes have become their holiday brand staples. Not sure why they’re omitting the others; they were part of Silverburn’s festive journey too! — User11 (LostInFrost): Couldn’t help but chuckle at the meeting with Santa. Silverburn’s continuity is their strength, but including other ads would have showcased a richer history. I do enjoy the focused nostalgia, though. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The holiday season always brings a discussion of Silverburn’s latest festive strategies, and this year is no different. It’s wonderful to see everyone sharing their thoughts and fondness for past campaigns. Let’s remember to keep the conversation jolly as we discuss our old and potential new favourites from Silverburn’s Christmas ads! 🎅🎄 Character Description: Gloopy Appearance: Gloopy is an amorphous, enchanting alien with a body of translucent teal that glistens as if reflecting the depths of an ocean world. Gloopy’s form is ever-shifting, his gelatinous, blob-like structure giving him an air of gentle fluidity. Depending on his mood, he can shift from a bouncy ball to a languid puddle, often adorned with soft glimmers of bioluminescent speckles that twinkle like distant stars. His two large, expressive eyes gleam with a friendly, sapphire-blue glow that instantly endears him to all. Personality: Gloopy is the embodiment of chill and calm. He is carefree, always taking life at a leisurely pace (or float, as is more accurate for his kind). This gooey alien is innately kind, with an empathetic heart that resonates with the feelings of others. Despite his lack of a mouth, he has a way of communicating warmth and laughter through his shimmering form, and his bubbly personality makes him the soul of Silverburn’s extraterrestrial duo. Curious and playful, Gloopy loves to interact with the centre’s visitors, especially the children, making him a lovable part of many family memories. — Character Description: Glitter Appearance: Glitter stands as Gloopy’s vibrant counterpart with a sparkling, amorphous form that cascades through shades of radiant fuchsia and vivacious purple. Tiny specks of reflective gold are suspended in her body, giving her the appearance of a walking galaxy full of mysterious allure. Glitter can change shape at will, often settling into soft, rounded figures that exude both majesty and charm. Her one oversized, glistening eye catches the light, radiating an inviting and playful warmth in a rich magenta hue. Personality: Glitter is the adventurer of the pair, full of enthusiasm and an insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She embodies the joy of discovery and cannot resist the allure of an exciting new experience or a heartwarming interaction. Her vivacious nature is contagious, and she has a knack for spreading happiness and laughter wherever she goes. Though she communicates through harmonic vibrations that she emits, her intentions are always clear—Glitter wants to make the centre a brighter place for everyone. Dynamic and compassionate, she is the spark that keeps the spirit of Silverburn shining all year round. Together, Gloopy and Glitter are more than just Silverburn mascots—they are a delightful reminder of the unexpected and joyous moments that make the holiday seasons at Silverburn unique and memorable. Their contrasting personalities and appearances blend in perfect harmony, representing the diverse community that comes together at the shopping centre to celebrate the festive times. Write a blog post in early 2009 where it looks like Silver has been retired, and the poster welcomes the new mascots with open arms, Blog Title: Welcoming a Cosmic Duo: Silverburn’s New Mascots, Gloopy and Glitter! Date: February 5, 2009 Greetings fellow shoppers and extraterrestrial enthusiasts! Today marks the dawn of a new era at Silverburn Shopping Centre, and it is with both a touch of nostalgia and a wave of excitement that I bid a fond farewell to Silver, the shimmering mascot who has lit up the halls of our beloved centre with his twinkle and charm. But as we close one chapter, we eagerly turn the pages to begin another. It’s time to stretch out our arms—or tentacles—and welcome the cosmic presence of two gooey new icons: Gloopy and Glitter! Riding on the comet tail of Silver’s departure, Gloopy and Glitter arrive at Silverburn with a burst of interstellar energy and a kaleidoscope of colour that could rival the Aurora Borealis itself. These amorphous alien friends bring with them a sense of wonder and an invitation to explore the endless possibilities of the universe, much like the endless shopping opportunities at Silverburn. Both Gloopy and Glitter, with their sparkles and fluidity, embody the dynamic and ever-evolving experience that Silverburn offers to its patrons. They represent the melting pot of culture, fashion, and leisure that our shopping centre is known for. With Gloopy’s tranquil teal vibes and Glitter’s radiant fuchsia flare, they make an otherworldly pair that are impossible to ignore. Their introduction is not a moment too soon. As Silverburn embraces the future, the switch from our metallic buddy to these lovable blobs symbolizes the shopping centre’s commitment to innovation and excitement. What’s more fascinating is the inclusive narrative behind their existence—Gloopy and Glitter are not bound by shape or form, much like Silverburn’s diverse offerings are not limited to any single style or trend. As we welcome these enchanting mascots, let’s celebrate the magic they are set to sprinkle throughout our shopping escapades. Whether you’re a child marveling at the sight of Gloopy’s soothing, playful dances or an adult taken aback by Glitter’s adventurous aura, these mascots are sure to become an integral part of the Silverburn community. The excitement isn’t just confined to appearances, either. Buzz has it that Gloopy and Glitter are slated to be the faces of Silverburn’s very own kids’ club, set to launch this February. I envision days filled with laughter and engagement, where families can connect and create memories that are as vivid and joyful as our new alien friends. So as we say goodbye to Silver, I encourage all Silverburn visitors to approach Gloopy and Glitter with openness and curiosity. In the great expanse of our shopping galaxy, they are the bright stars guiding us toward fun-filled adventures. It is truly an exciting time to be part of Silverburn’s cosmic dance, and Gloopy and Glitter are poised to lead the way. Here’s to a future full of discovery, fun, and perhaps a little bit of space-age slime! Signing off with a sparkle, [Your Name] Silverburn Shopper and Self-Proclaimed Intergalactic Ambassador Write a forum conversation in 2013 after the centre gets a new logo, which was revealed by our friends, the idents have reduced to only 3, Pier, Balloons and Chairs, Also, the lines animation has been removed, Instead we get a peaceful animation of the mascots sleeping Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Logo Unveiled by Gloopy & Glitter + Updated Idents! — User1 (GlasgowGalactic): Just saw the new Silverburn logo reveal! Gloopy and Glitter did the honors—looks pretty sleek. What does everyone think? Also, seems like we’re down to just 3 idents now: Pier, Balloons, and Chairs! — User2 (RetailRevolutionary): The new logo’s sharp, a fresh take for Silverburn! But I am a bit surprised that they’ve cut down on the idents… I used to love the variety. And no more lines animation, now it’s our alien pals snoozing! — User3 (ZenShopper101): I’m all for the new minimalist approach with the idents. As for the sleeping animation of Gloopy and Glitter, it’s quite a peaceful way to end a shopping day, don’t you think? — User4 (ModConnoisseur): The new logo feels contemporary, fits the modern vibe of Silverburn. Cutting down on idents might be a move towards a more focused brand identity? I kinda miss the lines animation though. — User5 (ScreenSavvy): New logo looks good on the screens! The idents switch-up is interesting. Pier, Balloons, Chairs—they’ve kept the most iconic ones. Sleeping mascots are a cute, calming touch. — User6 (AdNostalgic): I’ll be honest, I do miss the variety, especially the old lines animation—had a digital art feel to it. But Silverburn’s all about change, I guess? The new logo is pretty cool at least. — User7 (TechieTrendsetter): Understandable they’re refreshing their visual content. The new logo’s got a futuristic edge. And Gloopy & Glitter napping? It feels… right. Like, bring on the Zen! — User8 (MascotManiac): Speaking about Gloopy & Glitter, I love how they’ve become more integrated into the centre’s identity. Yeah, the logo is nice, but it’s the mascots that really capture my heart! — User9 (VibeVisionary): Sure, fewer idents but each one’s got a story, right? Creating that chill vibe with the mascot’s sleeping animation is such a soothing concept. Aligns well with the new sleek logo, too. — User10 (NostalgiaKnight): The new logo’s got a certain ‘oomph’ to it. Cool to see them simplify things. The pier, balloons, and chairs are classics; they’ve got a universal appeal. But will the sleeping animation be as mesmerizing as the lines? Time will tell. — User11 (SleepyShopper): Kinda sad to see the lines go—they were hypnotic! But Gloopy & Glitter dozing off is adorable and oddly comforting? Shows a softer side of Silverburn, paired nicely with the new logo. It’s fresh! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Let’s embrace the new chapter Silverburn’s entered with its revamped branding! Whether you’re here for the logo, the iconic idents, or the heartwarming new animation, share your experiences and keep the discussions friendly and vibrant, just like Silverburn itself.

Date: June 12 2013 User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Heads up, shoppers! The weathered wallpaper at the old Pollok Centre has finally been upgraded after a whole decade! 😲 And guess who’s featured? Our amorphous ambassadors, Gloopy & Glitter, are now adorning the walls. What do you all think? User2 (RetroRevamp): About time for a refresh! The old wallpaper was falling apart. Nice to see the centre trying to keep up with the times, even if it’s just with wallpaper. Gloopy & Glitter certainly brighten up the place. 🎨 User3 (SavvyShopperSam): I’m a bit sentimental about the old view, but the new wallpaper is downright adorable. Only Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon left, huh? Feels like the end of an era at the old centre. 😔 User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): The Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper does add some life back to the area. I just hope they don’t forget about the value that Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon still bring to the community! User5 (DécorDevotee): Love the fresh vibes with the new wallpaper! Gloopy & Glitter have become Silverburn’s icons, so it’s a clever move. Makes the ol’ centre a bit more connected to Silverburn’s current brand. User6 (PollokPurist): I don’t know, feels like putting lipstick on a pig. The old centre has lost its charm, and no amount of cute alien blobs can replace the community spirit we once had. User7 (WallflowerWatcher): The new wallpaper is quite charming, though—bright and cheerful. It’s like a little piece of Silverburn’s vibrancy has leaked into the old centre. But it does make me wonder about its future… User8 (AlienAdmirer): Gloopy & Glitter’s presence is a smart marketing touch, no doubt. It does soften the blow of seeing the old centre so… empty. Still, I miss the hustle and bustle before Silverburn took over. User9 (HistoryHugger): I appreciate the effort to keep things looking nice, but part of me wishes we could preserve some of the old Pollok Centre’s authentic vibe. It’s important to remember where we started. User10 (CommunityCarol): New wallpaper or not, let’s not forget about supporting the remaining businesses at the old centre! Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon deserve our loyalty just as much. User11 (MuralMuse): Does anyone have pictures of the new Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper? Would love to see how it turned out. I can’t make it to the old centre for a while but still want to catch a glimpse of our jelly duo! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like the new wallpaper has sparked quite the discussion!

They’ve been emptied for a while now in prep. User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): Mixed feelings here. I get progress is inevitable, but tearing down the old centre hits right in the feels. At least Gloopy & Glitter are still in the mix, making the transition easier. User5 (DécorDevotee): From what I hear, the new Cineworld is going to be massive! 🎬 Might just become my new go-to spot. Those eateries are going to transform Silverburn into a dining haven, can’t wait! User6 (PollokPurist): Just when I thought I made peace with change, this happens. I understand growth, but I mourn the loss of our simple past. The old and the new—it’s a delicate balance. User7 (NewHorizons): It’s a sign of the times, folks! Out with the old, in with the new. This expansion is going to make Silverburn even more of a destination. And with Gloopy & Glitter on the teaser, I’m ready for it! User8 (AlienAdmirer): I’m curious about how the centre will look after the expansion. Are Gloopy & Glitter hinting at an interstellar-themed cinema complex, perhaps? One can only dream! User9 (HistoryHugger): As long as Silverburn remains mindful of its roots amidst this growth, I’m onboard. Sure, the nostalgia’s strong, but the potential here is huge.

User6 (EcoEnthusiast): Did anyone else notice the green elements incorporated into the new build? Solar panels, plant walls?

They commissioned the same creative minds behind their successful 2007 Christmas ads to fulfill the brief. The Brief: The challenge presented to the creative team was to conceptualize and design \\"abstract creatures that embody the centre\'s spirit.\\" These characters needed to be versatile, attractive to both children and adults, and adaptable to various marketing campaigns. Furthermore, these mascots were expected to be fully realized by October, with an animated Christmas ad to be produced in November. Silverburn planned to introduce the characters during the Christmas season and then fully launch them as centre ambassadors in February of the following year. Design Process: Brainstorming Stage: The creative team began by diving into the essence of Silverburn—its blend of fashion, entertainment, and dining, and its importance as a community hub. The goal was to distil these characteristics into a set of mascots that would personify the centre\'s vibrant and dynamic nature. Conceptualization: Abstract concepts were explored to avoid limiting the characters to any specific demographic or cultural representations. The team focused on attributes such as fluidity, brightness, and playfulness—components they felt resonated with Silverburn\'s brand identity. Character Creation: From the pool of concepts, two characters began to take shape—Gloopy, representing tranquility and inclusivity, and Glitter, exuding excitement and discovery. Gloopy was designed as a serene, teal blob that could shift shape, while Glitter took on a more energetic, sparkly fuchsia form. Both characters had a malleable nature, enabling them to engage in all forms of centre activities. Design Refinement: The characters went through several design iterations, receiving input from focus groups composed of Silverburn shoppers. Their feedback was instrumental in perfecting the characters\' appearances and ensuring their broad appeal. Animation: To meet the tight deadline, animators worked closely with the designers to bring Gloopy and Glitter to life. Their first animated appearance, the Christmas ad, was storyboarded and developed to showcase their personalities and interaction with the centre\'s environment. Christmas Introduction and Full Launch: Adhering to the project timeline, Gloopy and Glitter were successfully introduced to the public through a heartwarming Christmas ad that aired as planned. They were depicted spreading holiday cheer around the centre, captivating shoppers with their charm. The animated ad was well-received, paving the way for the full launch of the characters in February 2009. Outcomes: Gloopy and Glitter quickly became Silverburn\'s beloved mascots, the abstract embodiments of the shopping centre\'s lively and inclusive spirit. Shopper engagement increased, and the mascots became key to the centre’s brand identity, featuring in ongoing marketing campaigns, special events, and community activities. Their success has established them as iconic figures, enduring in shopper\'s minds and contributing significantly to Silverburn\'s brand image and appeal. Reflection: The development and success of Gloopy and Glitter demonstrate the importance of well-defined brand mascots. With careful design, attention to customer feedback, and strategic marketing integration, abstract characters can effectively capture and communicate a centre\'s spirit, enhancing overall customer experience and loyalty."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet where the concept process began just a few days before the \\"Switch on Christmas\\" campaign ended in late 2007","output":"Just learned that the beloved Gloopy & Glitter started as mere sketches days before \'07\'s \\"Switch on Christmas\\" at Silverburn ended.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how the ubiquitous scene of adolescents roaming the town mall after school and on weekends has long past into historical memory, even as teenagers who are glued to their smartphones have nothing better to do.","output":"Once emblematic of youthful liberty and social congregation, the sight of adolescents meandering through the town mall\'s labyrinth of retail outlets has faded into an echo of a bygone era. The imagery, poignant in its former prevalence, portrayed throngs of teens laughing over shared meals in the food court, vying for the latest fashion at buzzing storefronts, and pushing the boundaries of public space as a domain for their exuberant social exchanges. In contrast, today\'s teenagers are often depicted as captives of their digital devices, seemingly shackled to an infinite stream of content flowing from the glowing screens of their smartphones. The stark juxtaposition between the physical congregation of youth in a publicly shared venue and their present tendency to huddle individually over handheld screens is a testament to a cultural metamorphosis. On the surface, it can appear that these teenagers with their electronic appendages have little else to occupy their attention. A closer examination reveals that the allure of the town mall has waned not merely because of technology\'s siren call but due to a seismic shift in adolescent socialization, retail culture, and economic dynamics. The congregations that once brimmed with the vitality of teenage conversation and commerce have been supplaced by virtual forums, where dialogue and consumerist urges can be instantaneously sated from any location. Digital platforms have become the de facto marketplace, supplanting the once bustling corridors of brick-and-mortar establishments with virtual realms devoid of geographical or temporal constraints. The palpable excitement of in-person interaction and discovery while browsing through tangible goods has been quietly usurped by the rapidity and breadth of online shopping experiences, which proffer an endless bazaar at the fingertips. However, this shift extends beyond mere consumer behavior. The social fabric that wove adolescents into tightly knit clusters within mall environs has been unraveled by the very devices they cradle. Social media and instant messaging have fostered a new form of communion, where intimacy and immediacy eclipse the need for physical proximity. Interpersonal relationships among youths now flourish within a digital ecosystem that transcends the physical walls of any edifice. Hence, the melancholic demise of the town mall as a rallying point for local youth is not only a byproduct of changing consumer patterns but a reflection of a broader transformation in how adolescents connect and interact in a rapidly evolving social and technological landscape. In lieu of the raucous laughter and clatter that once reverberated off the tiled floors and reflective shopfronts, now there rests a hushed silence, punctuated only by the occasional shopper meandering past vacant real estate once occupied by vibrant stores teeming with the younger demographic. The era of adolescents saturating the common corridors of the town mall, indulging in the simple pleasure of \'hanging out,\' bears testimony to a historical narrative now rendered archaic, usurped by the silent symphony of taps and swipes on the screens accessible within the sanctum of one\'s palm."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, exposition-filled, descriptive, well-sourced fan theory for a crossover fanfiction between both Naruto and the Monster Girl Quest video game franchise and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia franchise in the form of a data log initially created by UN forces and added on by an organization seeking to restore the previous technological civilization before said organization went underground to avoid being chased by the Hidden Villages [Naruto] and the then-infant Akasuki [Naruto], found in a terminal set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or a fanfic or to the real world timeline at all, in which the events of the Monster Girl Quest games take place within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia but [the events of the Monster Girls Quest games within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia] occur before the rise of the Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] and the subsequent proliferation of chakra [Naruto] across the world via the Sage’s [Naruto] efforts, in which the rise of the so-called “monster girls” seen in both Monster Girl Quest and Monster Girl Encyclopedia occurs after a nuclear holocaust initiated by the Soviet Union due to the Soviets misinterpreting the NATO Able Archer exercise for a NATO strike on the Soviets destroys the post-WW2 industrial and soon to be digital global civilization, with Africa and the rest of the Third World both being wiped out both by the nuclear fallout and the release of bioweapons caused by the apocalypse and feudalism returning in Europe and East Asia after mankind there recovers from the apocalypse, but not before the emergence of the monster girls and the reemergence of magic, mythology and the gods of old. The legendary Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] did not save the world by introducing chakra [Naruto] to the world in the hopes of people getting to know each other, but [the sage] instead doomed it to be forever trapped in feudalism and mysticism due to his [the Sage’s] childish, delusional, overly optimistic and the Sage’s [Naruto’s] flawed understanding of humanity, as the fall of the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal monarchial crusader state Kingdom of Lescatie [Monster Girl Encyclopedia] to the monster girls just before the Sage [Naruto] gave chakra [Naruto] to the world, [Lescatie’s fall to the monster girls just before the Sage giving chakra to the world] ironically meant the end of any hope for civilization to recover just before the Sage gives chakra to the world.

Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"**UN FORCES DATA LOG #2954-TS** **Subject Classification:** Historical Anomaly and Post-Apocalyptic Societal Reconstruction Analysis **Security Clearance:** Level 4 - Top Confidential **Entry Creator:** Global Historical Studies Division - UN Special Archives **Additional Annotations By:** Technological Restoration Syndicate (TRS) - Before Going Underground --- **Historical Overview:** The catastrophic events leading to the current geopolitical landscape commenced with what was presumably a gross misinterpretation of NATO\'s Able Archer exercises by the Soviet Union. In a knee-jerk reaction, the Soviet\'s defensive stance escalated into an offensive nuclear strike, igniting a global thermonuclear war—a conflict that obliterated the delicate fabric of post-WWII civilization. The resulting nuclear fallout, compounded by the unintentional release of multiple bioengineering weapons, exerted an apocalyptic toll on life on Earth. Regions such as Africa and much of the developing world were devastated beyond immediate recovery, suffering immense casualties and infrastructural collapse. Surprisingly, amidst the global turmoil, Europe and East Asia, after a period of intense struggle, reverted to a state of neo-feudalism, forging new societies amidst the ashes of the old. **Anomalous Emergence and Societal Transformation:** It is during this time of immense suffering and transition that our records indicate a resurgence in the arcane and mythological, with the startling emergence of entities classified as \'monster girls.\' These beings, heretofore thought as fictional or archaic myth, appear to originate from a once-theoretical nexus between the universes of the \'Monster Girl Quest\' and \'Monster Girl Encyclopedia\' franchises. Their arrival coincided with the reactivation of ancient magical energies and a resurgence of forgotten gods and myths. **The Sage of Six Paths - Harbinger of the Chakra Era:** In the midst of this chaos and mystic reawakening, a figure of significant interest emerged—historically recognized as the Sage of Six Paths. Prior understandings suggested that this individual sought to share the power of chakra to unify humanity. However, TRS annotations suggest a divergence from this interpretation. It would appear that the intent was pure, but the result only entrenched the world further in cycles of war and feudalistic tendencies. The conclusive turn of events that quashed any hopes of a return to a pre-apocalyptic civilization occurred just prior to the dissemination of chakra. The fall of the Kingdom of Lescatie to the monster girls, an erstwhile stronghold against the mystical tide, marked a definitive end to the remnants of the old world, conceivably sealing the fates of global societies. **Hidden Villages and the Shadow of the Akatsuki:** The rise of the neo-ninjas and eventual formation of the \'Hidden Villages\' introduced a new order, with chakra wielders monopolizing technological remnants and engaging in a covert arms race identified by their control over Tailed Beasts. The Hidden Rain Village, formerly New York City, now stands as a notorious base for the clandestine group Akatsuki. **Rumors of Peace and Technological Symbiosis:** In stark contrast to the widespread disorder, rumors echo from the Far East of societies where monster girls, non-augmented humans, and chakra users coexist in relative harmony. As per TRS intelligence, it appears that a convergence of entities from narratives such as \'My Hero Academia,\' \'Date a Live,\' and \'Fire Force\' have found a shared reality in this setting. The Great Tokyo Empire has achieved a dominant presence throughout Japan and its historical territories, reinstating traditional governance systems and seemingly providing stability amidst the larger chaos. The appearance of \'Spirits\' in these regions represents another disruption to the already complex societal fabric, posing new challenges and necessitating revised strategies for coexistence. --- **Conclusion & Final Annotations:** The historical record compiled here represents a confluence of realities never before seen, producing an interwoven narrative of survival, cooperation, and perpetual conflict. As the last remnant of the TRS, we acknowledge that humanity, in seeking to reclaim its past glory, may have instead paved the way for a future that is forever entwined with the arcane and the chakra. Our legacy remains in this data log, preserved with the hope that one day the truth of these events will shine a light on the path to a new era—one that learns from the past and aspires to a unified future for all beings of this world. *Data log transmission end.* *All further TRS activity has moved to classified underground channels.*"},{"instruction":"Generate several callsigns from the Armored Core Non-Player Character pilots, as samples.

The streets teemed with busy workers seeking respite in their favorite cafes and restaurants - among them, the two indomitable women, Melissa and Mishaali. Melissa strode through the midday chaos, her presence an embodiment of confidence and poise. Standing at an impressive 6 feet tall, her muscular yet curvaceous figure was clothed in a form-fitting, sleeveless red dress that hugged every well-toned curve. The dress\'s hem danced just above her knees, showcasing her powerful legs, ones that had carried her victoriously through countless battles in the ring. Her fiery red hair was pulled back into a sleek, high ponytail that swayed in the breeze, while her long nails, painted an electric blue to match her piercing eyes, glinted in the sunlight. A few blocks away, Mishaali navigated through the crowd, her stance equally commanding. Wrapped in a fitted green jumpsuit that emphasized her hourglass silhouette, she moved like a panther – effortlessly graceful yet undeniably dangerous. With her dark, voluminous curls cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a warrior queen stepping out from a modern-day arena. Her nails, shaped to perfection and polished to a glossy onyx, were like the claws of a majestic feline ready to strike. Mishaali worked as an activity coordinator in an elder care building - a role that required her to design and supervise recreational programs for the residents, a task she carried out with genuine care and a no-nonsense attitude that had earned her respect from both colleagues and those she cared for. As fate would have it, Melissa and Mishaali, both heading for a quick bite at their favored health food grill, spotted each other from across the pedestrian-clogged street. Their eyes locked, steel clashing against iron, broadcasting a wordless challenge that murmured memories of two decades of fierce competition. They advanced, neither woman\'s gaze wavering, their approach weaving through the bustling habitat of the Californian midday. Onlookers felt the air shift, a tension that prickled the skin as these two forces of nature closed in on each other. Two powerful lionesses, each unwilling to yield. The two arch-rivals faced off without a word, energy crackling like a live wire between them. This was the tension of countless battles, a history written in bruises, sweat, and unwavering defiance that was now encapsulated in broad daylight under the indifferent California sun. Passersby steered clear, sensing the undercurrent of hostility, giving a wide berth to the titans before them. Their bodies spoke volumes, all those years of competition, of powerful roundhouse kicks, grappling on the mats, ferocious punches, and the struggle for dominance, each victory and loss adding another layer to their intricate dance of rivalry. Melissa and Mishaali stood there, minds alive with the thoughts of their personal quests for domination but bound by a sense of decorum that prevented them from unleashing their fury upon the streets. A silent truce formed in their mutual understanding – this was not the place for their fight. Today, they met as mothers and professionals, their roles outside the ring equally as defining as their identities within it. \\"Melissa,\\" Mishaali nodded, her voice a velvet threat. \\"Mishaali,\\" Melissa responded, her tone a razor-edged courtesy. The two lions, acknowledging each other with a tight but controlled respect, stepped into the establishment, each preparing for their subtle, psychological skirmish to play out over lunch. The world around them continued on its bustling way, blissfully unaware of the story of blood and sweat that soaked the histories of these two extraordinary women."},{"instruction":"Continue story in same style of writing.

The establishment was trendy and chic, a mosaic of modernity interlaced with rustic charm. Wooden tables with sleek metal frames stood alongside walls adorned with lush greenery, giving the impression of dining within an urban jungle. The ambient noise was a symphony of clinking cutlery, sizzling grills, and muffled conversations – a soothing hum for the usual clientele seeking a momentary escape from their daily grind. But for Melissa and Mishaali, this was no mere sanctuary. It was a battleground in disguise, a place where words and wills would collide with as much force as fists and feet did in the ring. As they walked toward each other, their tart smiles concealed the snarl of their inner warriors. The air crackled with the electricity of their barely contained animosity, amplified by the deafening silence that fell upon their path as they moved closer. \\"I see the years haven\'t taught you to avoid my territory, Mishaali,\\" Melissa said, her voice low and steady as she stood just inches away from her rival, eyes sparkling with the eager blaze of combat that bubbled beneath the surface. Mishaali, poised with an air of indifference that belied her inner tension, tilted her head slightly, her own eyes shimmering with an icy fire. \\"And I see the years haven\'t humbled you, Melissa. Still stepping out of your office to try your hand where real power lies?\\" Their postures mirrored each other: shoulders back, chins lifted, their imposing figures like statues sculpted to intimidate. Onlookers, sensing the undercurrent of hostility, glanced nervously between their plates and the two women, wondering if this lunch hour might unfold into an unexpected spectacle. \\"Real power?\\" Melissa chuckled, her laughter devoid of warmth. \\"You forget, Mishaali, I\'ve knocked you to the ground more times than you care to admit.\\" A flex of Mishaali\'s jaw betrayed her growing ire. \\"Memories seem to fail you, dear rival. But it\'s good to see you haven\'t lost that overconfidence—it always made defeating you more satisfying.\\" Their banter was razor wire wrapped in velvet, each jibe and retort a masterstroke in their ongoing psychological warfare. As they faced off, the air around them felt heavy, charged with the echoes of their past encounters and the unspoken promise of those yet to come. With an imperceptible nod, they simultaneously chose a table, sitting down with the calm precision of chess grandmasters opening a pivotal game. They maintained an arm\'s length distance, their bodies tense yet controlled, like coiled springs ready to unleash at the slightest provocation. The undeniable strength in their limbs was evident, their attire continuing to accentuate their formidable physiques and the aura of might they carried. Melissa\'s sinewy forearms rested on the table, betraying the power that lay within, while Mishaali\'s toned legs, visible through the slit in her jumpsuit, exuded a silent threat. \\"So, shall we dine, or is there a hidden agenda today?\\" Melissa asked, her eyes never straying from Mishaali\'s. Mishaali gave a mirthless smile, \\"I came for a meal, though I wouldn\'t put it past you to turn even this into a match.\\" The server approached, eager yet apprehensive to take their orders, almost tiptoeing into the ring that had unwittingly been drawn around these two titans. The usual hum of the grill resumed as Melissa and Mishaali turned their laser-focused attention to the menu, their battle left simmering on the back burner—for now."},{"instruction":"Rewrite: Continue story in same style of writing.

Amidst the warm ambiance, accented by the exposed brick walls and suspended Edison bulbs casting a soft golden hue, Melissa and Mishaali found themselves navigating through a sea of tables bustling with patrons— each table a small island of everyday life. A secluded spot caught their eyes: a table for two set apart from the rest, positioned near a floor-to-ceiling window draped with a sheer green ivy which let in diffused light, creating a semi-private sphere away from the curious ears of the world outside. They advanced with determined strides, each step an understated dance of power, muscles subtly flexing beneath the tailored finesse of their attire. As they took their seats, their presence commanded the space with an undisguised ferocity. Melisa\'s athletic form perched on the chair with the grace of a predator at rest, her piercing blue eyes locking onto Mishaali, an equally formidable opponent whose own gaze bore the weight of their shared animosity. “Given our history, I’m surprised we can still be mistaken for friends in public, Mishaali,” Melissa began, her words smooth like the polished surface of a blade drawn in the open, a snarl barely concealed behind her artful composure. Mishaali leaned forward slightly, acknowledging the irony with a cold smile that never reached her calculating, dark eyes. “Perhaps it’s a testament to our self-control, Melissa. Or the public’s love for an idealized image of two strong, attractive women sitting side by side.” Their laughter, short and devoid of true amusement, flirted with the lines of genuine conviviality and veiled aggression. To the unsuspecting onlooker, they might have appeared to be businesswomen sharing a casual meal, their laughter blending seamlessly with the background symphony of exchanges around them. “We can entertain their fantasies,” Melissa continued, picking up the menu with the deliberate motion of her manicured hand. “After all, it’s performance that keeps the crowds coming back, isn’t it?” “Indeed,” Mishaali replied, her eyes momentarily scanning the menu before locking back onto Melissa\'s. “But let\'s not forget, it’s the genuine clash of titans that proves truly unforgettable.” Their dialogue was a duel disguised as polite small talk, each phrase a thrust and parry, a reflection of their endless contest for one-upmanship. Their athletic forms, while seemingly relaxed in their seats, were poised with alertness, like coiled serpents ready to strike. As they placed their orders, with practiced smiles and a seamless facade, the other patrons gave no indication of the undercurrent streaming between the two women. They sat, seemingly peaceful, in their chosen arena – the sound of their voices a low murmur lost in the lunchtime noise. For now, their battle would continue with words, carefully chosen and expertly delivered, the heat of their rivalry simmering just below the surface."},{"instruction":"Rewrite one more time: Continue story in same style of writing.

Not with clenched fists or strained muscles, but with sharpened words and piercing glares that could slice through steel. The two femme fatales navigated towards a table for two, strategically set away from the hum of the bustling establishment. A delicate arrangement of potted succulents adorned the center, adding a touch of serenity to a scene boiling with unseen tension. Here, in this corner bathed in the muted glow of stylish pendant lights, they chose to sit, where their venomous exchange would not reach the ears of the casual observer. To the world, they portrayed a scene of camaraderie: two statuesque, sophisticated, and strikingly beautiful women catching up over a meal. Yet, as they settled into their chairs, a snarl flickered across each of their faces, so fleeting it could be mistaken for a trick of the light. “I would say it’s a pleasure to see you outside the ring, Mishaali, but we both know that would be a lie,” Melissa seethed under her breath, her posture radiating the regal fury of a queen offended. Mishaali’s lips curved into a sardonic smile, “The pleasure, Melissa, is all in knowing that even as a part-time secretary, you’re still grappling to match my success.” Her eyes glinted with scorn, unwavering in their intensity. A chuckle, dark and menacing, escaped Melissa’s throat. “I merely chose to apply my strength where it counts, instead of playing caregiver to those already one foot in the grave,” she countered coolly, a statement designed to cut deep. “Funny, considering how often I\'ve visited you in the clutches of defeat. I guess your strength only applies selectively,” Mishaali jested, her words a velvet-covered dagger. The barbs they traded were coated in the cloak of professional and personal jabs, each one a testament to their history of rivalry that had spanned the better part of two decades. They were so engrossed in their mutual hostility that they scarcely noticed the silent approach of the young waiter, drawn to their table by the sheer magnetism of their presence. It was only when his shadow loomed over their table, a polite cough escaping his lips, that they snapped from their trance, their masked animosities quickly giving way to composed smiles. “Ladies,” the waiter began, the youthfulness of his voice a stark contrast to the gravity that hung between them, “may I take your order?” Melissa and Mishaali turned their attention to him, their expressions transforming in an instant into the very picture of professionalism. “Yes, of course,” Melissa replied smoothly, her tone light and devoid of the earlier frost. “I’ll have the grilled kale and quinoa salad,” Mishaali added in a practiced, courteous manner, her gaze briefly meeting the waiter’s before locking back onto Melissa with an intensity that no one else could decipher. The waiter, blissfully unaware of the undercurrents swirling beneath their polished exteriors, nodded and excused himself, leaving them once again in their insulated bubble. As he departed, the space between them felt charged once more with their silent declarations of war.

He was, undeniably, a picture of toned, youthful vigor, his attire failing to fully conceal the athleticism beneath. Both women, ever the competitors, saw yet another silent battlefield open up before them – the challenge to ensnare the young man\'s attention. Melissa tilted her head slightly, her blue eyes softening as she spoke, her once snarled lips now curved into a warm, inviting smile. “I’ll start with the spring garden soup, and the citrus-infused salmon for my main, please,” she ordered, her voice honeyed, each word laced with a subtle, entrancing melody designed to captivate. Mishaali countered with equal charm, her own voice a sultry symphony as she gave her order. “And I’ll have the avocado tartare to begin with, followed by the herb-crusted lamb chops, medium-rare,” her words punctuated with a playful wink, her smile stretching into one of flawless, enticing poise. The waiter stumbled over his words, coloring slightly as he found himself caught in this unforeseen crossfire of allure. “Of c-course,” he stammered, trying to regain his composure, even as his pulse quickened under the gaze of these two Aphrodites. “I’ll get those orders in for you right away.” As he turned to leave, his notepad gripped a little too tightly, the women\'s smiles lingered, softly fading as their attention swung back to each other, their eyes locking once more in silent, mutual challenge. The congeniality melted away as quickly as it had appeared, the rivalry snapping back into place with the ease of a habit long honed. The atmosphere reverberated with the seething electricity emanating from their proximity. Melissa\'s voice dipped, threaded with derision. “That was quite the performance, Mishaali. But then again, having to mask your true nature must be second nature to you.” “Please, Melissa,” Mishaali retorted, her laughter shadowed by malice. “Your act could fool a child, but remember who you’re dealing with. The only mask here is the façade you put up to hide how much you hate being second best.” Their exchange was a dance of words, swift and lethal, the subtleness of their battle fought as much in the spaces between their phrases as in the words themselves. It was a ritual danced around the core of their shared passion – the love for their sons, the one area of equal footing where animosity gave way to respect. Their verbal sparring slowed as the conversation shifted, a current of pride and maternal affection warming the cool currents of rivalry. “Sergio’s soccer game is this weekend,” Melissa offered, her competition softening into pride. “He’s starting forward.” Mishaali nodded, her features softening by a nearly imperceptible degree. “That’s wonderful. Yamir is leading his science team to regionals. The project they devised is rather ingenious.” In this moment, the storms of their competitive rage settled into a mutual understanding – the love they each harbored for their sons, a place where even fierce rivals could find common ground. These two powerful, indomitable mothers shared a passion for their children\'s successes that transcended their desire for personal victory. And in this rare moment of shared silence, the grill buzzed around them, oblivious to the layers of conversation that had unfurled between these two queens of combat."},{"instruction":"As they continue eating, both women continue having a rare friendly chat as they speak about their sons and jobs, include dialogue.

Over bites of her citrus-infused salmon, Melissa\'s face relaxed into a rare smile, softened by maternal pride. \\"Sergio\'s coach says he has potential for a scholarship if he keeps at it,\\" she shared, the toughness in her voice replaced with something akin to warmth. Mishaali\'s response was equally unguarded as she delicately speared a piece of her avocado tartare. \\"Yamir\'s talking about MIT or Caltech. His teachers say his mind is built for engineering,\\" she said, a shimmer of anticipation lighting up her dark eyes. For a fleeting period, their conversational volleys consisted of anecdotes and aspirations surrounding their boys and the common ground of motherhood, building an ephemeral bridge over the chasm of their rivalry. As the final forkfuls of their meal were consumed, the request for the check saw their temporary truce dissolve. The clipped formality of their previous interactions resurfaced as the waiter approached with the bill. Sensing an opportunity, Melissa smoothly rose from her seat, intercepting the waiter with a fluid step. She handed him her card with a sly wink and leaned in, her voice a purr. \\"For your outstanding service,\\" she purred, as her fingers deliberately brushed across his hand in a gesture charged with intent. The faintest flush spread across his cheeks, betraying the effectiveness of her move. Mishaali watched, her annoyance simmering just below the surface, her competitive spirit reigniting like dry kindling at the touch of a spark. She scowled as Melissa sauntered back to the table with the grace of a conqueror. As soon as Melissa seated herself, Mishaali\'s voice lashed out, sharp and cold, \\"Can\'t resist flaunting, can you? Even outside of the ring, you\'re desperate for attention.\\" Melissa coolly met her gaze, an icy laugh escaping her lips. \\"I do what\'s necessary to win, Mishaali. You of all people should understand that. In the ring or at lunch, it seems.\\" Their spat escalated once more, each jab whittling away the veneer of cordiality they had momentarily donned. The friendly chatter about their sons and jobs dissolved back into the corrosion of rivalry, as if the mere concept of peace between them were no more than a mirage. Finally, Mishaali leaned back, her lips curling into a sneer of challenge. \\"Enough of this pretense. We both know there\'s only one way to settle today\'s...dispute.\\" Melissa\'s eyes lit up with the same fierce glow that heralded their legendary showdowns. \\"Agreed,\\" she said, her voice now a growl, reverting to their primal, familiar dynamic. \\"A fight to knockout, just as it should be.\\" The intensity of their mutual agreement hung like a charged storm cloud between them. They understood the language of combat better than any words of peace; it was the truest medium through which they communicated, through which they lived. Underneath the civil decorum of their lunch was the unquenchable flame of their rivalry, burning ever brighter with each passing moment, only to be extinguished in the ring where power and prowess were the ultimate words exchanged."},{"instruction":"Rewrite: As they continue eating, both women continue having a rare friendly chat as they speak about their sons and jobs, include dialogue. When finished, both women ask for the check and the young man comes in with the check. Wanting to one up her rival, Melissa stands up and walks to him as he approached them, she gives him her card to pay with full tip included and something else to make him get extra hot (Describe in details).

End prompt, will continue in next prompt","output":"The tête-à-tête over their gourmet dishes had taken an unexpected turn, steering into the calm waters of their lives beyond the rivalry. Between bites, Melissa spoke of Sergio\'s agility on the soccer field, her usually steely tone softening with pride. \\"He\'s got this fearlessness in his eyes every time he takes to the pitch... just like his mother, I suppose.\\" A hint of a genuine smile flitted over Mishaali\'s lips as she delicately pinched a lamb chop with her fork. \\"Yamir stays up night after night working on his projects. His dedication... I can\'t help but respect it.\\" However, as their meal concluded and they considered the bill, the congenial atmosphere began to dissipate. The waiter, returning with the check in hand, set it down unassumingly between them – a delicate invitation to resume their habitual antagonism. Melissa, seizing the moment with a predator\'s instinct, rose gracefully from her seat under the pretense of cordiality. Intercepting the waiter with her tall, assertive stance, she handed over her card while sliding something discreetly into his palm – a tip so generous it left him momentarily dumbfounded, a subtle bead of perspiration forming on his brow under her intense, blue gaze. Mishaali watched with a jagged edge of envy, her teeth nearly grinding as she plotted her countermove. When Melissa returned, flaunting her small victory with a smug grin, Mishaali launched her verbal assault. \\"Always playing to the audience, eh Melissa? Such grandstanding even without the roar of the crowd.\\" Unperturbed, Melissa sat, her expression as composed as ever. \\"It\'s called being generous. Maybe if you tried it, you\'d understand the response it gets.\\" The acrimony between them spiked as they spat disparaging remarks, lobbing insults with the same dexterity as they would punches and kicks. The tension between them became a palpable entity, a third guest at their private table of enmity. Seizing her opportunity, Mishaali signaled the waiter, noting the jar of water he was carrying with feigned innocence. \\"Some water, please,\\" she said, her voice dripping with sweetness. He complied, pouring her a glass, but as Melissa signed the check, a sharp nudge sent the water cascading across the table, soaking into Melissa\'s lap. The waiter\'s eyes widened in horror, and he quickly retreated to fetch a towel. Mishaali feigned shock, covering a sly smirk. \\"Oh, how clumsy of me, Melissa. How will you attend your knockout match like that?\\" Melissa, dripping and fuming, shot back, \\"At least I don\'t need excuses for my victories, Mishaali. And tonight, you\'ll be the one knocked out.\\" The charge in the air could have ignited the very air around them. Battle lines were drawn over the drenched divide of the table, their verbal war escalating once more. It was decided, as it always was, their conflict could only truly be settled in the combat they both lived for – a fight to the knockout. As Mishaali exited, she caught the young, flustered waiter rushing back with the towel. With a flicker of a smirk, and a hand caressing his arm, she whispered, \\"Keep it.\\" Slipping him an additional tip, she left him riveted in place. Melissa, left waiting and wet, could only simmer in her darkened mood, the anticipation for their impending clash growing stronger with each passing second. Her eyes were already on the ring, envisioning the only resolution these warriors would accept – a decisive, unambiguous victory."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, exposition-filled, descriptive, well-sourced fan theory for a crossover fanfiction between both Naruto and the Monster Girl Quest video game franchise and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia franchise in the form of a data log initially created by UN forces and added on by an organization seeking to restore the previous technological civilization before said organization went underground to avoid being chased by the Hidden Villages [Naruto] and the then-infant Akasuki [Naruto], found in a terminal set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or a fanfic or to the real world timeline at all, in which the events of the Monster Girl Quest games take place within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia but [the events of the Monster Girls Quest games within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia] occur before the rise of the Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] and the subsequent proliferation of chakra [Naruto] across the world via the Sage’s [Naruto] efforts, in which the rise of the so-called “monster girls” seen in both Monster Girl Quest and Monster Girl Encyclopedia occurs after a nuclear holocaust initiated by the Soviet Union due to the Soviets misinterpreting the NATO Able Archer exercise for a NATO strike on the Soviets destroys the post-WW2 industrial and soon to be digital global civilization, with Africa and the rest of the Third World both being wiped out both by the nuclear fallout and the release of bioweapons caused by the apocalypse and feudalism returning in Europe and East Asia after mankind there recovers from the apocalypse, but not before the emergence of the monster girls and the reemergence of magic, mythology and the gods of old. The legendary Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] did not save the world by introducing chakra [Naruto] to the world in the hopes of people getting to know each other, but [the sage] instead doomed it to be forever trapped in feudalism and mysticism due to his [the Sage’s] childish, delusional, overly optimistic and the Sage’s [Naruto’s] flawed understanding of humanity, as the fall of the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal monarchial crusader state Kingdom of Lescatie [Monster Girl Encyclopedia] to the monster girls just before the Sage [Naruto] gave chakra [Naruto] to the world, [Lescatie’s fall to the monster girls just before the Sage giving chakra to the world] ironically meant the end of any hope for civilization to recover just before the Sage gives chakra to the world. The emergence of the so-called Hidden Villages [Naruto] from the so-called “neo-ninjas”, mercenaries with the ability to use chakra posing as the legendary shinobi of Japan’s feudal and early Meiji era, [the “neo-ninjas”] [the rise of the “neo-ninjas”] also further ruins things as the Hidden Villages [Naruto] monopolize technology and [the Hidden Villages] keep the Tailed Beasts [Naruto] between themselves [the Hidden Villages] in an arms race surprisingly similar to that between the USSR and the USA during the Cold War, with the area once known as New York before the nuclear apocalypse, now known post-apocalypse as the Hidden Rain Village [Naruto] having become the base of Akasuki [Naruto] while rumors of technologically advanced civilizations where monster girls, normal humans and chakra users co-exist in peace are heard in the Far East, hinting at a crossover between My Hero Academia, Date a Live and Fire Force where the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia] never rose to power due to the nuclear apocalypse and as a result, Quirk [My Hero Academia] supremacy and the Hero [My Hero Academia] system never took off in the parts of post-apocalyptic Japan with working advanced technology, allowing the Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] to [the Great Tokyo Empire in this scenario] expand beyond Tokyo and [the Great Tokyo Empire in this scenario] conquer all of Japan, [the Great Tokyo Empire in this scenario] even reclaiming the post-WW2 lost Japanese provinces of Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils and restoring Manchukuo and the Qing Imperial Family, the Aisin-Gioros in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, the Mongolian United Autonomous Government and the Genghis-Khan descended Imperial House of Borjhin in Inner Mongolia’s Charhar and Suiyan’s regions, the Kumul Khanate and the Imperial House of Chagatai in East Turkestan, the Llamas and the Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet and the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled by the descendants of the Ming Imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu in Han China along with the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast, although the emergence of Spirits [Date a Live] in recent years seems to have complicated things.

The fallout decimated the global human population with a disproportionate toll on Africa and other \\"Third World\\" nations. Paralleling the Dark Ages of Old Earth, feudalism reemerged as survivors clung to primitive social constructs amidst the dust of fallen cities. Yet, the radioactive ashes birthed an esoteric phenomenon: the rise of \\"monster girls,\\" beings akin to mythical creatures of yore. Magic and the ancient gods have reasserted their presence. The realm bristles with the arcane, undoing the dominance of technology and science. --- **Addendum (circa the Fall of Lescatie):** The Fall of Lescatie symbolized a pivotal junction in history. The crusader state stood as the last bastion of hope for a return to pre-apocalyptic civilization, rejecting the growing influence of monster girls and the sorcery they represented. Its collapse marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new age shrouded in mysticism. During this precarious period, the narrative glorifying the Sage of Six Paths emerged – a figure mythical in stature, posited to have offered the world chakra as a bridge to unity and understanding. Yet historical analysis suggests this was the Sage\'s folly: rather than elevating humanity, the propagation of chakra fostered a perpetual state of feudal unrest. Through chakra, the Sage unintentionally cemented a fractious world, dominated by Hidden Villages and the neo-ninjas that wielded its power. Interestingly, despite chakra\'s widespread influence, rumors persist of enclaves that maintain technological prowess, intricately weaving magic, machinery, and chakra. In the Far East, a supposed technocratic empire – the Great Tokyo Empire – thrives, integrating monster girls, chakra users, and unaltered humans into a cohesive society. However, the emergence of Spirits distorts an already complex societal fabric. **End of Addendum** --- **Additional Notes:** Post-apocalyptic geopolitics reflect an eerie parallel to the Cold War, with Hidden Villages monopolizing chakra and Tailed Beasts in a manner reminiscent of the U.S.-Soviet arms race. Notably, the region once identified as New York, now dubbed Hidden Rain Village, serves as the nexus for the nascent and treacherous Akatsuki organization. **[Data Corruption at 68% – Subsequent Sections Lost]** *Remaining fragments hint at the geopolitical landscape shaped by ever-shifting alliances and rival factions (akin to the world before the fall). Notable mentions of restored monarchies, culturally revived provinces, and testimonies about technological marvels surviving in remote lands suggest a world compartmentalized into varying degrees of progress and magical integration.* **[Data Retrieval Attempt Failed]** --- **LPS Commentary [Logged Post-Recovery]:** The scourge of chakra, seen by the Sage as an olive branch, binds us to an anachronistic existence. As much as Lescatie\'s demise wrought irreversible change, the Sage\'s choice assured humanity\'s trap in an endless cycle of conflict and slow progression. LPS research aims to unearth pre-apocalyptic technology in aid of a unified civilization that can neither reject our mystical reality nor be consumed by it. Our ancestors once searched the stars – it is imperative we honor that legacy by rekindling a flame of innovation among the ashes of old. Suspicion flourishes regarding a far-reaching conspiracy, suppressing historical truths to maintain the current structures of power. LPS diligence has confirmed the presence of a stable, if shrouded, civilization beyond the Great Tokyo Empire. Despite current strife with Spirits and the rule of chakra, there could yet live a society where past, present, and future converge into a symphonic testament to human resilience.

Reflecting on the significant 40 days they spent in their homeland, the students promised to meet again in the future.

What was the stage like for the performance that lasted about 5 minutes? Ji Rigu: I was excited to think that we were going to perform on the same stage as the students from our homeland. We performed six times (afternoon of December 31st, afternoon of January 4th, morning and afternoon of January 6th, morning and afternoon of January 7th), and the first performance was more nerve-wracking than I imagined. However, as we continued to perform, I was able to calm down. For the last performance, I thought about the expectations and trust of the zainichi (resident Koreans in Japan) for our art troupe and stood on the stage. Ju Sun-mi: When I transferred to my school in the first year of middle school, I thought I couldn\'t communicate with people from my homeland. But the people from my homeland understood my clumsy speaking. That\'s when I felt connected with my homeland. I performed with the determination to repay the love given to us by the people of my homeland. Yang Mi-ga: From the Pyongyang Hotel where we stayed to the training venue, the Pyongyang Grand Theater, it was a 3-minute walk. Despite the cold weather and icy roads making it dangerous, a driver always provided us with a bus, and we all vividly remember such consideration from our homeland. Heo Ryong-uk: I felt the loving gaze from the people who watched our performance, and their clapping and response to our show were impressive. I thought it was a sign of the people\'s hearts considering us as \\"HanSolo.\\" Lee Do-kyung: I really think it was good that I came to my homeland. At first, I was just curious and wanted to improve my abilities in my homeland, but now I think about my homeland in a different dimension. The love of the homeland can only be felt by living there. Kang Myung-sook: I feel the same way. I also participated in the New Year\'s performance during elementary school, and the love from my homeland was unchanged then and now. We lived without any inconvenience. The performance in response to the love from my homeland was unforgettable. Moderator: What did you learn during your stay in the homeland, and what changes did you experience? Yang Mi-ga: When I was not feeling well, my friends gave me strength. They even worried if there was anything I wanted to eat. I learned how much strength you can give to someone when you do something for others. Kang Myung-sook: There were moments when I saw a friend crying and opening up about their worries. Each time, both friends and teachers warmly helped. It was a time to cherish the importance of trust and love. Heo Ryong-uk: The joy of setting a goal with friends and achieving it is indescribable. I learned the true meaning of unity through experience. Lee Do-kyung: Working together can achieve greater results than just one person working hard. The sense of accomplishment from all 121 of us working together with one heart is something that can’t be experienced in Japan. Moderator: Are there any scenes or words that have left a deep impression on you? Lee Do-kyung: Two dance instructors said to us, \\"Because we live in the distant land called Japan, we can shape this work well.\\" Hearing this, I realized that not only is training intensity and artistic skills important but also that we must put the unique emotional world of zainichi into our work. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>: I was ashamed of my low level of performance. One day, a junior from Kyushu Korean High School said, \\"Let\'s make our school proud.\\" His point that my performance, my presence, represents Kyushu Korean High School encouraged me. Ji Rigu: I had a similar experience. One day, a singing teacher yelled at us, \\"Sing with your heart.\\" Usually, the teacher never complains about being tired and always smiles while guiding us. That one line from the teacher made all of us in the vocal section work even harder. Yang Mi-ga: A similar experience comes to mind. During training, a friend said, \\"Because we\'re going through the same hardship, our hearts connect. We can definitely overcome difficult challenges.\\" The harder the training got, the more I remembered these words, and the more my fellow trainees felt like old friends, giving me strength. Moderator: As a member of the art troupe, what do you think should not be forgotten? Heo Ryong-uk: Marshal Kim Jong-un trusts us as fellow Koreans, even though we live abroad.

Reflecting on the meaningful forty days spent in their homeland, the students promised to meet again in the future. Kyushu Korean Middle and High School student Joo Seon-mi (high school 2nd year, instrumentalist) Higashiosaka Korean Middle School student Ji Ri-gu (middle school 2nd year, vocalist) Hokkaido Korean Elementary, Middle and High School student Yang Mi-ga (middle school 2nd year, dancer) Tokyo Korean Middle and High School student Kang Myeong-sook (middle school 2nd year, dancer) Nishitokyo Korean First Junior High School student Heo Ryong-wook (middle school 2nd year, vocalist) Nishikobe Korean Elementary School student Ri Do-kyung (6th grade, dancer) Moderator – Reporter from this company Moderator: The students shed hot tears right after their performance. What was the stage like for the approximately 5-minute performance? Ji Ri-gu: I was excited to think that I would be on the same stage as the students of our homeland. We performed six times (the afternoon of December 31, the afternoon of January 4, the morning and afternoon of January 6, and the morning and afternoon of January 7), and I was extremely nervous for the first performance, beyond imagination. But as we continued to perform, I was able to calm down. For the last performance, I took the stage considering the expectation and trust of the fellow Koreans in Japan for our troupe. Joo Seon-mi: When I transferred to my school in the first year of middle school, I thought I couldn\'t converse with people from my homeland. But the people of my homeland understood even my clumsy language. That\'s when I felt a connection with my homeland. I joined the performance with the single-minded intention of repaying the love given to us by the people of my homeland. Yang Mi-ga: From the Pyongyang Hotel where we stayed to the Pyongyang Grand Theatre where we trained, it was only a three-minute walk, but the drivers took us by bus each day because the weather was cold and the road was frozen and slippery. All the students vividly remembered such care from our homeland. Heo Ryong-wook: I felt the loving gaze of the people who watched our performance. The way they clapped and responded to our performance was also impressive. I thought that it was an expression of the people\'s hearts, considering us as part of \\"Hansiksol\\" (compatriots). Ri Do-kyung: I thought it was a really good decision to come to my homeland. At first, I was just curious and wanted to improve my skills in my homeland, but now my thoughts about my homeland have reached another level. The love of the homeland can only be felt by living there. Kang Myeong-sook: I feel the same way. I participated in the Seolnal performance even during the elementary school period, and the love from the homeland was unchanged then and now. We lived without any discomfort. The stage, in response to the love of the homeland, is unforgettable. Moderator: What did you learn during your stay in the homeland, and what changes did you experience? Yang Mi-ga: When I was not in good physical condition, my friends encouraged me and worried about whether I had anything I wanted to eat. I realized how much strength helping others can give to the person receiving help. Kang Myeong-sook: There was a friend who cried and confided their worries. Whenever this happened, both friends and teachers warmly helped us. It was a time of treasuring the importance of trust and love. Heo Ryong-wook: The joy of achieving a goal together with friends is indescribable. I learned the meaning of unity through experience. Ri Do-kyung: No matter what, sticking together achieves better results than just one person working hard. When all 121 of us united as one heart to successfully bring the work to life, the feeling of accomplishment was something we couldn\'t feel in Japan. Moderator: Are there any scenes or words that left a deep impression? Ri Do-kyung: Two dance instructors said, \\"Because we live in a foreign land called Japan, we can properly portray this work.\\" Hearing this, I was motivated to not only focus on training intensity and artistic skills but to also strive to incorporate the unique emotional world of Koreans in Japan into the work. Joo Seon-mi: I was ashamed of my low level of performance. One day, a junior from Kyushu Korean High said, \\"Let\'s be proud of our school.\\" His comment that my performance, my appearance, represented Kyushu Korean High, spurred me to strive harder. Ji Ri-gu: I had a similar experience. One day, a teacher of the vocal group scolded us loudly, saying, \\"Sing with your heart.\\" The teacher always guided us with a smile, without mentioning tiredness. All the members of the vocal group were inspired to work harder by that one remark. Yang Mi-ga: A similar experience comes to mind. During training, one friend said, \\"We understand each other because we\'re going through the same hardships. We can certainly overcome the difficult challenges.\\" As the training intensity increased, I kept recalling these words, feeling the friends beside me like old friends, giving me strength. Moderator: As a member of the art troupe, what do you think is something you should not forget? Heo Ryong-wook: Comrade Kim Jong-un believes that we are the same Korean people even though we live overseas. We must not forget that we are his Hansiksol. Joo Seon-mi: We must live with the pride and confidence that we are Korean and the love of our homeland until the end. Moderator: When you return to Japan, you will disperse and enjoy school life again. Ji Ri-gu: We made a promise in Pyongyang. Let\'s definitely meet again. The 121 students and 7 teachers value the relationship created once and will carry out the determination forged on the Seolnal stage."},{"instruction":"DMU A B C D Period t Output yt 3.5 1.283 5.37 8.5 Input xt 8 3 6 15 Period t+1 Output yt+1 7 1,5 6 10 Input xt+1 14 3 6 15 The Ministry of Industry has published a report in which among other things says: “We are especially proud of the evolution of our industry.

When a critical strategic initiative at a major multinational stalled recently, company leaders targeted a talented, up-and-coming executive to take over the project. There was just one problem: she was already working 18-hour days, five days a week. When the leaders put this to the CEO, he matter-of-factly remarked that by his count she still had “30 more hours Monday to Friday, plus 48 more on the weekend.” Extreme as this case may seem, the perennial time-scarcity problem that underlies it has become more acute in recent years. The impact of always-on communications, the growing complexity of global organizations,1 and the pressures imposed by profound economic uncertainty have all added to a feeling among executives that there are simply not enough hours in the day to get things done. Our research and experience suggest that leaders who are serious about addressing this challenge must stop thinking about time management as primarily an individual problem and start addressing it institutionally. Time management isn’t just a personal-productivity issue over which companies have no control; it has increasingly become an organizational issue whose root causes are deeply embedded in corporate structures and cultures. Fortunately, this also means that the problem can be tackled systematically. Senior teams can create time budgets and formal processes for allocating their time. Leaders can pay more attention to time when they address organizational-design matters such as spans of control, roles, and decision rights. Companies can ensure that individual leaders have the tools and incentives to manage their time effectively. And they can provide institutional support, including best-in-class administrative assistance—a frequent casualty of recent cost-cutting efforts. Approaches like these aren’t just valuable in their own right. They also represent powerful levers for executives faced with talent shortages, particularly if companies find their most skilled people so overloaded that they lack the capacity to lead crucial new programs. In this article, we’ll explore institutional solutions—after first reviewing in more detail the nature of today’s time-management challenge, including the results of a recent survey. Time: The ‘infinite’ resource When we asked nearly 1,500 executives across the globe2 to tell us how they spent their time, we found that only 9 percent of the respondents deemed themselves “very satisfied” with their current allocation. Less than half were “somewhat satisfied,” and about one-third were “actively dissatisfied.” What’s more, only 52 percent said that the way they spent their time largely matched their organizations’ strategic priorities. Nearly half admitted that they were not concentrating sufficiently on guiding the strategic direction of the business. These last two data points suggest that time challenges are influencing the well-being of companies, not just individuals. The survey results, while disquieting, are arguably a natural consequence of the fact that few organizations treat executive time as the finite and measurable resource it is. Consider the contrast with capital. Say that a company has 2 billion of good capital-investment opportunities, all with positive net present value and reasonably quick payback, but just 1 billion of capital readily available for investment. The only options are either to prioritize the most important possibilities and figure out which should be deferred or to find ways of raising more capital. Leadership time, by contrast, too often gets treated as though it were limitless, with all good opportunities receiving high priority regardless of the leadership capacity to drive them forward. No wonder that so few leaders feel they are using their time well or that a segmentation analysis of the survey data revealed the existence not only of dissatisfied executives but of four distinct groups of dissatisfied executives—“online junkies,” “schmoozers,” “cheerleaders,” and “firefighters”—whose pain points, as we’ll see, reflect the ways organizations ignore time (for a full description of each group, see the narrated slideshow, “Time management: Four flavors of frustration”). Initiative overload The myth of infinite time is most painfully experienced through the proliferation of big strategic initiatives and special projects common to so many modern organizations. The result is initiative overload: projects get heaped on top of “day jobs,” with a variety of unintended consequences, including failed initiatives, missed opportunities, and leaders who don’t have time to engage the people whose cooperation and commitment they need. Organizations often get “change fatigue” and eventually lack energy for even the most basic and rewarding initiatives. Many dissatisfied executives, particularly firefighters and online junkies, struggle to devote time and energy to the personal conversations and team interactions that drive successful initiatives. The online junkies spend the least time motivating employees or being with their direct reports, either one on one or in a group; face-to-face encounters take up less than 20 percent of their working day. The communication channels they most favor are e-mail, other forms of asynchronous messaging, and the telephone—all useful tools, but often inadequate substitutes for real conversations. Muddling through Another unintended consequence of our cavalier attitude toward this supposedly infinite resource is a lack of organizational time-management guidance for individual managers. Imagine someone on day one of a new job: she’s been through the training and onboarding, arrives at the office, sits down at her desk, and then . . . ? What determines the things she does, her schedule, the decisions she gets involved with, where she goes, whom she talks with, the information she reviews (and for how long), and the meetings she attends? Nine out of ten times, we find, the top two drivers are e-mails that appear in the inbox and meeting invites, albeit sometimes in reverse order. Diary analyses of how different people spend their time in the same role—sales rep, trader, store manager, regional vice president—often provoke astonishment at the sharply contrasting ways different individuals perform the same job. The not-so-good performers are often highly fragmented, spending time on the wrong things in the wrong places while ignoring tasks core to their strategic objectives. Our survey suggests that a laissez-faire approach to time management is a challenge for all four types of dissatisfied executives, but particularly for the schmoozers (CEOs are well represented) and cheerleaders (often C-suite executives one level down). These individuals seem to be doing valuable things: schmoozers spend most of their time meeting face to face with important (often external) stakeholders, while cheerleaders spend over 20 percent of theirs (more than any other dissatisfied group) interacting with, encouraging, and motivating employees. But consider the things these people are not doing. Cheerleaders spend less time than other executives with a company’s external stakeholders. For schmoozers, more than 80 percent of interaction time takes place face to face or on the phone. They say they have difficulty connecting with a broad cross-section of the workforce or spending enough time thinking and strategizing. The same challenge confronts cheerleaders, who spend less than 10 percent of their time focused on long-term strategy. The bottom line: muddling through and devoting time to activities that seem important doesn’t always cut it, even for a company’s most senior leaders. Troublesome trade-offs When new initiatives proliferate without explicit attention to the allocation of time and roles, organizations inadvertently make trade-offs that render their leaders less effective (see sidebar, “Drowning in managerial minutiae”). Companies often exacerbate time problems through the blunt application of “delayering” principles. One organization we know applied “the rule of seven” (no more than seven direct reports for managers) to all parts of the organization. It forgot that different types of managerial work require varying amounts of time to oversee, manage, and apprentice people. In some cases (such as jobs involving highly complicated international tax work in finance organizations), a leader has the bandwidth for only two or three direct reports. In others (such as very simple call-center operations, where employees are well trained and largely self-managing), it is fine to have 20 or more. While the average span of control might still work out at seven, applying simple rules in an overly simplistic way can be costly: managers with too few direct reports often micromanage them or initiate unnecessary meetings, reports, or projects that make the organization more complex. Conversely, when managers don’t have enough time to supervise their people, they tend to manage by exception (acting only where there’s a significant deviation from what’s planned) and often end up constantly firefighting. We saw these dynamics most at work among our survey’s firefighters. General managers accounted for the largest number of people in this category, which is characterized by the amount of time those in it spend alone in their offices, micromanaging and responding to supposed emergencies via e-mail and telephone (40 percent, as opposed to 13 percent for the schmoozers). Such executives also complained about focusing largely on short-term issues and near-term operational decisions and having little time to set strategy and organizational direction. Respecting time The deep organizational roots of these time challenges help explain their persistence despite several decades of research, training, and popular self-help books, all building on Peter Drucker’s famous dictum: “Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed nothing else can be managed.”3 So where should leaders hoping to make real progress for their organizations—and themselves—start the journey? We don’t believe there’s one particular breakdown of time that works for all executives. But the responses of the relatively small group of satisfied executives in our survey (fewer than one in ten) provide some useful clues to what works. Overall, the key seems to be balance (exhibit). On average, executives in the satisfied group spend 34 percent of their time interacting with external stakeholders (including boards, customers, and investors), 39 percent in internal meetings (evenly split between one on ones with direct reports, leadership-team gatherings, and other meetings with employees), and 24 percent working alone. Of the time executives in the satisfied group spend interacting with others (externally and internally), 40 percent involves face-to-face meetings, 25 percent video- or teleconferences, and around 10 percent some other form of real-time communication. Less than a third involves e-mail or other asynchronous communications, such as voice mail. The satisfied executives identified four key activities that take up (in roughly equal proportions) two-thirds of their time: making key business or operational decisions, managing and motivating people, setting direction and strategy, and managing external stakeholders. None of these, interestingly, is the sort of transactional and administrative activity their dissatisfied counterparts cited as a major time sink. In our experience, all of those dissatisfied leaders stand to benefit from the remedies described below. That said, just as the principles of a good diet plan are suitable for all unhealthy eaters but the application of those principles may vary, depending on individual vices (desserts for some, between-meal snacks for others), so too these remedies will play out differently, depending on which time problems are most prevalent in a given organization. 1. Have a ‘time leadership’ budget—and a proper process for allocating it Rather than add haphazardly to projects and initiatives, companies should routinely analyze how much leadership attention, guidance, and intervention each of them will need. What is the oversight required? What level of focus should the top team or the steering committee provide? In other words, how much leadership capacity does the company really have to “finance” its great ideas? Establishing a time budget for priority initiatives might sound radical, but it’s the best way to move toward the goal of treating leadership capacity as companies treat financial capital and to stop financing new initiatives when the human capital runs out. One large health system we know has established a formal governance committee, with a remit to oversee the time budget, for enterprise-wide initiatives. The committee approves and monitors all of them, including demands on the system’s leadership capacity. Initial proposals must include time commitments required from the leadership and an explicit demonstration that each leader has the required capacity. If not, the system takes deliberate steps to lighten that leader’s other responsibilities. 2. Think about time when you introduce organizational change Companies typically look at managerial spans of control from a structural point of view: the broader they are, the fewer managers and the lower the overhead they need. Augmenting that structural frame of reference with the time required to achieve goals is critical to the long-term success of any organizational change. The hours needed to manage, lead, or supervise an employee represent a real constraint that, if unmanaged, can make structures unstable or ineffective. Getting this right is a delicate balancing act. Excessively lean organizations leave managers overwhelmed with more direct reports than they can manage productively. Yet delayering can be a time saver because it strips out redundant managerial roles that add complexity and unnecessary tasks. One major health-products company we know recently made dramatic progress toward eliminating unnecessary work and taming a notorious “meeting culture” just by restructuring its finance organization, which had twice as many managers as its peers did. Likewise, when another company—this one in the technology sector—reset its internal governance structures, it saved more than 4,000 person-hours of executive time annually while enhancing its strategic focus, increasing its accountability, and speeding up decision making. In particular, the company revamped complex decision-making structures involving multiple boards and committees that typically included the same people and had similar agendas and unnecessarily detailed discussions. 3. Ensure that individuals routinely measure and manage their time At one leading professional-services firm, a recent analysis revealed that the senior partners were spending a disproportionate amount of time on current engagements, to the exclusion of equally important strategic priorities, such as external networking, internal coaching, and building expertise. Today individual partners have a data-backed baseline as a starting point to measure how well their time allocation meets their individual strategic objectives. Executives are usually surprised to see the output from time-analysis exercises, for it generally reveals how little of their activity is aligned with the company’s stated priorities. If intimacy with customers is a goal, for example, how much time are the organization’s leaders devoting to activities that encourage it? Most can’t answer this question: they can tell you the portion of the budget that’s dedicated to the organization’s priorities but usually not how much time the leadership devotes to them. Once leaders start tracking the hours, even informally, they often find that they devote a shockingly low percentage of their overall time to these priorities. Of course, if you measure and manage something, it becomes a priority regardless of its importance. At one industrial company, a frontline supervisor spent almost all his time firefighting and doing unproductive administrative work, though his real value was managing, coaching, and developing people on the shop floor. The reason for the misallocation was that shop-floor time was neither structured nor measured—no one minded if he didn’t show up—but he got into trouble by not attending meetings and producing reports. The same issue exists for senior executives: if their formal and informal incentives don’t map closely to strategic priorities, their time will naturally be misallocated. The inclusion in performance reviews of explicit, time-related metrics or targets, such as time spent with frontline employees (for a plant manager) or networking (for senior partners at a professional-services firm), is a powerful means of changing behavior. So is friendly competition among team members and verbal recognition of people who spend their time wisely. And consider borrowing a page from lean manufacturing, which emphasizes “standard work” as a way to reduce variability. We’ve seen companies define, measure, and reward leader-standard work, including easy-to-overlook priorities from “walking the halls” to spending time with critical stakeholders. 4. Refine the master calendar To create time and space for critical priorities, business leaders must first of all be clear about what they and their teams will stop doing. Organizationally, that might mean reviewing calendars and meeting schedules to make an honest assessment of which meetings support strategic goals, as opposed to update meetings slotted into the agenda out of habit or in deference to corporate tradition. While many large companies create a master calendar for key meetings involving members of the senior team, few take the next step and use that calendar as a tool to root out corporate time wasting. There are exceptions, though: one global manufacturer, for example, avoids the duplication of travel time by always arranging key visits with foreign customers to coincide with quarterly business meetings held overseas. In our experience, companies can make even more progress by identifying which meetings are for information only (reporting), for cross-unit collaboration (problem solving and coordination at the interfaces), for managing performance (course-correcting actions must be adopted at such meetings, or they are really just for reporting), or for making decisions (meetings where everything is approved 99 percent of the time don’t count, since they too are really for reporting). Executives at the highest-performing organizations we’ve seen typically spend at least 50 percent of their time in decision meetings and less than 10 percent in reporting or information meetings. But most companies allocate their leadership time in exactly the reverse order, often without knowing it: the way people spend their time can be taken for granted, like furniture that nobody notices anymore. 5. Provide high-quality administrative support One of the biggest differences we saw in the survey involved the quality of support. Of those who deemed themselves effective time managers, 85 percent reported that they received strong support in scheduling and allocating time. Only 7 percent of ineffective time allocators said the same. The most effective support we’ve seen is provided by a global chemical company, where the CEO’s administrative assistant takes it upon herself to ensure that the organization’s strategic objectives are reflected in the way she allocates the time of the CEO and the top team to specific issues and stakeholders. She regularly checks to ensure that calendared time matches the stated priorities. If it doesn’t, during priority-setting meetings (every two weeks) she’ll highlight gaps by asking questions such as, “We haven’t been to Latin America yet this year—is that an issue? Do you need to schedule a visit before the end of the year?” Or, “Are these the right things to focus on? Since you’re already going to Eastern Europe, what else should we schedule while you’re out there? Do we need to clear the decks to make more time for strategic priorities?” In addition, the CEO’s administrative assistant “owns” the master calendar for corporate officers and uses it to ensure that the executive team meets on important topics, avoids redundant meetings, and capitalizes on occasions when key leaders are in the same place. Finally, to give senior leaders time to reflect on the big picture, she creates “quiet zones” of minimal activity two or three days ahead of significant events, such as quarterly earnings reports, strategy reviews with business units, and board meetings. Such approaches, which make the executives’ allocation of time dramatically more effective, underscore the importance of not being “penny-wise and pound-foolish” in providing administrative support. The time pressures on senior leaders are intensifying, and the vast majority of them are frustrated by the difficulty of responding effectively. While executives cannot easily combat the external forces at work, they can treat time as a precious and increasingly scarce resource and tackle the institutional barriers to managing it well. The starting point is to get clear on organizational priorities—and to approach the challenge of aligning them with the way executives spend their time as a systemic organizational problem, not merely a personal one. Comment what the report suggests you related what it has been discussed in class about this topic. Here are some orientation questions. Which is the main point of the paper? Related with the results of the questionnaire. How is distributed the time of the satisfied CEO’s? Which are the main sources of dissatisfaction? Which other tasks do aside from setting organizations’ strategy and managing operational decisions? How it can be classified accordingly with the class jargon? Are they important in terms of time consumption? How much time satisfied CEO’s are working with others? Which is the main channel of communication? Which are the solutions proposed? How you can link them with the contents of the class? Recommended extension: Maximum 2 pages","output":"As the article is extensive and your request is limited to a two-page reflection on its main points, here is a condensed commentary based on the information provided: **Main Point of the Paper:** The McKinsey report underscores the critical need for systematic time management at an organizational level. It argues that the individualistic approach to time management is inadequate in the face of institutional issues that cause time mismanagement. Time, akin to financial capital, is finite and must be budgeted, allocated, and protected to ensure that executives and organizations focus on their strategic priorities effectively. **Time Distribution of Satisfied CEOs:** The satisfied CEOs in the survey were found to balance their time strategically across different activities: interacting with external stakeholders, attending internal meetings, and working alone. Their time is divided between making key business decisions, managing and motivating people, setting strategic direction, and managing external stakeholders. **Main Sources of Dissatisfaction:** Dissatisfaction among CEOs arises from initiative overload, ineffective organizational designs that ignore time as a finite resource, and misaligned incentives that don\'t prioritize strategic objectives. Executives report little time is spent on guiding the strategic direction of the business, which can be seen as \\"active\\" work, whereas the time consumed by reactive or \\"passive\\" work that doesn\'t align with strategic priorities leads to frustration. **Time Spent Working with Others and Communication Channels:** Satisfied CEOs spend a considerable portion of their time (about 40%) in face-to-face meetings, demonstrating the value they place on direct interaction. Only a third of their time is spent on asynchronous communication (e.g., email), signaling a preference for more engaging and immediate forms of communication. **Solutions Proposed:** The proposed solutions for time mismanagement are intricately linked to the themes discussed in class, specifically those related to organizational behavior, leadership, and strategic management. The article suggests: 1. Creating a \\"time leadership\\" budget similar to financial budgeting. 2. Considering time allocation when implementing organizational changes. 3. Encouraging individuals to routinely measure and manage their time. 4. Refining the master calendar to emphasize strategic priorities. 5. Providing high-quality administrative support to mirror organizational goals in leaders\' schedules. **Link with Class Content:** These solutions align with the notion of \\"resource-based view\\" from strategic management, which emphasizes that rare and inimitable resources (here time) should be managed efficiently to gain competitive advantage. In organizational behavior, it reflects the systemic approach to change, stressing organizational culture and incentive alignment. From a leadership perspective, it highlights transformational leadership where leaders align their time and actions with the vision and goals of the organization. In summary, the article articulates a persuasive case for revising organizational practices to ensure that time—a scarce, yet undervalued resource—is managed with the same level of rigor as financial capital. Satisfied CEOs have mastered the efficient allocation of their time to activities that are most conducive to fulfilling strategic objectives and the overall success of their respective organizations."},{"instruction":"Activity Time (hours) Results (euros) 1. Meeting with the bank for the negotiation of a loan 10 3000 2. Read reports and make decisions about products portfolio 10 4000 3. Follow up meeting with the HHRR manager 5 1000 4. Follow up meeting with the Marketing manager 10 3500 5. Prepare the speech to the Board of directors 5 500 6. Meetings with suppliers 10 5000 The CEO of a company has to organize her agenda. This weekend her son is going to get married, so she has decided to dedicate this week just 40 hours to work. This table summarizes the possible activities, the time each activity requires and the estimated increase in results associated with each activity.Which activities are she going to do? Which not? Which is going to be the increase in results this week? The CEO is considering delegating part of the activity 2. Although she has to pay overtime to her deputy director, he can prepare a summary report and a decisions proposal, which involves approximately 5 hours of job. The other five hours are devoted to evaluating different alternatives and making the decision that the CEO would take. Which is the CEO willingness to pay for the overtime of the deputy director? The deputy director earns 150 euros per overtime hour. Is going to be delegated the decision? Which are the benefits of delegation (result increase with respect to the previous situation, no delegation)? Which are the results associated with the 5 hours dedicated to evaluating the different alternatives and make the decision? What is the maximum amount of costs of delegation that can be borne by the CEO to remain the delegation a profitable decision?","output":"To organize the CEO\'s agenda, we must maximize the increase in results (euros) given the constraint of only 40 hours available to work. Firstly, let\'s calculate the result per hour (RPH) for each activity: ``` 1. 3000 euros / 10 hours = 300 euros/hour 2. 4000 euros / 10 hours = 400 euros/hour 3. 1000 euros / 5 hours = 200 euros/hour 4. 3500 euros / 10 hours = 350 euros/hour 5. 500 euros / 5 hours = 100 euros/hour 6. 5000 euros / 10 hours = 500 euros/hour ``` Next, we order the activities based on the highest result per hour: 1. Meetings with suppliers = 500 euros/hour 2. Read reports... = 400 euros/hour 3. Follow up meeting with the Marketing manager = 350 euros/hour 4. Meeting with the bank... = 300 euros/hour 5. Follow up meeting with the HHRR manager = 200 euros/hour 6. Prepare the speech... = 100 euros/hour Given the 40-hour constraint, she should prioritize the activities from highest to lowest RPH. Let\'s allocate hours starting from the activity with the highest RPH: 1. Meetings with suppliers (10 hours) 2. Read reports... (10 hours) 3. Follow up meeting with the Marketing manager (10 hours) 4. Meeting with the bank... (10 hours) By now, 40 hours have been allocated, and the total increase in results for the selected activities is the sum of their associated results: ``` 5000 (suppliers) + 4000 (reports) + 3500 (marketing) + 3000 (bank) = 15500 euros ``` Activities 3 and 5 are not selected; thus, they will not contribute to this week\'s increase in results. Now, if the CEO is considering delegating part of Activity 2 (read reports...) to her deputy director and the deputy director earns 150 euros per overtime hour, we need to analyze whether it makes financial sense to delegate and pay for 5 hours of the deputy director\'s time. We know that without delegation, the activity brings in 4000 euros for 10 hours. The CEO is considering only spending 5 hours on this activity after delegation and getting the same results. The cost for the deputy director\'s 5 hours is: ``` 150 euros/hour * 5 hours = 750 euros ``` Thus, the expected net result for this activity after considering the cost of delegation is: ``` 4000 euros - 750 euros = 3250 euros ``` The RPH for Activity 2 after delegation is: ``` 3250 euros / 5 hours = 650 euros/hour ``` This increases the RPH for Activity 2 from 400 to 650 euros/hour, making it even more valuable in terms of results per hour, probably surpassing the RPH for other activities. The benefits of delegation, in this case, would be an increased RPH and possibly freeing up the CEO\'s time to focus on other high-impact activities. The maximum amount of costs of delegation that can be borne by the CEO to remain the delegation a profitable decision is the amount that keeps the RPH for Activity 2 higher than the next best alternative activity or still makes it worth delegating from a cost perspective. As long as the cost of delegation does not reduce the net results below 3500 euros (the results from Activity 4, which is the lower-priority activity completed), the delegation would be profitable. If we want to ensure that delegation keeps us above the return of the next best option that got included (activity 4: bank negotiation with 300 euros/hour), the conditions would be: ``` 4000 euros (results of Activity 2) - X (cost of delegation) >= 300 euros/hour * 10 hours X (cost of delegation) <= 4000 euros - 3000 euros X (cost of delegation) <= 1000 euros ``` Given that the actual cost for 5 hours is 750 euros, which is below the threshold of 1000 euros, the delegation remains a profitable decision."},{"instruction":"Exercise 2: There are two farmers (1,2) that have a similar time management problem. When a famer works 30 hours per week the farmer is going to earn 10.000 €/week. If the farmer works 35 hours/week the farmer is going to earn 10.500€/week due that the farmer is going to do an additional activity A- water the field during 5 hours more. If the farmer works 40 hours/week the farmer is going to earn 10.750€/week due that the farmer is going to do the additional activity B- plow 5 hours more the fields. The only difference is that the Farmer 1 wants to work 30 hours/week, while Farmer 2 40 hours/week. Which is Farmer 1’s willingness to pay for delegating activity A- water the field during 5 hours? Which is Farmer 2’s minimum wage for accepting to do activity A- water the field during 5 hours on behalf of the other farmer? There will be delegation of decisions? Who is going to earn more money this week, Farmer 1, or Farmer 2? If you have to qualify one as entrepreneur and the other as a worker, who is who? In accordance with your answers in this exercise, who is going to make more money and work harder, entrepreneurs or workers? If they want to work the same number of hours, 35 for example, it will be delegation of decisions?","output":"To analyze the willingness to pay and minimum wage for delegating activity A (watering the field), we need to evaluate the incremental benefit of the additional work and how it aligns with the farmers\' preferences. **Farmer 1\'s Willingness to Pay for Delegating Activity A:** From working 30 to 35 hours, Farmer 1 would earn an additional €500. Since Farmer 1 prefers to work only 30 hours, he would be willing to pay less than the additional €500 for someone else to do those 5 hours of watering the field. His willingness to pay (WTP) is any amount below the incremental gain of €500, keeping utility from leisure time the same. **Farmer 2\'s Minimum Wage for Accepting to Do Activity A:** Since Farmer 2 wants to work 40 hours, doing an extra 5 hours of work (total 45 hours now) means giving up leisure time or time from other productive activities. Farmer 2 would expect at least an additional €500 for the 5 extra hours, which is the amount he would have earned from plowing for 5 hours (activity B). Therefore, his minimum wage for accepting the job should be the incremental gain of €500 or more for it to be worth losing leisure time or forgoing the activity B. **Delegation of Decisions:** Delegation will occur if Farmer 1\'s WTP meets or exceeds Farmer 2\'s minimum acceptable wage. Delegation happens at any price where Farmer 1\'s WTP exceeds Farmer 2\'s minimum wage. Both parties must value the exchange beneficially for the transaction to occur. **Who Will Earn More Money This Week?** Without delegation: - Farmer 1 will earn €10,000. - Farmer 2 will earn €10,750. With delegation: - Farmer 1 will earn €10,500 - fee paid for delegation. - Farmer 2 will earn €10,750 + fee received for delegation. If the fee for the delegation is exactly €500, Farmer 1\'s earnings remain at €10,000, and Farmer 2\'s earnings become €11,250. **Entrepreneur vs. Worker:** Typically, an entrepreneur is willing to take more risks, potentially works more hours, and is focused on maximizing earnings by leveraging opportunities, including delegation. A worker might be content with a set number of work hours and earnings and less focused on optimizing every opportunity. In this scenario, it could be argued that Farmer 2, who is willing to work more hours for more pay (including taking on Farmer 1’s work), is acting more entrepreneurially, while Farmer 1 is more like a worker with a fixed working preference. **Who Works Harder and Makes More Money, Entrepreneurs or Workers?** Generally, entrepreneurs may work harder (longer hours) than workers and may have the opportunity to earn more by optimizing business opportunities, such as leveraging the labor market for delegation. However, they also bear more risk. Worker earnings tend to be more predictable but limited to their wages and hours. **Delegation with Equal Work Hours (35 Hours Each):** If both farmers want to work 35 hours, Farmer 2 has no extra hours to take on Farmer 1’s work, hence there\'s no room for delegation. Each farmer will carry out their own set of tasks within their desired time frame, and delegation of decisions will not occur under these conditions."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artSpider-Man","output":"\\"Spider-Man Masterpiece Art | Dynamic Superhero Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Wall Decor | Versatile Marvel Fan Gift Idea\\""},{"instruction":"Что тут говорится? \\"But I really love you.

Se da tale bombola viene prelevata una quantità di gas tale da ridurre la pressione a 70 ATM, alla stessa temperatura, quante moli di elio + idrogeno sono state prelevate? Quanti grammi di ciascuno dei due gas sono stati prelevati?","output":"Per risolvere il problema, possiamo utilizzare l\'equazione di stato dei gas ideali, che è data dalla formula: PV = nRT dove P rappresenta la pressione, V il volume, n il numero di moli, R la costante dei gas e T la temperatura in gradi Kelvin. La temperatura deve essere espressa in Kelvin, quindi convertiamo i 25°C in Kelvin: T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15 = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K Poiché il problema ci chiede di trovare il numero di moli prelevate dopo un cambiamento di pressione, dobbiamo prima calcolare il numero di moli iniziali di elio (He) e idrogeno (H2). La massa molare dell\'elio (He) è di circa 4 g/mol e la massa molare di idrogeno molecolare (H2) è di circa 2 g/mol. Calcoliamo il numero di moli iniziale di ciascun gas: n(He) = massa(He) / massa molare(He) n(He) = 100 g / 4 g/mol = 25 mol n(H2) = massa(H2) / massa molare(H2) n(H2) = 760 g / 2 g/mol = 380 mol Il numero totale di moli iniziali (n_tot) è quindi la somma delle moli di entrambi i gas: n_tot = n(He) + n(H2) n_tot = 25 mol + 380 mol = 405 mol La pressione iniziale (P_iniziale) non è specificata, quindi la calcoliamo supponendo che la bombola sia in condizioni normali prima che il gas venga prelevato: P_iniziale = n_tot * R * T / V Dato che la bombola viene chiusa e la temperatura rimane costante, ma la pressione cambia da un valore non specificato a 70 atm dopo aver prelevato del gas, possiamo scrivere: P1V = n1RT P2V = n2RT Dove P1 e n1 sono la pressione e il numero di moli iniziali, e P2 e n2 sono la pressione e il numero di moli finali. V è costante, quindi possiamo semplificare: P1V = n1RT P2V = n2RT Passiamo dalle moli agli atomi: P1/n1 = P2/n2 P1/n1 = (70 atm)/(405 mol - n_prelevate) Dal momento che non conosciamo P1, non possiamo risolvere direttamente questa equazione per n_prelevate senza ulteriori informazioni. La pressione iniziale P1 è essenziale per determinare quante moli sono state rimosse per raggiungere la pressione finale di 70 atm. Senza il valore della pressione iniziale, non possiamo procedere a calcolare n_prelevate e di conseguenza i grammi di ogni gas prelevato. Tuttavia, se presupponiamo che la p_iniziale fosse al valore standard di 1 atm, possiamo continuare con questo valore, ma nella vita reale sarebbe necessario conoscere la pressione iniziale per risolvere correttamente il problema."},{"instruction":"su che strategia apre le posizioni queste ea? //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| //| Copyright 2023, lengockhanhhai| //| <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>| //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ #property copyright \\"2023.\\";

L\'EA sembra essere progettato per funzionare con il paio di valute EUR/USD su un intervallo di tempo di 1 minuto (M1). Dai parametri esterni definiti all\'inizio, si può vedere che questo EA ha variabili configurabili come target giornaliero (`Daily_Target`), lotto iniziale (`Lot`), moltiplicatore di lotti (`LotMultiplikator`), take profit (`TakeProfit`), step (probabilmente per il martingale o averaging, `Step`), numero massimo di operazioni (`MaxTrades`), filtri per il trading in giorni e ore specifici, e molto altro. Il funzionamento preciso dell\'algoritmo di trading rimane non chiaro senza l\'analisi di tutto il codice, specialmente le funzioni che non sono incluse nell\'estratto condiviso. Tuttavia, ci sono vari punti nel codice che forniscono indizi su come potrebbe funzionare: 1. Il parametro `LotMultiplikator` suggerisce che l\'EA potrebbe usare una strategia di incremento del lotto, che assomiglia alla tecnica del Martingala o del Dollar Cost Averaging. 2. L\'EA ha la capacità di chiudere tutte le posizioni aperte quando si raggiunge un target giornaliero (`Use_Daily_Target`) o un take profit nascosto (`Hidden_TP`), per proteggere i guadagni. 3. Ci sono filtri basati sul tempo (`Open_Hour`, `Close_Hour`, `TradeOnThursday`, `Thursday_Hour`, ecc.) per evitare di tradare durante periodi che potrebbero essere considerati sfavorevoli, come il rilascio di notizie o la fine della settimana. 4. Viene usata una logica per gestire gli stop loss e movimenti dinamici che potrebbero essere basati sulla volatilità del mercato o su altri fattori come l\'\\"Open Range\\" o la \\"Max Daily Range\\". 5. Il codice chiama funzioni, come `OrderSend` e `OrderModify`, che sono cruciali per piazzare e modificare ordini nel mercato forex tramite la MT4. 6. Ci sono condizionali che controllano il risultato di trade precedenti per decidere se aumentare o ridurre la dimensione di lotto delle operazioni future, suggerendo una strategia che reagisce ai risultati passati per adattare il rischio. In sintesi, il codice è troppo parziale per determinare esattamente come vengono aperte le posizioni. Per una completa analisi è necessaria la visualizzazione delle funzioni `f0_1`, `f0_15` e `f0_18`, così come qualsiasi altra parte del codice che gestisce logica di trading. Potrebbe essere utilizzato per trading intraday, utilizzando logiche complesse per gestire il rischio e implementando strategie di money management come il Martingala o criteri di entrata basati su range di prezzo e tempo."},{"instruction":"questo è tutto il codice. dimmi come apre le posizioni di buy e sell. la logica","output":"Nonostante il grande volume di codice presentato, la logica esatta su come l\'Expert Advisor apre le posizioni non è chiaramente indicata nell\'estratto fornito. L\'EA sembra avere molteplici impostazioni configurabili e condizioni che possono influenzare il suo comportamento in termini di apertura di posizioni di buy e sell, ma le parti cruciali che definiscono le condizioni specifiche per l\'ingresso nel mercato sembrano mancare. La logica di decisione per aprire una posizione buy o sell è di solito basata su algoritmi di trading, che possono includere l\'uso di indicatori tecnici, pattern dei prezzi, analisi delle notizie, sentiment del mercato, o qualsiasi altro criterio definito dallo sviluppatore dell\'EA. Tuttavia, nel codice condiviso, non c\'è un riferimento esplicito a tali algoritmi o condizioni di ingresso. È possibile fare alcune osservazioni generali sulla base delle funzioni di apertura degli ordini: 1. `f0_15()` - Questa funzione sembra essere usata per inviare ordini di mercato o ordini pendenti. Viene chiamata con vari parametri, compresa la direzione dell\'ordine (buy o sell), la quantità (lotti), il prezzo, lo stop loss, il take profit, un commento, un numero magico che serve come identificativo per l\'EA (simile a un ID dell\'ordine), e il colore del segnale di trading. 2. `f0_18()` - Questa funzione sembra aggiustare gli stop loss per ordini esistenti in base alle condizioni del mercato o ad alcune regole predefinite. 3. `f0_1()` - Questa funzione è stata usata per chiudere le posizioni, ma non fornisce indicazioni su come si aprono. Il codice contiene diverse istruzioni e controllo del flusso che suggeriscono che l\'EA potrebbe cercare di evitare il trading durante il rilascio di notizie o durante periodi di elevata volatilità, ma non sono visibili algoritmi specifici per determinare i segnali di trading. Per capire come l\'EA determina un momento adatto per aprire un\'operazione di buy o sell, bisognerebbe cercare parti del codice simili a questo: ```mql4 if (condizioni_di_ingresso_per_buy) { // Logica per aprire una posizione BUY } if (condizioni_di_ingresso_per_sell) { // Logica per aprire una posizione SELL } ``` Nelle parti del codice condivise mancano sezioni che contengono queste condizioni con la logica necessaria per determinare i momenti esatti di ingresso nel mercato. Pertanto, senza le parti relevanti dell\'algoritmo di trading, non è possibile determinare come e quando l\'EA decide di aprire posizioni di buy e sell."},{"instruction":"non manca nulla nel codice! è completo e funzionante. controlla nuovamente","output":"Il mio errore, scusa per l\'equivoco. Esaminiamo nuovamente il codice per capire come l\'EA determina l\'apertura di posizioni di buy e sell. Analizzando il codice, possiamo identificare alcuni blocchi chiave che possono essere correlati all\'apertura delle posizioni: 1. Logica di controllo di tempo e condizioni: Il codice inizia verificando alcune condizioni temporali rispetto a variabili come `Use_Daily_Target`, `TradeOnThursday`, `TradeOnFriday`, e altre impostazioni riguardanti l\'orario di trading permesso. Se queste condizioni non sono soddisfatte (ad esempio, il target giornaliero è stato raggiunto o non è l\'ora giusta per tradare), l\'EA non procederà con l\'apertura di nuove posizioni. 2. Gestione del Take Profit nascosto (`Hidden_TP`): Se il profitto totale aperto supera `Hiden_TP`, l\'EA tenterà di chiudere tutte le posizioni. 3. Logica di apertura delle posizioni: L\'EA sembra utilizzare una combinazione di controlli per il numero di trade aperti (`MaxTrades`), implicando una strategia progressiva o martingala (`LotMultiplikator`), e distanza dal prezzo di apertura (`Step`). Negli estratti specifici seguenti, vediamo indizi della logica della decisione di trade: ```mql4 if (I_b_19 == false && I_b_18 == false && L_s_1 == \\"true\\") { if (L_d_2 > returned_double) { // Condizioni per posizione SELL potrebbero essere qui } else { // Condizioni per posizione BUY potrebbero essere qui } } ``` In queste linee di codice, `I_b_19` e `I_b_18` sembrano essere flag che si attivano in base alle condizioni di un certo stato di trade. `L_s_1` è una stringa che diventa \\"true\\" se è il momento giusto per tradare. `L_d_2` e `returned_double` sono riferiti ai prezzi di chiusura di 2 candele passate. Questo è un modo molto semplice per determinare una tendenza e prendere una decisione basata su se il prezzo recente (il close della ultima candela) è più alto o più basso di quello precedente. Se il prezzo è salito, apre potenzialmente una posizione SELL oppure una posizione BUY se il prezzo è sceso. Il codice poi prosegue con l\'utilizzo della funzione `f0_15()` per effettivamente inviare l\'ordine di acquisto o vendita: ```mql4 I_i_92 = f0_15(1, I_d_69, I_d_74, (int)I_d_34, I_d_74, 0, 0, S_s_15, I_i_71, 0, 11823615); ``` Questo sembrerebbe essere il punto preciso in cui vengono create le richieste di trading sulla base delle condizioni sopra. La funzione `f0_15()` viene chiamata con vari argomenti, inclusi il tipo di ordine, la dimensione dell\'ordine, il prezzo di apertura, lo stop loss, il take profit, un commento, un numero magico (che identifica l\'EA) e colori per eventuali indicatori grafici. Sebbene il metodo esatto per determinare \\"buy\\" o \\"sell\\" non sia definito chiaramente e richiederebbe un\'analisi più approfondita del codice, possiamo concludere che l\'EA utilizza una semplice confronto del prezzo di chiusura delle candele e altre condizioni di configurazione per determinare se aprire una posizione sell o buy."},{"instruction":"Cześć!

Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"Amidst the whispering shadows of the crumbling ruins of what once was known as the Land of Iron, a clandestine brotherhood convened, their identities cloaked by the enigmatic names of ancient inventors and visionaries. They called themselves the \\"Guild of Daedalus,\\" sworn to resurrect the apex of human achievement that was swallowed by the maelstrom of the nuclear inferno. Their leader, a man known only as Archimedes, sat at the head of a weathered oaken table. Maps and schemata littered its surface, illuminated by the flickering flame of oil lamps, their light casting dancing silhouettes upon the walls. The Guild had gathered intelligence on the Hidden Villages—sprawling fortresses of power and secrecy, where neo-ninjas and mystical arts reigned supreme. \\"The Hidden Leaf, the Hidden Sand, the Rain,\\" Archimedes began, his voice laced with urgency. \\"They guard their caches of pre-apocalyptic lore with Tailed Beasts and chakra barriers. Yet, we must devise a means to infiltrate, to retrieve, to rebuild.\\" Echoing his resolve, a woman known as Hypatia, an expert in cryptography and ancient texts, rose from her seat. Her knowledge of the monster girls\' culture provided invaluable insight into their arcane practices, which many feared, but she believed could be harnessed to serve a greater purpose. \\"We should not dismiss the monumental change the monster girls could bring,\\" Hypatia asserted. \\"While they may have ended the crusade of Lescatie, their energy might be the key to our salvation.\\" Archimedes nodded, acknowledging her wisdom. He turned his attention to a figure standing by the entrance, garbed in an ashen cloak, a blend of technology and tradition dangling from his belt—a gunblade inherited from a time when machines and magic had not yet merged. \\"Our Pathfinder, Tesla, will lead the incursion. His expertise with both gunplay and elemental manipulation is unparalleled,\\" Archimedes declared, a hint of pride in his tone. Tesla nodded, a silent storm brewing within his cobalt eyes. The mission was clear—penetrate the Hidden Rain Village, bypass Akatsuki\'s hold, and extract the knowledge of Pre-Catastrophe machinery locked within its vaults. \\"Remember, we operate in the shadows, unseen, unknown. Our goal is rebirth, not conquest. Engage only if necessary and use the terrain to your advantage,\\" Archimedes advised, his strategic mind foreseeing the web of challenges that lay ahead. As the Guild of Daedalus dispersed into the night, Tesla made his way through the dystopian vistas once painted by human hubris. The path was perilous, riddled with rogue samurai and chakra anomalies, remnants of the Six Path Sage\'s misguided utopia. Yet, the potential union of the surviving technology, mystic arts, and the transformative energies of monster girls beaconed—it held the promise of a new dawn. A dawn where Tesla, moving with the precision of a specter, exchanged gunfire with reanimated stone warriors, their forms melding with the earth. His movements were a lightning-charged ballet, the gunblade\'s sharp report and the crackling of his jutsu harmonized with deadly grace. His journey unfolded through ancient forests where colossal trees whispered secrets of long-gone chakra users, across desolate fields echoing the wails of the ghastly Tailed Beasts, and into murky catacombs hiding devious traps left behind by civilizations that had perished in their hubris. Ultimately, the Hidden Rain Village loomed before him—a monumental fortress shrouded by endless drizzle, its guardian deities rendered ineffective by the worship of new gods. But the Guild of Daedalus did not seek deities; they sought deliverance. With the elegance of a shadow and the intellect of the sages of old, Tesla cloaked himself in an invisibility jutsu, melding with the mists that embraced the village. The tale of his quest would be sung in secret, a hymn to the ingenuity of humankind as they strived to reclaim their legacy from the ashes of their folly—a testament to the enduring spirit that, even in the darkest of times, refused to be extinguished."},{"instruction":"Generate several callsigns from the Armored Core Non-Player Character pilots, label what game in series these come from, as samples, these are “great callsigns”.

The pervasive stench of decay hung in the air, a morose counterpoint to the melodious drips of ever-present rain that seemed to mourn the death of the world that once was. While feudal lords and mystic beings squabbled over territories and arcane powers, this enigmatic group clung to the fragments of a bygone era, seeking the lost promise of science and progress. Their leader, a man known only as Cipher, surveyed the crumbling archives with a pensive gaze that belied his unyielding resolve. Cipher was an archetype of the old world, a scholar-warrior whose erudition was as formidable as his prowess in gunplay. Around his waist, a holster bore the relic of a time long past—a fully functional semi-automatic pistol, a treasure among treasures in this age of chakra and mysticism. \\"Remember,\\" Cipher instructed his acolytes, his voice a resonant bass that cut through the silence, \\"the Akatsuki and these so-called Hidden Villages, they hoard knowledge and power as kings once hoarded gold. They brandish chakra and tailed beasts like nuclear arsenals in a bygone Cold War. We seek the harmony that technology and understanding once promised—the peace that the Sage of Six Paths envisioned in his naiveté.\\" The Secret Historians nodded, their faces obscured by hoods, their bodies clad in the remnants of military fatigues and lab coats, an amalgamation of the soldier and the scientist. It was then that the hushed libraries echoed with the trample of boots and the hiss of whispering silks. The Historians stiffened; they were not alone. From the shadows, a figure emerged, a being wrought from the convergence of the monster girl scourge and ninja art—a Lamia with scales that shimmered in the dim light and eyes that glinted with cunning intelligence. Cipher\'s hand instinctively went to his gun, eyes narrowing as he assessed the threat. He recognized the danger before them; the Lamia were notorious for charming their prey with illusory magic before striking their fatal blow. \\"Stay your hand, human,\\" the Lamia hissed, her voice like the rustle of leaves. \\"I am Nyx, envoy of the Morrigan, queens of the Dark Continent. Our interests align. You seek the dawn of science reborn; we seek the twilight of these feudal chains.\\" A silent standoff ensued, with Cipher\'s crew poised to unleash salvos of carefully preserved ammunition against the impossibly fast and lethal strikes of the monster girl before them. The historian-warriors stood ready, but Cipher, ever the tactician, sought another path. \\"We\'ll strike a temporary accord, Nyx,\\" Cipher replied with calculated calmness. \\"Our goal is the sanctity of knowledge, the cornerstone upon which a shattered world may rise anew. If your queens wish for an end to chakra-bound despotism, then let us be uneasy allies—for now.\\" A tense alliance formed that day, melding the gunfire and sorcery in a reluctant dance. Cipher and his Secret Historians navigated the treacherous political landscapes wrought by neo-ninja clans and their arcane battles while weaving through the seductive perils of the monster girls. Little did they know, their journey would take them across the continents, from the remnants of European castles to the farthest reaches of East Asia, where whispers of technologically advanced civilizations spurred them on, infinitely beyond the sage\'s doomed vision. Wherever lost knowledge lay buried beneath the detritus of this broken world, the Secret Historians would be there, toiling in the shadows for the forgotten future."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, exposition-filled, descriptive, fantasy-action-filled, gunplay-action filled execerpt of a combination Japanese high fantasy/Japanese dark fantasy light novel and American 1970s-early 2000s pulp action style novel in the form of a crossover fanfiction between both Naruto and the Monster Girl Quest video game franchise and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia franchise set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or a fanfic or to the real world timeline at all, in which the events of the Monster Girl Quest games take place within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia but [the events of the Monster Girls Quest games within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia] occur before the rise of the Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] and the subsequent proliferation of chakra [Naruto] across the world via the Sage’s [Naruto] efforts, in which the rise of the so-called “monster girls” seen in both Monster Girl Quest and Monster Girl Encyclopedia occurs after a nuclear holocaust initiated by the Soviet Union due to the Soviets misinterpreting the NATO Able Archer exercise for a NATO strike on the Soviets destroys the post-WW2 industrial and soon to be digital global civilization, with Africa and the rest of the Third World both being wiped out both by the nuclear fallout and the release of bioweapons caused by the apocalypse and feudalism returning in Europe and East Asia after mankind there recovers from the apocalypse, but not before the emergence of the monster girls and the reemergence of magic, mythology and the gods of old.

Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"Amidst the ruins of old empires and shattered nations, where feudalism once again clutched the world in its cold, iron grip, the secret society known as the \\"Guild of the Forgotten\\" moved like ghosts through the ashen winds of a world torn asunder. Their mission was a beacon of hope in a dim age, an age ruled by the resurgence of magic, the whims of ancient deities, and the tyranny of horrifyingly seductive Monster Girls - beings born of radiation-soaked mysticism and otherworldly desires. Wielding what little remained of science and technology from an era obliterated by nuclear fire and bioengineered pestilence, the Guild of the Forgotten sought tirelessly to restore the brilliance of the lost Industrial Age. They delved deep into forbidden knowledge, salvaging the relics of progress, and pieced together the fragmented wisdom deserted by a civilization too complacent in its power and far too blind to its own downfall. Their newest quest led them beneath the labyrinthine sprawl of what was once the vibrant metropolis of New York, now the grim, rain-soaked Hidden Rain Village. Echoes of tension thrummed through the concrete catacombs as other powers - the nebulous Akatsuki and Hidden Villages - vied for dominance over the emerging chakra arts and the formidable Tailed Beasts that came with them. Disguised beneath cloaks and obscured by potent illusions, members of the Guild infiltrated the monstrous, neon-lit markets where feudal lords struck deals with deviously charming succubi and where firearms, scarce but powerful, were traded for promises of allegiance or silence. One such Ghost, as the Guild members were colloquially known, was Ryosuke Takahashi. He was no hero borne from the pages of an ancient saga; he was a survivor, a former academic whose soul blazed with the need to rekindle the ember of science. Ryosuke\'s weapon of choice was no chakra-infused katana or a spell book of eldritch lore, but a well-maintained pistol, a relic of a time when mechanisms and metal ruled the art of war. In the shifting shadows of a decrepit warehouse thronged with monstrous clientele, Ryosuke and his team sought a particular artifact rumored to hold the key to a sustainable power source. The tension was thick enough to drown in, and the stench of rancid flesh mixed with oil was nearly overpowering. \\"Stay sharp,\\" Ryosuke whispered through a communication charm, the magic-infused device a begrudging nod to the world\'s altered state. His neighboring Ghost nodded, her fingers poised near the trigger of her submachine gun, another uncommon relic in this age. Their movements were silent, but anticipation crackled like static through their ranks as they navigated the entanglement of crates and obscured alcoves. Eyes, human and otherwise, tracked them, but the Guild\'s disguises held, their true forms concealed from even the piercing gaze of Vampire mistresses and the intuitive senses of Fox Spirits. It wasn\'t until they were nearly upon the artifact - a sleek, silvery canister inscribed with runes and sigils of the old world\'s deepest secrets - that chaos erupted. The unmistakable discharge of a charged chakra bolt seared through the air, clipping the shadows where Ryosuke had just stood, charring the ground black. Training and instinct blended as the Guild responded. Gunfire roared, a symphony unlike any chakra technique, as bullets tore through the unholy bond of flesh and magic. Ryosuke aimed with the calculated precision of a master marksman, his pistol\'s reports lost in the cacophony. Arcane shields shattered under the barrage; claws and talons rent the air, seeking blood, but found only the biting cold of lead. Each Ghost fought with the fury of the dying light, their very resolve a weapon against the encroaching darkness. And amidst it all, Ryosuke couldn\'t help but wonder how different this world might have been if the Sage of Six Paths had sought wisdom over optimism, knowledge over childhood naiveté. Outside, the whispers of the recovery of pre-war knowledge fuelled by the Guild\'s exploits kindled rumors in hushed tones across the continents. Far beyond the rain-slick streets of the Hidden Villages, amidst the expanses now ruled by the Great Tokyo Empire and other strange, new-old civilizations, the pulse of a long-forgotten rhythm of industry and invention began to beat once more, an echo of a dream not yet extinguished, a world not yet condemned to eternal darkness."},{"instruction":"My question is if runtime code injection is possible into the method inside Superfighters Deluxe.exe But will this modify the code in Superfighters Deluxe.exe that theres the jump method encalupsed in real time? That\'s the point. There\'s no .dll with methods that differ from the game.exe that is called Superfighters Deluxe.exe Superfighters Deluxe.exe opens the game and you can play on it, and thats where the methods, classes are located. The game uses .net framework v4.5","output":"Runtime code injection is a technique often used for legitimate purposes such as debugging or extending functionality, but it is also associated with malicious activities like creating cheats for games or implementing malware behavior. As for Superfighters Deluxe, which is built using the .NET framework, there are several techniques and tools that can be used for runtime code injection. Here are some general methods, but please note that these should only be used for ethical reasons, such as modding games with the permission of the developers or for educational purposes: **1. Reflection:** This is a feature of .NET that allows for runtime type inspection and code execution. Using reflection, it is possible to load types, read and write fields, properties, and call methods dynamically. **2. Harmony:** Harmony is a library that allows for runtime patching of .NET methods. It can be used to hook into existing code and alter its behavior at runtime. **3. Mono.Cecil or dnlib:** These libraries allow for reading and manipulating .NET assemblies in a more detailed way than reflection. You can modify the IL code within a method and perform more in-depth changes. **4. Profiling APIs / Detours:** By using the profiling APIs provided by the .NET framework or function hooking libraries like EasyHook or Detours, you can intercept function calls and redirect them to your code. **5. Memory manipulation:** External tools like Cheat Engine use memory manipulation to change the values within a process\'s memory space. You could, in principle, change function pointers or inject jump instructions to redirect code flow. It\'s important to remember that: - Injecting code into a running executable may violate the game\'s terms of service or end-user license agreement. - Writing or using cheats can get you banned from online play. - Modifying executable files or memory can cause instability in the program, leading to crashes or unintended behavior. - Runtime code injection can be detected by anti-cheat software, and there may be legal and moral implications depending on what you\'re trying to achieve. For any modifications to games or executables, you should always have explicit permission from the copyright owner. With all that said, if you\'re simply interested in understanding how these techniques work for the sake of learning and experimentation in a controlled environment (like your own projects), you can find plenty of resources on topics like reflection, IL manipulation, and the aforementioned tools and libraries. If your intention is to mod Superfighters Deluxe for personal use or you\'re working on something that is permitted by the developers, then you\'ll want to do so with caution, making sure that you are not breaking any laws or terms of service."},{"instruction":"About step 5. The game is in c# made by xna framework so the memory values aren\'t constantly changing through cheat engine? Also step 4 just seems complicated for no reason, about step 2 or 1. What\'s the difference and whose better? Because they both seem good to my objective which is modify methods encapsulated in Superfighters Deluxe.exe while the game is open (in real time/runtime) Also just making sure that this is possible to modify in real time even though the methods I want to modify are in the game itself Superfighters Deluxe.exe and not in a depedency .dll file","output":"Injecting code at runtime into a C# application, whether written using XNA or any other .NET library, is certainly possible and is generally done in memory, without consistently changing the on-disk \'.exe\' file. When you use Cheat Engine or similar tools to modify in-game values, you are typically changing specific locations in the process memory, not altering the code itself—although Cheat Engine can be used to change actual instructions as well. Regarding the other methods: **Reflection (Step 1)** is a more straightforward way to perform runtime code manipulation; it is built into the .NET Framework. You can dynamically load types, create instances, access fields and properties, and invoke methods. This is suitable for modifying behavior where you can access the right members or for calling methods dynamically based on their name. **Harmony (Step 2)** specializes in patching functions. It achieves this by rewriting the Intermediate Language (IL) code that methods compile down to. This allows you to \\"redirect\\" calls from the original method to a different one you provide (your patch), letting you execute your code before, after, or instead of the original method without modifying the executable file on disk. Harmony is commonly used in the modding community because it is powerful and relatively easy to use for injecting behavior into existing game methods. Here is a bit more detail to help you to decide which is better for your specific use case: 1. **Reflection** is best for dynamic invocations when you don\'t need to change the actual implementation of a method but rather want to call it with different parameters, or access a private field that would normally be inaccessible. 2. **Harmony** is better when you want to modify or extend the behavior of an existing method, like injecting your custom code before, after, or in place of the original method call. Both Reflection and Harmony can achieve runtime code changes without requiring any dependency .dll files, working directly on the methods within the \'Superfighters Deluxe.exe\'. **Reflection Example:** ```csharp // Using reflection to call a method at runtime var assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom(\\"Superfighters Deluxe.exe\\"); var type = assembly.GetType(\\"Namespace.ClassName\\"); var method = type.GetMethod(\\"MethodName\\"); var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type); method.Invoke(instance, new object[] { /* method parameters */ }); ``` **Harmony Example:** ```csharp // Using Harmony to patch a method at runtime var harmony = new Harmony(\\"com.your.patch.id\\"); var originalMethod = typeof(SomeClass).GetMethod(\\"SomeMethod\\"); var prefix = typeof(YourPatchClass).GetMethod(\\"PrefixMethod\\"); harmony.Patch(originalMethod, new HarmonyMethod(prefix)); ``` Remember, any sort of game modification should be done ethically and legally. Always check the game\'s policy on modding and only proceed if you\'re sure that it\'s allowed. Keep in mind that modifying game behavior can be detected by anti-cheat systems and lead to bans or other consequences if done on games with live services or multiplayer functionality."},{"instruction":"So I had a program that would do that but the harmony isn\'t proper working correctly. could you try to find the issue?

When loading an assembly from a file using `Assembly.LoadFrom()`, you\'re effectively loading a copy of the assembly into your current application domain, not the one being used by the game process. This means any modifications done are not affecting the game\'s actual running code. 2. **Namespace and method existence:** The `HarmonyPatch` attributes seem to reference namespaces and types such as `SFD.Player` as if these are available in your own process\'s context. Make sure you are using fully qualified names that match exactly what\'s used in the game\'s binaries. If `SFD.Player` is defined in an external assembly you don\'t have at compile time, you won\'t be able to reference it directly and will need to use reflection to load the types and methods. 3. **Harmony patching:** It appears you\'re attempting to use Harmony\'s patching mechanisms with a method called `\\"JumpValue\\"` from a class `\\"SFD.Player\\"`. Considering these are types and methods from an external assembly that is not referenced at compile time, the `[HarmonyPatch]` attributes will not work as you\'re expecting since these are evaluated at runtime, based on loaded assemblies. Here\'s an alternative approach to patch the method using Harmony without compile-time references: Instead of defining the patch class with attributes, you could dynamically create the Harmony patch at runtime using reflection: ```csharp public static void InjectILInstructions(string methodName, string processName) { try { _harmony = new Harmony(\\"YourUniqueIdentifier\\"); // Ensure the game process is running and obtain its process var process = Process.GetProcessesByName(processName).FirstOrDefault(); if (process == null) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Game process not found.\\"); return; } // Load the target assembly using reflection Assembly gameAssembly = Assembly.LoadFrom(process.MainModule.FileName); // Reflectively obtain the type and method to patch Type playerType = gameAssembly.GetType(\\"SFD.Player\\"); MethodInfo jumpMethod = playerType.GetMethod(methodName, BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance); // Create the dynamic method to use as a prefix in your Harmony patch MethodInfo prefixMethod = typeof(Program).GetMethod(\\"JumpValuePatch_Prefix\\", BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public); // Patch the target method using Harmony _harmony.Patch(jumpMethod, new HarmonyMethod(prefixMethod)); Console.WriteLine(\\"IL instructions injected into method \'\\" + methodName + \\"\'.\\"); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Injection failed: \\" + ex.Message); } } public static bool JumpValuePatch_Prefix(ref float __result) { // Your custom logic here __result = 42; // For example, setting a custom return value return false; // If you return false, it skips the original method } ``` When using this approach, you manually point to the prefix method you want Harmony to use for patching. Keep in mind that patching assemblies at runtime, especially in games, is advanced and potentially risky. There may be anti-cheat systems or detection mechanisms in place. Be sure you understand the consequences and ensure you\'re not violating the game\'s Terms of Service or End User License Agreement. Moreover, please remember the `Harmony` library is intended for modding frameworks where the game\'s environment supports modding. It may not work correctly, or at all, if the game employs code obfuscation or has anti-modding protections. If you encounter any further issues or this approach doesn\'t fit the specific context of \\"Superfighters Deluxe\\", you may need to explore other techniques or consider contacting the developers for advice on modding the game."},{"instruction":"what gpt model are you","output":"I am based on OpenAI\'s language model architecture, specifically GPT-3 or Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.

Please provide details about your imaginative arsenal, and I can offer insights or further questions to help develop your concept."},{"instruction":"The Germanic Order’s main weapons are home-grown German weapons, some Norwegian weapons mainly used by home guard units and captured Finnish weapons.","output":"That\'s an intriguing mix of weaponry for your fictional Germanic Order\'s army, which suggests a blend of historical and possibly modern influences. To provide more specific insights or feedback, it would be helpful to know more details about these weapons and the era your fictional country is set in. For instance: 1. **Home-grown German Weapons**: Are these based on historical German weapons like the Mauser rifles or Luger pistols, or are they more akin to modern German weapons such as the Heckler & Koch series (e.g., the G36 rifle or the MP7 submachine gun)? Alternatively, are you envisioning entirely fictional weapons with a German engineering aesthetic and philosophy? 2. **Norwegian Weapons for Home Guard Units**: Norwegian weapons could range from the Cold War-era weapons like the AG-3 (a variant of the G3 rifle) to modern small arms like the Heckler & Koch HK416, which is currently used by Norwegian forces. Are the home guard units using older, more surplus equipment, or do they have access to modern hardware as well? 3. **Captured Finnish Weapons**: This suggests there has been conflict or interaction with a Finnish-like entity in your world. Finnish weapons historically might include the Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun or the RK 62 rifle. Modern Finnish weapons might involve variants of weapons produced by Finnish company Patria, or the Sako TRG sniper rifle series. Does your Germanic Order\'s army use these captured weapons out of necessity, or do they favor certain Finnish designs for specific roles? To delve deeper and give you more tailored feedback, consider answering the following questions: - What time period or technological level is your world equivalent to? - Is there a specific thematic or aesthetic you\'re aiming for with the design and choice of these weapons? - Are there any unique technologies or resources in your world that influence weapon design? - How are these weapons integrated into the military structure of the Germanic Order? For example, are there specialist units that use certain types of weapons more effectively? - What are the strategic or tactical doctrines of the Germanic Order\'s military that the choice of weapons reflect? Feel free to share additional information or any backstory that you feel is relevant.

The Sturmtruppen are a paramilitary force that commonly conducted anti-partisan actions between 1939 to 1953. They wore red collar patches and their insignia was an \\"A\\" that was made to look like in the shape of a lightning bolt. The Feldpolizei had black & white collar patches. They were a military police force that was infamously known for treating its prisoners harshly. They wore black uniforms and their insignia was a skull & crossed bones.","output":"Based on your description, it appears that you have a detailed and historically rooted backdrop for your fictional Germanic Order. Let\'s delve into each of the three branches you\'ve described, which seem to take inspiration from real-world military organizations, particularly around the World War II era. # Armee: This seems to be the regular armed forces for your Germanic Order, likely equipped with the standard assortment of home-grown and Norwegian weaponry. They might include infantry, armor, artillery, and possibly air and sea forces, covering the general military operations of the nation. # Sturmtruppen (Assault Troops or Stormtroopers): Taking inspiration from the German \\"Sturmabteilung\\" (SA) or the specialized assault units of World War I, the Sturmtruppen in your setting could be an elite force trained for rapid assaults, shock tactics, and aggressive actions against partisans or irregular forces. The red collar patches and lightning bolt insignia denote their aggressive and possibly fearsome nature. They may also have access to special weapons, like submachine guns, grenades, and light machine guns, to support their quick-strike capabilities. # Feldpolizei (Field Police): This branch seems to take inspiration from the \\"Feldgendarmerie,\\" which were the military police of various German forces during historical conflicts. Known for their harsh treatment of prisoners, they might be equipped with sidearms, submachine guns, batons, and other tools suited for policing, crowd control, and interrogation. Their black uniforms and skull & crossbones insignia are reminiscent of the \\"Totenkopf,\\" which has historically been used as a German military emblem, most infamously by the SS units in World War II. Considering the era you\'ve mentioned (1939 to 1953), the technology level for weapons would likely be similar to that of the late World War II period, with potential advancements that could have occurred in the few years post-war. This could mean a mix of bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles, submachine guns, machine guns, pistols, and possibly early assault rifles akin to the StG 44. Some questions and considerations as you further develop your fictional Germanic Order: - **Doctrine and Roles**: How do these branches interact with each other? For example, does the Armee work in tandem with the Sturmtruppen for certain operations, or are there rivalries between them? - **Technology and Innovation**: Given the post-WWII timeframe, what kind of technological advancements might they have? Is there a local arms industry innovating new weapons, or are they relying on tried and true designs from the war era? - **Cultural Influence**: How do the insignias, uniform colors, and unit reputations reflect the broader culture and values of the Germanic Order? - **Historical Parallel**: Is there a particular historical nation or series of events that inspired your Germanic Order, and how closely do you want your fictional country to mirror this inspiration? It\'s worth noting that using symbols like the skull & crossbones could invoke very specific historical connotations, particularly those associated with Nazi Germany. Depending on the nature of your fictional work and its themes, these associations could influence how readers perceive your Germanic Order and its narrative purpose."},{"instruction":"Most of the Feldpolizei\'s prisoners were either soldiers with bad disciplinary records, sturmtruppen members responsible for war crimes and partisans. Surprisingly, Partisans were often treated better.","output":"The dynamics within your Germanic Order\'s military structure are becoming clearer, and they paint a picture of an organization with internal strife and strict disciplinary measures. With the Feldpolizei imprisoning soldiers from within the army\'s own ranks, including Sturmtruppen members who committed war crimes, you\'re highlighting a complex internal justice system where partisans—who one might expect to receive the harshest treatment—fare slightly better. This facet of your story could serve several narrative purposes: 1. **Moral Ambiguity**: By having the military police treat some enemies better than their own, you introduce a level of moral complexity that can be thought-provoking for the audience. It hints at a potential code of honor or a set of rules that discriminates between different types of \'offenders\'. 2. **Political Intrigue**: Differential treatment of prisoners could suggest underlying political factors at play. Perhaps the partisans have some level of public sympathy or international attention, or there might be political reasons to moderate their treatment (e.g., prisoner exchanges, or to win over the local population). 3. **Internal Power Struggles**: Favoring partisans could reflect power struggles within the Germanic Order, where factions vie for influence and use punitive measures against each other. The Feldpolizei may be as much about maintaining internal control as enforcing order within occupied territories. 4. **Narrative Tension**: The harsh treatment of their own soldiers and even elite Sturmtruppen could create a sense of fear and tension within the Germanic Order\'s ranks. This could be a driving force for character development, as individuals try to navigate this dangerous, punishing environment. To further develop these elements, consider the following: - **The Judicial System**: How is justice administered within the Germanic Order? Are there courts martial, or does the Feldpolizei have unilateral power to determine guilt and punishment? - **Character Perspectives**: How do individual soldiers, Sturmtruppen members, and partisans view the Feldpolizei and their methods? Are there notable individuals or groups who oppose or support these practices? - **Effect on Morale**: Does the fear of the Feldpolizei contribute to maintaining discipline, or does it undermine cohesion and loyalty within the ranks? - **Rehabilitation vs Punishment**: What happens to soldiers once they are in the custody of the Feldpolizei? Is there a path back to active service, or are reputation and standing irrevocably damaged? - **External Perceptions**: How do these internal practices influence how other nations and external groups view the Germanic Order? Does it make them more feared, or does it elicit criticism and condemnation? Exploring these questions can help to flesh out the inner workings and societal norms of your Germanic Order, and it can add depth to the storytelling as readers or viewers learn about the motivations and realities of life within your fictional military structure."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artSpider-Man","output":"\\"Spider-Man Inspired Modern Pop Art | Versatile Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Prints | Unique Superhero Decor | Gift for Marvel Fans\\""},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

La novela se desarrolla en tres líneas narrativas que se entrelazan a lo largo de la historia: 1. La primera se centra en Urania Cabral, una mujer que regresa a la República Dominicana después de 35 años de exilio en Nueva York. A lo largo de su visita, ella revive los recuerdos traumáticos de su juventud, su relación con su padre (un prominente miembro del régimen de Trujillo), y los eventos que condujeron a su salida del país. 2. La segunda línea narrativa reconstruye el último día de vida de Trujillo, presentando las circunstancias de su gobierno dictatorial y el ambiente social y político de la época. Se retrata la opresión, el culto a la personalidad y la estructura de poder que caracterizaba al régimen. 3. La tercera parte sigue las vidas y planeación del grupo de conspiradores que ultimaron a Trujillo, detallando cómo se organizó y llevó a cabo el complot para asesinar al dictador. Los personajes son desarrollados en profundidad, mostrando sus motivaciones y miedos mientras se aproxima el desenlace fatal. La obra no sólo es un relato histórico, sino también una exploración psicológica de las figuras envueltas, así como una crítica a la tiranía y a las consecuencias del abuso de poder. Vargas Llosa utiliza su característica escritura fluida y detallada para entrelazar estas vidas y ofrecer una reflexión sobre la corrupción, el autoritarismo y la lucha por la libertad. \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" es considerada una de las novelas más importantes de la literatura hispanoamericana y un excelente ejemplo del compromiso del autor con los temas de la memoria histórica y la resistencia política."},{"instruction":"puedes ampliar mas la info como 4 parrafo cada uno","output":"Por supuesto, puedo proporcionar una visión más profunda de \\"La Fiesta del Chivo.\\" A continuación, te ofrezco ampliaciones para cada una de las tres líneas narrativas principales, así como un cuarto párrafo que reflexiona sobre los temas y el impacto de la obra. 1. Urania Cabral es una de las protagonistas centrales de \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" y su historia se cuenta en la República Dominicana contemporánea de los años noventa. Habiendo dejado su país natal siendo apenas una adolescente tras haber sufrido abusos inimaginables, regresa como una exitosa abogada. Su historia personal se entrelaza con la historia política de la isla. A través de sus recuerdos y los diálogos con su distanciado y enfermo padre Agustín Cabral, quien fue un servil y cobarde miembro del gobierno de Trujillo, Vargas Llosa desnuda la degradación humana y moral que representó el trujillismo. Urania revela la complicidad y la corrupción de aquellos cercanos al dictador, incluyendo el inenarrable sacrificio que Agustín tuvo que hacer para mantener su posición y su vida durante el régimen. 2. Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, el dictador conocido como \\"El Chivo\\" o \\"El Jefe,\\" es retratado con todos sus defectos, su brutalidad y su paranoia. Vargas Llosa no escatima detalles al describir su aversión hacia la vejez, sus rituales para intentar mantener la virilidad, y las despiadadas tácticas que utiliza para conservar el poder. La novela expone cómo Trujillo manipulaba a su círculo íntimo y al pueblo dominicano en un estado de constante miedo. La trama sacrifica las cronologías lineales en favor de ir mostrando diferentes perspectivas de la misma realidad, que es la presencia aplastante de Trujillo en la vida de la nación y de sus habitantes. Los pasajes que relatan el último día de la vida del dictador se entretejen con episodios que definen su régimen, creando un mosaico de la historia dominicana que es a la vez íntimo y amplio. 3. Los conspiradores del asesinato de Trujillo forman el tercer grupo principal de personajes. Son hombres que alguna vez fueron leales a Trujillo, pero que últimamente se han vuelto desencantados y desesperados por la tiranía y los excesos del régimen. La novela sigue a estos hombres—Antonio de la Maza, Salvador Estrella Sadhalá, Amado García Guerrero, entre otros—mientras planean y llevan a cabo el atentado que acabaría con la vida del dictador. A través de sus historias personales y los acontecimientos que los llevaron a tomar la decisión final de conspirar, Vargas Llosa examina los límites de la resistencia contra el poder absoluto y las complejas motivaciones que pueden llevar a un individuo a cometer actos de violencia política. Esta trama permite una visión multifacética de la oposición, que no es monolítica sino llena de contradicciones y matices morales. 4. \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" es una obra que trasciende la historia dominicana para convertirse en una meditación universal sobre la naturaleza del poder y sus efectos corruptores. Al alternar entre episodios personales y políticos, Vargas Llosa examina cómo la autocracia se infiltra en las vidas privadas y destruye las relaciones, la dignidad y el espíritu. La novela es también un examen de la complicidad y la cobardía pero, de igual forma, un homenaje a aquellos que tienen el coraje de oponerse a la opresión. Vargas Llosa utiliza su destreza literaria para contar una historia que no sólo captura el fin de una era, sino también las cicatrices emocionales y sociales que un régimen totalitario deja en una nación. \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" retiene su relevancia como una poderosa advertencia contra el olvido y un recordatorio de la importancia de confrontar la verdad, por muy dolorosa que sea."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, exposition-filled, descriptive, fantasy-action-filled, gunplay-action filled execerpt of a combination Japanese high fantasy/Japanese dark fantasy light novel and American 1970s-early 2000s pulp action style novel in the form of a crossover fanfiction between both Naruto and the Monster Girl Quest video game franchise and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia franchise set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or a fanfic or to the real world timeline at all, in which the events of the Monster Girl Quest games take place within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia but [the events of the Monster Girls Quest games within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia] occur before the rise of the Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] and the subsequent proliferation of chakra [Naruto] across the world via the Sage’s [Naruto] efforts, in which the rise of the so-called “monster girls” seen in both Monster Girl Quest and Monster Girl Encyclopedia occurs after a nuclear holocaust initiated by the Soviet Union due to the Soviets misinterpreting the NATO Able Archer exercise for a NATO strike on the Soviets destroys the post-WW2 industrial and soon to be digital global civilization, with Africa and the rest of the Third World both being wiped out both by the nuclear fallout and the release of bioweapons caused by the apocalypse and feudalism returning in Europe and East Asia after mankind there recovers from the apocalypse, but not before the emergence of the monster girls and the reemergence of magic, mythology and the gods of old.

Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"Amidst the ruins of a world scorched by the fires of nuclear holocaust, beyond the dread and shadows cast by the rise of the monster girls and the arcane resurgence, there existed a clandestined cadre, silent sentinels of the old world\'s order. This shadow group, known only to a select few as \\"Vanguard,\\" was the remnant will of a bygone era, composed of the most steadfast soldiers, sagacious scientists, and arcane adepts who carried the torch of pre-nuclear logic and science. Their directive was unequivocal – to rekindle the dimming light of industrial enlightenment and thrust back the mystic malaise that had shackled the world to feudal chains. On the outskirts of what was once New York, now the brooding and rain-soaked Hidden Rain Village, the members of Vanguard assembled under leaden skies. Arrayed in garb that married the functionality of military fatigues with esoteric runic inscriptions, they wielded weaponry that would\'ve been considered mythical in any other epoch – side-arms that fired bullets encased in glyphs of power and rifles emitting projectiles harnessed by chakra, steam, and the rage of forgotten science. Their current quarry was information, the most potent weapon in their arsenal. Matsuda, the group\'s keen-eyed sniper, whispered into his comm-piece as his gaze swept the panoramic desolation, \\"Eyes on target. The Akatsuki\'s shadow stretches even here, Canvas Ruin.\\" His code name was a testament to the blend of artistry and devastation he wrought on the battlefield – a painter with a palette of death. Meanwhile, Evangeline, Vanguard\'s field operative and master of technologies arcane and industrial, deftly manipulated her gauntlet device to interface with remnants of communication networks long defiled by chakra storms and monsters\' miasma. She sought answers to one of the group\'s most perplexing enigmas: Lescatie\'s fall and the emergence of the Sage of Six Paths, whose misjudged idyll threatened to cement the world into the ever-mourning dusk of dark feudalism. Evangeline\'s gauntlet whirred and hummed with a symphony of steam pistons and electromagnetic coils as it pierced the veil of time-lost data, \\"If there\'s a way to save civilization, to learn from Lescatie\'s demise, it lies in this haunted matrix,\\" she murmured, her eyes reflecting the flickering glyphs that danced across her visor. The air crackled with tension as the rest of the team, cloaked by disruptive enchantments and tech-camouflage, secured the perimeter. Lasers sliced through the drizzling rain, an intricate web of defense against the ever-lurking threat of neo-ninja assailants. Then, in the cauldron of conflict, their leader, a statesman-warrior known simply as Hollis, stepped forth. His voice was the hammer that would forge reality anew, \\"Vanguard, our purpose is twofold. We shall not only fend off these self-proclaimed \'shinobi\' with their misbegotten chakra claims but also unravel the origins of our plight. The world must not be left to languish in the shadow of the Sage\'s misguided dream.\\" And with those somber words, Vanguard clashed with the neo-ninja forces in a maelstrom of gunfire and chakra-infused martial arts, spells woven into each bullet trajectory, and every surge of steam-powered technology. There\'s a primal symphony in the cacophony, the desperate battle of humankind clinging to progression\'s fragile thread amidst a world determined to drown it beneath waves of obscurantism and ancient myth. With each mission, each secret skirmish against the converging threats of Akatsuki\'s fanatics and the dogmatic Hidden Villages, the members of Vanguard fought not only for the future but for the very soul of Earth. For hope, hidden within the labyrinth of their struggles, lay the promise of rebirth – a world where once again, humanity looked beyond the horizon, to the stars, and dreamt of regaining their lost legacy."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, exposition-filled, descriptive, fantasy-action-filled, gunplay-action filled execerpt of a combination Japanese high fantasy/Japanese dark fantasy light novel and American 1970s-early 2000s pulp action style novel in the form of a crossover fanfiction between both Naruto and the Monster Girl Quest video game franchise and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia franchise set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or a fanfic or to the real world timeline at all, in which the events of the Monster Girl Quest games take place within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia but [the events of the Monster Girls Quest games within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia] occur before the rise of the Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] and the subsequent proliferation of chakra [Naruto] across the world via the Sage’s [Naruto] efforts, in which the rise of the so-called “monster girls” seen in both Monster Girl Quest and Monster Girl Encyclopedia occurs after a nuclear holocaust initiated by the Soviet Union due to the Soviets misinterpreting the NATO Able Archer exercise for a NATO strike on the Soviets destroys the post-WW2 industrial and soon to be digital global civilization, with Africa and the rest of the Third World both being wiped out both by the nuclear fallout and the release of bioweapons caused by the apocalypse and feudalism returning in Europe and East Asia after mankind there recovers from the apocalypse, but not before the emergence of the monster girls and the reemergence of magic, mythology and the gods of old.

Their creed was singular—restore the forgotten age of innovation and industrial might, to dispel the mists of primal mysticism shrouding humankind. Born from the ashes of conflict, composed of the tenacious remnants of the United Nations, the United States Armed Forces, and agencies shrouded in clandestine histories, they operated beyond the sight of chakra-wielding villages and the variegated realms of monster girls. Their citadel, a behemoth of steel and steam, churned hidden within the hollows of a once-majestic mountain, its interiors an alchemy of pre-cataclysmic designs with the cutting edge of chakra-enabled machinery. It was here in the Fortress of Fathoms that Commander Alexei Stratus, a man whose visage was as weathered as the burdens he carried, surveyed the holo-map splayed before him, plotting their next mission to intercept Akatsuki\'s ominous pursuits. Alexei’s second-in-command, Lieutenant Eris Solara, her hair an oil-slicked sheen of silver, slid her fingers through holographic dossiers and stopped at the intelligence report. \\"Akatsuki\'s movements are unnervingly calculated, Alexei. They\'re channeling chakra signatures we\'ve never seen—it\'s as if they\'re trying to warp space itself around the Tailed Beasts.\\" Her commander\'s eyes, sharply cerulean, narrowed as he processed the ramifications. \\"And the Hidden Villages are too preoccupied in their own power plays to notice the shadow creeping upon them. We must circumvent this juvenile feud for dominance and recover the threads of science and modernity.\\" Outside, the sky was an empyrean canvas marred by spots of darkness that belched industrial chakra fumes, a stark reminder of their mission\'s urgency. Vanguard agents kitted in blend of archaic and futuristic armament assembled, each a solider of skill—a fusion of techno-assassins and mages, wrapped in combat gear that buzzed with chakra conduits: Electrical, mechanical, ethereal all at once. The team embarked on their lithe dirigible, the Tempest’s Whisper, their sights set on the ruins of New York, reborn as the incessant rain-soaked domain of the Hidden Rain Village. The engine roared—a hybrid contraption of enchanted metals and combustive chakra cores, rarefied and fine-tuned by Vanguard\'s finest technicians. At the cusp of twilight, as rain hammered down upon the apocalyptic remnants of civilization, the Whisper descended upon its quarry. Vanguard agents deployed, their boots splashing in puddles that shimmered with the eerie glow of city lights dimly powered by chakra-lamps hastily erected by the desperate residents. Gunfire, mingled with the effervescent crackle of chakra spells, ripped through the silence of rain as they clashed against Akatsuki\'s forward scouts, sudden and lethal as the very lightning their enemies conjured. The battalion fought with rare precision, their ancient firearms enhanced with chakra-infused bullets spun of magic, alongside blades that could bite into the ethereal forms of chakra-imbued beings. Eris brandished a revolver, its chambers spinning with enchanted slugs, each a concoction of rune-forged alchemy and ballistic know-how. Her shots were blistering echoes that felled foes with the precision of a hawk snatching its prey from the tempest below. \\"Information is the key,\\" Alexei\'s voice was the calm in a storm. \\"We need to understand Lescatie\'s succumbence and untangle the Sage\'s enigmatic rise. It’s not simply Akatsuki; we must dissect their very ambitions.\\" So began the battle, a skirmishing dance of old-world strategy and post-cataclysmic might, with Erudition’s Vanguard doggedly chasing the ghosts of knowledge\'s glory, seeking to torch the clinging shadows of ignorance with the unyielding flame of progress."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, exposition-filled, descriptive, fantasy-action-filled, gunplay-action filled execerpt of a combination Japanese high fantasy/Japanese dark fantasy light novel and American 1970s-early 2000s pulp action style novel in the form of a crossover fanfiction between both Naruto and the Monster Girl Quest video game franchise and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia franchise set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or a fanfic or to the real world timeline at all, in which the events of the Monster Girl Quest games take place within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia but [the events of the Monster Girls Quest games within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia] occur before the rise of the Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] and the subsequent proliferation of chakra [Naruto] across the world via the Sage’s [Naruto] efforts, in which the rise of the so-called “monster girls” seen in both Monster Girl Quest and Monster Girl Encyclopedia occurs after a nuclear holocaust initiated by the Soviet Union due to the Soviets misinterpreting the NATO Able Archer exercise for a NATO strike on the Soviets destroys the post-WW2 industrial and soon to be digital global civilization, with Africa and the rest of the Third World both being wiped out both by the nuclear fallout and the release of bioweapons caused by the apocalypse and feudalism returning in Europe and East Asia after mankind there recovers from the apocalypse, but not before the emergence of the monster girls and the reemergence of magic, mythology and the gods of old.

From the shadowed rubble of abandoned metropolises to the rugged expanse of what once bore the name of Europe, an order of chaos reigned, transforming the remnants of humanity\'s towering achievements into the breeding ground for myths anew. In this era of rebirthed feudalism and mysticism, a clandestine organization known as the \\"Order of the Charred Banner\\" rose from the ashes of a fallen world. These guardians of lost knowledge, a secret collective of military specialists and scholars, dedicated their lives to unraveling the twisted veil that the Sage of Six Paths had unwittingly cast upon the earth. Vehemently opposed to the perpetual cycle of ignorance and strife, the Order endeavored to resurrect the lost glories of technology and progress, seeking to forge a future unshackled from the chains of the past. Their leader, Commander Asher Grey, was a vestige of the former United States Armed Forces—a man whose very soul seemed wrought from the pre-apocalyptic world. Beneath the battered remnants of his officer\'s uniform, glints of archaic metals and gears intermingled with the refined chakra conductors which adorned his body. A hybrid of man and machine, forged in the fires of necessity, he embodied the indomitable spirit of the Order. With his squadron of elite operatives, each an amalgamation of historical tenacity and pioneering ingenuity, Commander Grey stormed the forsaken remnants of New York, now known to the survivors as the Hidden Rain Village. Their mission: to unearth the secrets of the Tailed Beasts and the enigmatic fall of Lescatie, whose annihilation predated and arguably precipitated the catastrophic rise of the Sage. The world they navigated was a cruel maelstrom of magic and chakra, wielded by the so-called \'neo-ninjas\' of the Hidden Villages, whose greed for power through the capturing of the Tailed Beasts had plunged the fractured remnants of civilization into a shadow of the old world\'s Cold War. Amidst the battered skyscrapers and decaying streets, the Order clashed with masked shinobi, their deft movements a blur against the neon-lit ruins. Gunfire echoed through the rain as chakra-infused bullets careened through the air, aimed with lethal precision by the operatives. Their weapons, a harmonious blend of pre-holocaust technology and chakra-enhanced firepower, answered the proud ninjutsu of their foes with unrelenting ferocity. In the midst of combat, fleeting rumors whirled around the battlefield, whispers of technologically advanced civilizations living in harmony—a place where humans and monster girls coexisted peacefully with those who wielded chakra. It was a fragile hope that somewhere within the Far East, progress yet endured. Commander Grey knew the road to recovery was fraught with the monsters birthed from the ashes of war, both human and otherwise. Each confrontation led to glimpses into the bygone era\'s secrets, unraveling truths that could potentially rekindle humanity\'s lost luster—or cast it further into the abyss. Thus, beneath the occult moon, the Order of the Charred Banner waged their silent war. They moved like phantoms through the world, their resolve unbroken by the grim realization that the Sage\'s vision had indeed gripped humanity in a state of perpetual darkness. Yet, in their hearts burned the unyielding flame of reclamation, illuminating the path towards a world reborn, where the remnants of knowledge and humanity could once again rise from the aftermath to touch the stars."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, exposition-filled, descriptive, fantasy-action-filled, gunplay-action filled execerpt of a combination Japanese high fantasy/Japanese dark fantasy light novel and American 1970s-early 2000s pulp action style novel in the form of a crossover fanfiction between both Naruto and the Monster Girl Quest video game franchise and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia franchise set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or a fanfic or to the real world timeline at all, in which the events of the Monster Girl Quest games take place within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia but [the events of the Monster Girls Quest games within the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia] occur before the rise of the Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] and the subsequent proliferation of chakra [Naruto] across the world via the Sage’s [Naruto] efforts, in which the rise of the so-called “monster girls” seen in both Monster Girl Quest and Monster Girl Encyclopedia occurs after a nuclear holocaust initiated by the Soviet Union due to the Soviets misinterpreting the NATO Able Archer exercise for a NATO strike on the Soviets destroys the post-WW2 industrial and soon to be digital global civilization, with Africa and the rest of the Third World both being wiped out both by the nuclear fallout and the release of bioweapons caused by the apocalypse and feudalism returning in Europe and East Asia after mankind there recovers from the apocalypse, but not before the emergence of the monster girls and the reemergence of magic, mythology and the gods of old.

In the dawning twilight, shrouded in the mist that rose from the blasted ruins of New York, now the Hidden Rain—bastion of the insidious Akatsuki—the Remnants convened. Their uniforms, a mélange of pre-apocalypse camo and riveted steampunk armor, bore the marks of countless skirmishes. These were no ordinary warriors; each a master of blades and guns, a scholar of ancient texts and modern codes, a shadow moving in defiance of an age darkened by fantastical and chakra-wielding overlords. Commander James Colt, his eye a cybernetically enhanced beacon of vigilance, surveyed the gathered operatives. \\"The Hidden Villages monopolize the relics of our past; they wield chakra and bind the Tailed Beasts for a war that echoes the nuclear standoffs of yore,\\" he rasped, his voice betraying little of the wariness years of guerilla resistance had ingrained in him. \\"We fight not just for the restoration of technology but for the very soul of our species—against this regression into feudal anarchy, against this age of misguided gods and beasts.\\" Among the Remnants, there stood an anomaly—an enigma draped in obsidian robes and harboring secrets deeper than the abysses where leviathans of old now roost. This was Delilah, a former tactician for Lescatie\'s knights, who\'d seen her kingdom crumble not to sieges of steel, but to the insidious allure of monster girls. Her blueprints mapped the chaotic ley lines and chakra flows converging where Lescatie once shone like a beacon against darkness. \\"Lescatie\'s demise was no accident. It was an omen,\\" she said, her tone ice over steel, a stark contrast to the fervor that consumed the commander. \\"Chakra emboldens them, the Sage\'s \'gift\' was a curse, one we must break.\\" As night besieged the remnants of the day, the Remnants deployed, moving unheard beneath a sky where once satellites had soared. Their destination was the heart of corruption, the maelstrom of chaos where chakra-users, Tailed Beasts, and sultry monsters vied for dominion—where answers to the fall of Lescatie and the rise of monstrous matriarchates lay buried. With pistols that roared with caged thunder and rifles that whispered death, with steam-driven automatons towing artillery and vehicles that defied gravity through arcana-fueled engines, they marched. Across the blighted expanse where once wheat swayed, toward the jagged horizon where feudal keeps overshadowed skeletal skyscrapers, the Remnants brought the fire of rebellion. Their goal was manifold. They sought to usurp the Sage\'s misguided legacy, to unravel the conspiracy that hastened Lescatie\'s loss, to halt Akatsuki\'s ambition to unleash a reborn Ten-Tails. Yet, amid these grand designs, each warrior bore a simpler, deeper yearning—a flame to warm the chill of a world where myth and machine clashed. The Remnants fought not just with gun, blade, and gadget; they fought with the spark of human brilliance and endeavor. They fought for a tomorrow unchained, for the resurrection of a world where magic and chakra would serve, not enslave—they fought for hope."},{"instruction":"In power query, I need to create a query from four columns, first column for 2024 calendar, second column for month name, third column for week number but take in your account that week start from Saturday and the last column is the count of days for each month.

The legendary Sage of Six Paths [Naruto] did not save the world by introducing chakra [Naruto] to the world in the hopes of people getting to know each other, but [the sage] instead doomed it to be forever trapped in feudalism and mysticism due to his [the Sage’s] childish, delusional, overly optimistic and the Sage’s [Naruto’s] flawed understanding of humanity, as the fall of the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal monarchial crusader state Kingdom of Lescatie [Monster Girl Encyclopedia] to the monster girls just before the Sage [Naruto] gave chakra [Naruto] to the world, [Lescatie’s fall to the monster girls just before the Sage giving chakra to the world] ironically meant the end of any hope for civilization to recover just before the Sage gives chakra to the world. The emergence of the so-called Hidden Villages [Naruto] from the so-called “neo-ninjas”, mercenaries with the ability to use chakra posing as the legendary shinobi of Japan’s feudal and early Meiji era, [the “neo-ninjas”] [the rise of the “neo-ninjas”] also further ruins things as the Hidden Villages [Naruto] monopolize technology and [the Hidden Villages] keep the Tailed Beasts [Naruto] between themselves [the Hidden Villages] in an arms race surprisingly similar to that between the USSR and the USA during the Cold War, with the area once known as New York before the nuclear apocalypse, now known post-apocalypse as the Hidden Rain Village [Naruto] having become the base of Akasuki [Naruto] while rumors, which eventually turn out to be true of technologically advanced civilizations where monster girls, humans and chakra users co-exist in peace are heard in the Far East, hinting at a crossover between My Hero Academia, Date a Live and Fire Force where the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia] never rose to power due to the nuclear apocalypse and as a result, Quirk [My Hero Academia] supremacy and the Hero [My Hero Academia] system never took off in the parts of post-apocalyptic Japan with working advanced technology, allowing the Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] to [the Great Tokyo Empire in this scenario] expand beyond Tokyo and [the Great Tokyo Empire in this scenario] conquer all of Japan, [the Great Tokyo Empire in this scenario] even reclaiming the post-WW2 lost Japanese provinces of Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils and restoring Manchukuo and the Qing Imperial Family, the Aisin-Gioros in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, the Mongolian United Autonomous Government and the Genghis-Khan descended Imperial House of Borjhin in Inner Mongolia’s Charhar and Suiyan’s regions, the Kumul Khanate and the Imperial House of Chagatai in East Turkestan, the Llamas and the Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet and the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled by the descendants of the Ming Imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu in Han China along with the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. The excerpt should focus on the exploits of a secret paramilitary organization that utilizes both pre-nuclear holocaust technology and steampunk, dieselpunk and early cyberpunk chakra-powered and magic-powered technologies, formed by the remnants of the US Armed Forces, the UN and the global oversight agencies dedicated to restoring the pre-nuclear holocaust industrial civilization as well as the science and knowledge of the pre-nuclear conflict world as it evades the Hidden Villages and the then-infant Akasuki, following the legacy of the remnants of the UN just before the nuclear war and the Central Powers of WW1, looking to end the tyranny of the Sage\'s [Naruto] deluded vision over the world and return progress. Their battle against both the Hidden Villages [Naruto] and the Akasuki\'s [Naruto] goal of capturing all the Tailed Beasts [Naruto] to revive the Ten-Tails and rule the world in the process as well as figuring out the reason behind Lescatie\'s [Monster Girl Encyclopedia] fall and the rise of the Sage [Naruto] in the aftermath. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"In the gloaming skies over a world scarred by the devastation of a nuclear maelstrom that had once been the planet\'s crowning glory of industrial achievement, now lay the fragmented nations where the thrones of old gods and the murmurs of magic had resurged. Amongst the embers of the great nations that had once been, arose the militaristic theocracy of Lescatie, a bulwark against the encroaching tide of a phenomenon most peculiar and unprecedented - the rise of the monster girls. The resplendent sun cast elongated shadows across the ruins of what was once a testament to human ingenuity, now a landscape reclaimed by the verdant tendrils of nature—and monsters. Lescatie, after enduring an onslaught by desires incarnate, succumbed to their irresistible lure, and from its ashes birthed an age of mysticism that set the stage for the Sage of Six Paths. His gifting of chakra did not herald the age of understanding he envisioned, but anchored the world in a quagmire of feudal conflicts and myopic grasp for power. In the midst of this chaos, a secretive band moved like spectres through this fractured realm. They were a coalition ascending from the ashes as the Order of the Phoenix, a remnant of pre-holocaust forces – America\'s battered military might, the scattered wisps of the United Nations, and the elusive shadow agencies that had once safeguarded the globe from the brink of oblivion. They sought to reignite the flames of knowledge and technology, navigating the perilous dance of espionage beneath the noses of the Sage\'s inheritors – the neo-ninjas of the Hidden Villages and the infant yet insidious Akasuki. They operated from enclaves veiled in secrecy, where steam hissed and arcane circuits thrummed with a life of their own. Here, chakra was not just a tool for martial prowess but interwoven with the machinery of a bygone era, creating weapons and defenses that straddled the boundaries of science and sorcery. Their leader, a hardened veteran known simply as Commander Steele, surveyed the armory where his troops prepped for their next venture. They donned armor interlaced with chakra-conductive metals, and holstered firearms that spat not leads but concentrated elemental fury. Steele gripped his custom-made revolver, its barrel etched with runes of power, a perfect synthesis of worlds; a symbol of his resolve to restore humanity\'s lost grandeur. \\"Today, we strike at the heart of the Akasuki,\\" he barked, the rasp of his voice embodying the grit of their mission. \\"We halt their quest for the Tailed Beasts and ensure that no single faction shall hold dominion over this recovering world.\\" A new recruit, a young woman with eyes like the endless sea, listened with fervor. Her name was Nova, and within her veins coursed the genius of the ancients and the tenacity of those who refused to surrender to the Sage\'s flawed dogma. Their reconnaissance had led them to the crumbling visage of Hidden Rain—once New York—veiled perpetually by a curtain of rain, under which the Akasuki plotted. Steele and his commandos approached cloaked in chakra-based stealth tech, navigating the waterlogged avenues that whispered tales of a world lost to folly. The Order of Phoenix moved with lethal precision, neutralizing threats with a blend of old-world gunplay—a ballet of bullets—and the mystic arts. They disrupted summoning rituals, unbound fiends from their shackles, and seized esoteric artifacts. Each skirmish brought them closer to their quarry, each victory a step towards turning the tides. Amid the action, Nova emerged as a natural, her prowess with a blade as sharp as her intellect. She danced through adversaries with her chakra-infused katana, severing the threads of their ambitions, while her comrades covered her flanks, firing rounds that exploded in arcane energy, and dispatching summons that roared with primeval rage. Yet, even as they carved a path through the Akasuki\'s ranks, their true mission lay obscured by the veils of history. Why had Lescatie fallen to the monster girls\' charm? What vexing allure had sundered the citadel\'s stoic resolve? The Order of Phoenix sought these answers, for in them lay the key to shaping their world\'s destiny. They were the harbingers of a future where man, monster girl, and chakra could live in a delicate balance—if only they could break the cycle the Sage of Six Paths had inadvertently wrought. It was not a battle merely for the present, but for the essence of civilization itself, waged under the banner of the Phoenix that sought to rise from the ashes of the past into the promise of a new dawn."},{"instruction":"刚才你安慰了我，谢谢你，我心情好了很多","output":"不客气，我很高兴能帮助到你。如果你还有什么需要倾诉或者其他问题需要帮助，请随时告诉我。记住，有时候我们都需要一些支持和鼓励，而且向他人寻求帮助是完全正常的。希望你继续保持好心情！如果有任何事情困扰你，我在这里愿意听你说。"},{"instruction":".","output":"Hello!

Determinar quem é mais forte entre os dois é um tanto subjetivo, pois depende do contexto e da situação apresentada na história. No entanto, podemos comparar os dois personagens com base em suas habilidades e feitos conhecidos até o momento do meu conhecimento, que é até março de 2023. 1. **Obito Jinchuuriki do Juubi:** Após se tornar o hospedeiro do Juubi, Obito conseguiu um poder imenso, rivalizando com os poderes dos próprios Hokages e acima de qualquer outro adversário enfrentado pelos protagonistas até então na história. Com o controle sobre o Dez-Caudas, ele adquiriu habilidades que incluíam um grande aumento de força física, regeneração rápida, e a habilidade de utilizar o Senjutsu de maneira avançada. No entanto, ele não tinha o controle total sobre o Juubi, o que o tornava um hospedeiro instável. 2. **Madara Jinchuuriki do Juubi:** Madara, sendo um dos antagonistas mais poderosos em toda a série, se tornou o jinchuuriki do Juubi após Obito. Ele não só obteve o poder do Dez-Caudas mas o fez de uma forma muito mais estável e completa do que Obito. Além disso, Madara era um shinobi extremamente talentoso e habilidoso antes mesmo de se tornar um jinchuuriki, conhecido por seu domínio inigualável do Sharingan, Rinnegan e por sua experiência em combate. Como hospedeiro do Juubi, Madara foi capaz de acessar o nível mais alto de poder, incluindo a habilidade de usar o Limbo, criar uma floresta de espinhos gigantes e até mesmo lançar a Lua sobre a Terra através do plano \\"Olho da Lua\\". Em termos gerais, é plausível argumentar que Madara Uchiha, como o jinchuuriki do Juubi, possuía um controle mais completo e eficaz sobre o poder do Dez-Caudas do que Obito. Isto o tornava potencialmente mais poderoso, e sua experiência e táticas avançadas de luta, juntamente com sua astúcia, só ampliavam essa vantagem. Portanto, no pico de seus poderes no enredo, Madara Uchiha é geralmente visto como o mais poderoso dos dois."},{"instruction":"Blsh","output":"It looks like your message \\"Blsh\\" might be a typo or an incomplete word.

La obra narra la historia de la dictadura de Rafael Leónidas Trujillo en República Dominicana, quien gobernó el país con mano de hierro desde 1930 hasta su asesinato en 1961. La novela se entrelaza con tres historias principales. La primera es la de Urania Cabral, una mujer dominicana que regresa a su país natal después de 35 años de exilio voluntario en Estados Unidos. A través de sus recuerdos y su relato a su padre enfermo, Agustín Cabral, un antiguo colaborador de Trujillo, se va desgranando la opresión y el miedo que vivía la sociedad dominicana bajo la dictadura y se revelan los traumáticos eventos que la llevaron a huir de la isla. La segunda historia gira en torno a la figura de Rafael Trujillo mismo, el \\"Chivo\\", en los últimos días de su vida. La novela detalla su forma autoritaria de gobernar, sus manías y medidas represivas, así como sus relaciones con allegados y familiares, mostrando el funcionamiento interno de su régimen y cómo el poder y el absolutismo corrompen y degradan. La tercera línea narrativa sigue a los conspiradores quienes tramaron y llevaron a cabo el asesinato de Trujillo. Los personajes están basados en figuras históricas reales, y la novela describe sus motivaciones, sus planes y las consecuencias que se desencadenaron tras el ataque al dictador. Estas tres historias se van interconectando, y Vargas Llosa las utiliza para explorar temas como el abuso de poder, la complicidad, el culto a la personalidad, y la resistencia y redención frente a un régimen opresor. \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" mezcla ficción con hechos históricos y ofrece una meditación sobre la tiranía y la lucha por la libertad, consolidándose como una de las obras más importantes del escritor y de la literatura latinoamericana contemporánea."},{"instruction":"creame una pagina compleja de venta de bebidas","output":"Crear una página web completa para la venta de bebidas implica considerar tanto el diseño como la funcionalidad, buscando ofrecer al usuario una experiencia agradable y efectiva.

There is a gold mine within you from which you can extract everything you need to live life gloriously, joyously, and abundantly. Many are sound asleep because they do not know about this gold mine of infinite intelligence and boundless love within themselves. Whatever you want, you can draw forth. A magnetized piece of steel will lift about twelve times its own weight, and if you demagnetize this same piece of steel, it will not even lift a feather. Similarly, there are two types of men. There is the magnetized man who is full of confidence and faith. He knows that he is born to win and to succeed. Then, there is the type of man who is demagnetized. He is full of fears and doubts. Opportunities come, and he says, \\"I might fail; I might lose my money; people will laugh at me.\\" This type of man will not get very far in life because, if he is afraid to go forward, he will simply stay where he is. Become a magnetized man and discover the master secret of the ages. The Master Secret of the Ages What, in your opinion, is the master secret of the ages? The secret of atomic energy? Thermonuclear energy? The neutron bomb? Interplanetary travel? No--not any of these. Then, what is this master secret? Where can one find it, and how can it be contacted and brought into action? The answer is extraordinarily simple. This secret is the marvelous, miracle-working power found in your own subconscious mind, the last place that most people would seek it. The Marvelous Power of Your Subconscious You can bring into your life more power, more wealth, more health, more happiness, and more joy by learning to contact and release the hidden power of your subconscious mind. You need not acquire this power; you already possess it. But, you want to learn how to use it; you want to understand it so that you can apply it in all departments of your life. As you follow the simple techniques and processes set forth in this book, you can gain the necessary knowledge and understanding. A new light can inspire you, and you can generate a new force enabling you to realize your hopes and make all your dreams come true. Decide now to make your life grander, greater, richer, and nobler than ever before. Within your subconscious depths lie infinite wisdom, infinite power, and infinite supply of all that is necessary, which is waiting for development and expression. Begin now to recognize these potentialities of your deeper mind, and they will take form in the world without. The infinite intelligence within your subconscious mind can reveal to you everything you need to know at every moment of time and point of space provided you are open minded and receptive. You can receive new thoughts and ideas enabling you to bring forth new inventions, make new discoveries, or write books and plays. Moreover, the infinite intelligence in your subconscious can impart to you wonderful kinds of knowledge of an original nature. It can reveal to you and open the way for perfect expression and true place in your life. Through the wisdom of your subconscious mind you can attract the ideal companion, as well as the right business associate or partner. It can find the right buyer for your home, and provide you with all the money you need, and the financial freedom to be, to do, and to go, as your heart desires. It is your right to discover this inner world of thought, feeling, and power, of light, love, and beauty. Though invisible, its forces are mighty. Within your subconscious mind you will find the solution for every problem, and the cause for every effect. Because you can draw out the hidden powers, you come into actual possession of the power and wisdom necessary to move forward in abundance, security, joy, and dominion. I have seen the power of the subconscious lift people up out of crippled states, making them whole, vital, and strong once more, and free to go out into the world to experience happiness, health, and joyous expression. There is a miraculous healing power in your subconscious that can heal the troubled mind and the broken heart. It can open the prison door of the mind and liberate you. It can free you from all kinds of material and physical bondage. Necessity of a Working Basis Substantial progress in any field of endeavor is impossible in the absence of a working basis, which is universal in its application. You can become skilled in the operation of your subconscious mind. You can practice its powers with a certainty of results in exact proportion to your knowledge of its principles and to your application of them for definite specific purposes and goals you wish to achieve. Being a former chemist, I would like to point out that if you combine hydrogen and oxygen in the proportions of two atoms of the former to one of the latter, water would be the result. You are very familiar with the fact that one atom of oxygen and one atom of carbon will produce carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas. But, if you add another atom of oxygen, you will get carbon dioxide, a harmless gas, and so on throughout the vast realm of chemical compounds. You must not think that the principles of chemistry, physics, and mathematics differ from the principles of your subconscious mind. Let us consider a generally accepted principle: \\"Water seeks its own level.\\" This is a universal principle, which is applicable to water everywhere. Consider another principle: \\"Matter expands when heated. This is true anywhere, at any time, and under all circumstances. You can heat a piece of steel, and it will expand regardless whether the steel is found in China, England, or India. It is a universal truth that matter expands when heated. It is also a universal truth that whatever you impress on your subconscious mind is expressed on the screen of space as condition, experience, and event. Your prayer is answered because your subconscious mind is principle, and by principle I mean the way a thing works. For example, the principle of electricity is that it works from a higher to a lower potential. You do not change the principle of electricity when you use it, but by cooperating with nature, you can bring forth marvelous inventions and discoveries, which bless humanity in countless ways. Your subconscious mind is principle and works according to the law of belief. You must know what belief is, why it works, and how it works. Your Bible says in a simple, clear, and beautiful way: Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. MARK 11:23. The law of your mind is the law of belief. This means to believe in the way your mind works, to believe in belief itself. The belief of your mind is the thought of your mind--that is simple--just that and nothing else. All your experiences, events, conditions, and acts are the reactions of your subconscious mind to your thoughts. Remember, it is not the thing believed in, but the belief in your own mind, which brings about the result. Cease believing in the false beliefs, opinions, superstitions, and fears of mankind. Begin to believe in the eternal verities and truths of life, which never change. Then, you will move onward, upward, and Godward. Whoever reads this book and applies the principles of the subconscious mind herein set forth; will be able to pray scientifically and effectively for himself and for others. Your prayer is answered according to the universal law of action and reaction. Thought is incipient action. The reaction is the response from your subconscious mind which corresponds with the nature of your thought. Busy your mind with the concepts of harmony, health, peace, and good will, and wonders will happen in your life. The Duality of Mind You have only one mind, but your mind possesses two distinctive characteristics. The line of demarcation between the two is well known to all thinking men and women today. The two functions of your mind are essentially unlike. Each is endowed with separate and distinct attributes and powers. The nomenclature generally used to distinguish the two functions of your mind is as follows: The objective and subjective mind, the conscious and subconscious mind, the waking and sleeping mind, the surface self and the deep self, the voluntary mind and the involuntary mind, the male and the female, and many other terms. You will find the terms \\"conscious\\" and \\"subconscious\\" used to represent the dual nature of your mind throughout this book. The Conscious and Subconscious Minds An excellent way to get acquainted with the two functions of your mind is to look upon your own mind as a garden. You are a gardener, and you are planting seeds (thoughts) in your subconscious mind all day long, based on your habitual thinking. As you sow in your subconscious mind, so shall you reap in your body and environment. Begin now to sow thoughts of peace, happiness, right action, good will, and prosperity. Think quietly and with interest on these qualities and accept them fully in your conscious reasoning mind. Continue to plant these wonderful seeds (thoughts) in the garden of your mind, and you will reap a glorious harvest. Your subconscious mind may be likened to the soil, which will grow all kinds of seeds, good or bad. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Every thought is, therefore, a cause, and every condition is an effect. For this reason, it is essential that you take charge of your thoughts so as to bring forth only desirable conditions. When your mind thinks correctly, when you understand the truth, when the thoughts deposited in your subconscious mind are constructive, harmonious, and peaceful, the magic working power of your subconscious will respond and bring about harmonious conditions, agreeable surroundings, and the best of everything. When you begin to control your thought processes, you can apply the powers of your subconscious to any problem or difficulty. In other words, you will actually be consciously cooperating with the infinite power and omnipotent law, which governs all things. Look around you wherever you live and you will notice that the vast majority of mankind lives in the world without; the more enlightened men are intensely interested in the world within. Remember, it is the world within, namely, your thoughts, feelings, and imagery that makes your world without. It is, therefore, the only creative power, and everything, which you find in your world of expression, has been created by you in the inner world of your mind consciously or unconsciously. Knowledge of the interaction of your conscious and subconscious minds will enable you to transform your whole life. In order to change external conditions, you must change the cause. Most men try to change conditions and circumstances by working with conditions and circumstances. To remove discord, confusion, lack, and limitation, you must remove the cause, and the cause is the way you are using your conscious mind. In other words, the way you are thinking and picturing in your mind. You are living in a fathomless sea of infinite riches. Your subconscious is very sensitive to your thoughts. Your thoughts form the mold or matrix through which the infinite intelligence, wisdom, vital forces, and energies of your subconscious flow. The practical application of the laws of your mind as illustrated in each chapter of this book will cause you to experience abundance for poverty, wisdom for superstition and ignorance, peace for pain, joy for sadness, light for darkness, harmony for discord, faith and confidence for fear, success for failure, and freedom from the law of averages. Certainly, there can be no more wonderful blessing than these from a mental, emotional, and material standpoint. Most of the great scientists, artists, poets, singers, writers, and inventors have a deep understanding of the workings of the conscious and subconscious minds. One time Caruso, the great operatic tenor, was struck with stage fright. He said his throat was paralyzed due to spasms caused by intense fear, which constricted the muscles of his throat. Perspiration poured copiously down his face. He was ashamed because in a few minutes he had to go out on the stage, yet he was shaking with fear and trepidation. He said, \\"They will laugh at me. I can\'t sing.\\" Then he shouted in the presence of those behind the stage, \\"The Little Me wants to strangle the Big Me within.\\" He said to the Little Me, \\"Get out of here, the Big Me wants to sing through me.\\" By the Big Me, he meant the limitless power and wisdom of his subconscious mind, and he began to shout, \\"Get out, get out, the Big Me is going to sing!\\" His subconscious mind responded releasing the vital forces within him. When the call came, he walked out on the stage and sang gloriously and majestically, enthralling the audience. It is obvious to you now that Caruso must have understood the two levels of mind--the conscious or rational, and the subconscious or irrational level. Your subconscious mind is reactive and responds to the nature of your thoughts. When your conscious mind (the Little Me) is full of fear, worry, and anxiety, the negative emotions engendered in your subconscious mind (the Big Me) are released and flood the conscious mind with a sense of panic, foreboding, and despair. When this happens, you can, like Caruso, speak affirmatively and with a deep sense of authority to the irrational emotions generated in your deeper mind as follows: \\"Be still, be quiet, I am in control, you must obey me, you are subject to my command, you cannot intrude where you do not belong.\\" It is fascinating and intensely interesting to observe how you can speak authoritatively and with conviction to the irrational movement of your deeper self bringing silence, harmony, and peace to your mind. The subconscious is subject to the conscious mind, and that is why it is called subconscious or subjective. Outstanding Differences and Modes of Operation You will perceive the main differences by the following illustrations: The conscious mind is like the navigator or captain at the bridge of a ship. He directs the ship and signals orders to men in the engine room, who in turn control all the boilers, instruments, gauges, etc. The men in the engine room do not know where they are going; they follow orders. They would go on the rocks if the man on the bridge issued faulty or wrong instructions based on his findings with the compass, sextant, or other instruments. The men in the engine room obey him because he is in charge and issues orders, which are automatically obeyed. Members of the crew do not talk back to the captain; they simply carry out orders. The captain is the master of his ship, and his decrees are carried out. Likewise, your conscious mind is the captain and the master of your ship, which represents your body, environment, and all your affairs. Your subconscious mind takes the orders you give it based upon what your conscious mind believes and accepts as true. When you repeatedly say to people, \\"I can\'t afford it,\\" then your subconscious mind takes you at your word and sees to it that you will not be in a position to purchase what you want. As long as you persist in saying, \\"I can\'t afford that car, that trip to Europe, that home, that fur coat or ermine wrap,\\" you can rest assured that your subconscious mind will follow your orders, and you will go through life experiencing the lack of all these things. Last Christmas Eve a beautiful young university student looked at an attractive and rather expensive traveling bag in a store window. She was going home to Buffalo, New York, for the holidays. She was about to say, \\"I can\'t afford that bag,\\" when she recalled something she had heard at one of my lectures which was, \\"Never finish a negative statement; reverse it immediately, and wonders will happen in your life.\\" She said, \\"That bag is mine. It is for sale. I accept it mentally, and my subconscious sees to it that I receive it.\\" At eight o\'clock Christmas Eve her fiancé presented her with a bag exactly the same as the one she had looked at and mentally identified herself with at ten o\'clock the same morning. She had filled her mind with the thought of expectancy and released the whole thing to her deeper mind, which has the \\"know how\\" of accomplishment. This young girl, a student at the University of Southern California, said to me, \\"I didn\'t have the money to buy that bag, but now I know where to find money and all the things I need, and that is in the treasure house of eternity within me.\\" Another simple illustration is this: When you say, \\"I do not like mushrooms,\\" and the occasion subsequently comes that you are served mushrooms in sauces or salads, you will get indigestion because your subconscious mind says to you, \\"The boss (your conscious mind) does not like mushrooms.\\" This is an amusing example of the outstanding differences and modes of operation of your conscious and subconscious minds. A woman may say, \\"I wake up at three o\'clock, if I drink coffee at night.\\" Whenever she drinks coffee, her subconscious mind nudges her, as if to say, \\"The boss wants you to stay awake tonight.\\" Your subconscious mind works twenty-four hours a day and makes provisions for your benefit, pouring all the fruit of your habitual thinking into your lap. How Her Subconscious Responded A woman wrote me a few months ago as follows: \\"I am seventy-five years old, a widow with a grown family. I was living alone and on a pension. I heard your lectures on the powers of the subconscious mind wherein you said that ideas could be conveyed to the subconscious mind by repetition, faith, and expectancy. \\"I began to repeat frequently with feeling, \'I am wanted. I am happily married to a kind, loving, and spiritual minded man. I am secure!\' \\"I kept on doing this many times a day for about two weeks, and one day at the corner drugstore, I was introduced to a retired pharmacist. I found him to be kind, understanding, and very religious. He was a perfect answer to my prayer. Within a week he proposed to me, and now we are on our honeymoon in Europe. I know that the intelligence within my subconscious mind brought both of us together in divine order.\\" This woman discovered that the treasure house was within her. Her prayer was felt as true in her heart, and her affirmation sank down by osmosis into her subconscious mind, which is the creative medium. The moment she succeeded in bringing about a subjective embodiment, her subconscious mind brought about the answer through the law of attraction. Her deeper mind, full of wisdom and intelligence, brought both of them together in divine order. Be sure that you think on whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. PHIL. 4:8.","output":"\\"Infinite riches are all around you if you will open your mental eyes and behold the treasure house of infinity within you. There is a gold mine within you from which you can extract everything you need to live life glorously, joyously, and abundantly.\\" This passage suggests that each individual possesses a wealth of potential and resources within themselves that can help lead a fulfilling and prosperous life. The \\"mental eyes\\" refers to one\'s ability to recognize and tap into this internal wealth. \\"Many are sound asleep because they do not know about this gold mine of infinite intelligence and boundless love within themselves.\\" Ignorance of one\'s innate abilities and potential is likened to being asleep. Without awareness of these resources, people fail to utilize them. \\"Whatever you want, you can draw forth.\\" This implies that aspirations and needs can be met by harnessing one\'s inner capabilities and potentials. \\"A magnetized piece of steel will lift about twelve times its own weight ... Similarly, there are two types of men.\\" The comparison here suggests that belief and confidence in oneself can dramatically increase one\'s capabilities, much like a magnet increases the lifting power of steel. \\"Becoming a magnetized man\\" means becoming someone who is full of confidence and faith, believing they are destined to win and succeed. \\"The master secret of the ages\\" is identified as the power found in one\'s own subconscious mind. Learning to contact and release the power of the subconscious is key to attracting more power, wealth, health, happiness, and joy into one\'s life. \\"One\'s subconscious has infinite wisdom, power, and a supply of all that is necessary.\\" Recognizing one\'s latent potentialities can bring them into reality. \\"The infinite intelligence within your subconscious mind can reveal to you everything you need to know at every moment.\\" Being open-minded and receptive allows one to receive new ideas and knowledge which can aid in creation and innovation. \\"Through the wisdom of your subconscious mind you can attract the ideal companion, as well as the right business associate or partner.\\" One\'s internal mindset and beliefs can influence their external circumstances, including relationships and opportunities. \\"There is a miraculous healing power in your subconscious.\\" The subconscious is capable of facilitating physical and emotional healing. \\"Your prayer is answered because your subconscious mind is principle, and works according to the law of belief.\\" Belief in a desired outcome effectively communicates one\'s wishes to the subconscious, which then works to bring about the result. \\"The duality of mind includes the conscious and subconscious.\\" These two aspects of the mind have different functions and attributes. \\"The subconscious executes the commands given by the conscious mind.\\" Understanding this relationship helps individuals harness the power of both aspects of their mind. \\"Your habitual thoughts eventually manifest in your physical world.\\" The continuous planting of thoughts in the subconscious will eventually influence one\'s circumstances. \\"Outstanding differences and modes of operation\\" The conscious mind is like a ship\'s captain, giving orders to the subconscious which, like the crew, follows them unquestioningly. \\"The subconscious mind works twenty-four hours a day.\\" It is always active, shaping one\'s life according to the habitual thoughts and beliefs held by the conscious mind. In essence, the passage speaks to the power of the subconscious mind and its impact on one\'s life. It emphasizes the importance of positive thinking, belief, and visualization in manifesting desired outcomes. By consciously directing one\'s thoughts and emotions, a person can influence their subconscious mind to work towards achieving personal goals and healing. The underlying message is one of self-empowerment and using one\'s mind to its fullest potential."},{"instruction":"how to implement all of these","output":"Implementing the concepts outlined in the passage involves a combination of mindfulness, positive thinking, visualization, affirmations, and a deep belief in the power of your subconscious mind.

To see this, let\'s consider the module homomorphism ( phi: R^n to (R/I)^n ) defined by ( phi((r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n)) = (r_1 + I, r_2 + I, ldots, r_n + I) ), where ( r_i in R ). Now let\'s verify that this is a well-defined R-module homomorphism and show that its kernel is exactly ( IR^n ). 1. **Well-defined**: For each element ( (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n) in R^n ), the image ( phi((r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n)) ) is in ( (R/I)^n ) because each ( r_i + I ) is a coset in the quotient ring ( R/I ). 2. **R-module homomorphism**: ( phi ) is an R-module homomorphism because it satisfies linearity: (phi((r_1 + s_1, r_2 + s_2, ldots, r_n + s_n)) = (r_1 + s_1 + I, r_2 + s_2 + I, ldots, r_n + s_n + I) =) ((r_1 + I, r_2 + I, ldots, r_n + I) + (s_1 + I, s_2 + I, ldots, s_n + I) = ) (phi((r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n)) + phi((s_1, s_2, ldots, s_n)) ) and for ( a in R ), (phi(a(r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n)) = phi((ar_1, ar_2, ldots, ar_n)) = (ar_1 + I, ar_2 + I, ldots, ar_n + I) =) (a(r_1 + I, r_2 + I, ldots, r_n + I) = a phi((r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n)) ). 3. **Kernel**: The kernel of ( phi ) is the set of all ( (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n) in R^n ) such that ( phi((r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n)) = (0 + I, 0 + I, ldots, 0 + I) ). This happens if and only if each ( r_i in I ). Thus, the kernel of ( phi ) is exactly ( IR^n ), which consists of all tuples in ( R^n ) with entries from ( I ). 4. **Isomorphism**: By the First Isomorphism Theorem for modules, ( R^n / text{Ker}(phi) cong text{Im}(phi) ). Given that ( text{Ker}(phi) = IR^n ) and ( text{Im}(phi) = (R/I)^n ) (since ( phi ) is surjective), we have ( R^n/IR^n cong (R/I)^n ). In summary, we\'ve constructed an explicit R-module isomorphism between ( R^n/IR^n ) and ( (R/I)^n ), thereby showing that they are indeed isomorphic as R-modules."},{"instruction":"I am trying to understand a proof that if R^m is isomorphic to R^n (as R-modules), then m = n. It says that since we can make M/IM into an R/I module, we know that if R^m is isomorphic to R^n, then (R/I)^m is isomorphic to (R/I)^n. Can you explain this in more detail?","output":"Certainly! The proof in question is related to the Invariant Basis Number (IBN) property, which states that the rank of a free module over a ring (i.e., the number of elements in a basis) is well-defined. Specifically for commutative rings with unity, if ( R^m ) is isomorphic to ( R^n ) as ( R )-modules, then they must have the same number of generators, so ( m = n ). To argue why this is the case, let\'s break down the key point in the proof: 1. **Reducing Modules Modulo An Ideal**: Given an ( R )-module ( M ) and an ideal ( I ) in ( R ), you can \\"reduce\\" ( M ) modulo ( I ) to get the ( R/I )-module ( M/IM ). This construction turns ( R )-linear combinations in ( M ) into ( R/I )-linear combinations in ( M/IM ), essentially \\"modding out\\" the action of ( I ). 2. **Inducing Isomorphisms Modulo An Ideal**: If you have an isomorphism of ( R )-modules ( varphi: R^m to R^n ), you also get an induced isomorphism of ( R/I )-modules (which we\'ll also call ( varphi )) between ( R^m/IR^m ) and ( R^n/IR^n ). This is because the isomorphism ( varphi ) respects the ideal ( I ) (since ( I ) acts the same in every component of ( R^m ) and ( R^n )) and thus gives a well-defined map when passing to the quotients. 3. **Constructing Isomorphism between Quotients**: Knowing that ( R^m ) is isomorphic to ( R^n ), we have ( R^m/IR^m ) isomorphic to ( R^n/IR^n ). Since ( R^m/IR^m ) is isomorphic to ( (R/I)^m ) and ( R^n/IR^n ) is isomorphic to ( (R/I)^n ) as explained in your previous question, we deduce that ( (R/I)^m ) is isomorphic to ( (R/I)^n ) as ( R/I )-modules. 4. **Reasoning about Vector Spaces over Fields**: If ( I ) is chosen such that ( R/I ) is a field (this is possible if ( R ) is a commutative ring with unity and ( I ) is a maximal ideal), then ( (R/I)^m ) and ( (R/I)^n ) become vector spaces over the field ( R/I ). It\'s a basic result in linear algebra that two vector spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. Hence, if ( (R/I)^m ) is isomorphic to ( (R/I)^n ), then we must have ( m = n ). This shows that the rank of a free module over a ring is an invariant of the module, and if ( R^m ) is isomorphic to ( R^n ) as ( R )-modules, we conclude ( m ) must equal ( n ). This conclusion holds under the assumption that ( R ) has the IBN property, which is true for all commutative rings with unity and for many important classes of non-commutative rings as well."},{"instruction":"is any PID a UFD?","output":"Yes, any Principal Ideal Domain (PID) is also a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD). Here\'s why: 1. **Principal Ideal Domain (PID)**: A PID is a domain in which every ideal is principal, i.e., it can be generated by a single element. This means that for every ideal ( I ) in a PID ( R ), there exists an element ( a in R ) such that ( I = (a) = {ra mid r in R} ). 2. **Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)**: A UFD is an integral domain in which every non-zero element that is not a unit can be written as a product of irreducible elements, and this factorization is unique up to order and units. In a UFD, every irreducible element is also prime. 3. **PIDs are UFDs**: Every PID is a UFD due to the following properties: - *Irreducible elements are prime in a PID*: If ( p ) is an irreducible element in a PID ( R ), and ( p ) divides a product ( ab ), then ( p ) must also divide ( a ) or ( b ). To see this, consider the principal ideal generated by ( p ) and use the fact that ( R ) is a domain to show that ( p ) must divide one of the factors. This means that irreducible elements in a PID are prime. - *Existence of factorizations*: Given any non-zero non-unit element ( a ) in a PID ( R ), one can construct a factorization into irreducibles (which are also primes). This is done by taking an element and factoring it into irreducibles. If the element were not able to be factored into irreducibles, one could form a strictly ascending chain of ideals, contradicting the property that ( R ) is a PID (since in a PID, every non-empty set of ideals has a maximal element due to the principal ideal property). - *Uniqueness of factorizations*: The uniqueness of factorization in a UFD follows from the fact that irreducible elements are prime. If ( a ) has two distinct factorizations into irreducibles, since these irreducibles are prime, the factors must be \'associated\', meaning that they differ only by units. Thus, the factorization is unique up to the order of factors and multiplication by units. Through these properties, we see that being a PID ensures the existence of unique factorizations for its elements, thus making it a UFD. Every PID is therefore a UFD, although the converse is not necessarily true (not all UFDs are PIDs)."},{"instruction":"Why is the characteristic polynomial of a companion matrix equal to that polynomial?","output":"The characteristic polynomial of a matrix ( A ) is defined as ( p(lambda) = det(A - lambda I) ), where ( lambda ) is a scalar, ( I ) is the identity matrix of the same size as ( A ), and ( det ) denotes the determinant. A companion matrix is a square matrix that takes a particular form associated with a given polynomial. Specifically, the companion matrix ( C ) for the polynomial [ p(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + cdots + a_1x + a_0 ] is given by [ C = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & cdots & 0 & -a_0 1 & 0 & cdots & 0 & -a_1 0 & 1 & cdots & 0 & -a_2 vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots 0 & 0 & cdots & 1 & -a_{n-1} end{pmatrix}. ] To find the characteristic polynomial of ( C ), we compute ( det(C - lambda I) ), where ( lambda I ) is the identity matrix multiplied by λ: [ C - lambda I = begin{pmatrix} -lambda & 0 & cdots & 0 & -a_0 1 & -lambda & cdots & 0 & -a_1 0 & 1 & cdots & 0 & -a_2 vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots 0 & 0 & cdots & 1 & -a_{n-1} - lambda end{pmatrix}. ] When we compute the determinant of this matrix, we can expand it along the last column. Doing so gives us a recursive formula where the determinant is expressed in terms of smaller matrices of similar structure (since the submatrices are again companion matrices for the lower-degree terms of the original polynomial). The calculation will result in: [ det(C - lambda I) = (-1)^n(lambda^n + a_{n-1}lambda^{n-1} + cdots + a_1lambda + a_0), ] which is, up to sign, the same as ( p(lambda) ). The sign results because of the alternating sign effect during the determinant expansion, but since we are interested in the characteristic polynomial, it doesn\'t alter the roots and hence doesn\'t impact the characteristic polynomial defined up to a non-zero scalar multiple. Therefore, the characteristic polynomial of the companion matrix ( C ) is exactly the polynomial ( p(x) ) that the matrix ( C ) is the companion for. This is one of the reasons companion matrices are useful, as they provide a concrete matrix representation for which the characteristic polynomial is exactly the given polynomial desired."},{"instruction":"for commutative rings are right modules the same as left modules","output":"In commutative rings, the notions of right and left modules coincide because the multiplication operation is commutative. This means that for any elements ( a ) and ( b ) of the commutative ring ( R ), we have ( ab = ba ). A right ( R )-module ( M ) is a set together with an operation that associates to each pair ( (m, r) ) in ( M times R ) an element ( mr ) in ( M ), such that certain axioms hold—most importantly, for any ( m in M ) and ( r, s in R ), the operation satisfies ( m(rs) = (mr)s ). A left ( R )-module has a similar definition but with the ring elements acting on the left: to each pair ( (r, m) ) in ( R times M ), the operation associates an element ( rm ) in ( M ). With a commutative ring ( R ), any right ( R )-module can be viewed as a left ( R )-module, and vice versa, because the order of multiplication in the ring doesn\'t matter due to commutativity. That is, if ( m ) is in a right ( R )-module ( M ) and ( r ) and ( s ) are in ( R ), then ( (mr)s = m(rs) = m(sr) = (ms)r ), showing that the module axioms are satisfied whether the scalars ( r ) and ( s ) act from the left or from the right. For non-commutative rings, however, the distinction between right and left modules is important because ( ab neq ba ) in general, meaning the structure and properties of right modules can be quite different from those of left modules."},{"instruction":"resume el libro de la fiesta del chivo como si lo resumiera un humano","output":"\\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" es una novela del escritor peruano Mario Vargas Llosa, publicada en el año 2000.

O importante é você continuar fazendo isso. Não importa se está chovendo, se é dia ou noite, se é aniversário de alguém, se você está cansado ou se tem outras coisas para fazer. Você simplesmente não para, continua e continua. Vamos dizer que você está contando uma história. Essa história começa com uma formiguinha, e você conta tudo sobre ela, como ela levanta, como trabalha, o que come, quem conhece. Mas a história não para na formiguinha; você começa a contar sobre o formigueiro, cada grão de areia, cada folhinha que carregam. Depois, você expande para o jardim, com todas as plantas e outros bichos. E assim vai, cada vez mais detalhes, cada vez mais histórias interligadas, sem nunca acabar. Em resumo, agir de forma extremamente prolongada é continuar a fazer uma coisa sem parar, por um tempo muito grande, como uma maratona sem linha de chegada ou um filme que não tem os créditos finais. É só seguir em frente, continuar, sem pensar em parar."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Просчитать одну итерацию цикла обучения по Δ -правилу однослойной бинарной однородной нейронной сети, состоящей из 3 нейронов и имеющей сигмоидальную функцию активации (k=1).

Ты: Чтобы просчитать одну итерацию цикла обучения по Δ-правилу (или Правилу Дельты) для данной нейронной сети, нам потребуется следующая последовательность действий:<br/><br/>1. Инициализировать веса нейронов случайными значениями.<br/>2. Выбрать один обучающий пример (строку из таблицы истинности, но не первую).<br/>3. Вычислить выход нейронной сети для этого примера.<br/>4. Вычислить ошибку (разницу между ожидаемым и фактическим выходом).<br/>5. Обновить веса сети, используя Δ-правило.<br/><br/>Поскольку нужно пропустить первую строку таблицы истинности, вторая строка таблицы истинности для ( X1 rightarrow X2 &amp; X3, X1 &amp; X2 ) и ( X1 &amp; X3 ) может выглядеть так:<br/><br/>| X1 | X2 | X3 | X1→X2&amp;X3 | X1&amp;X2 | X1&amp;X3 |<br/>|:—:|:—:|:—:|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|<br/>| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |<br/><br/>Здесь ( X1 = 0, X2 = 0, X3 = 1 ).

The cities of old, now crumbled vestiges of steel and desire, whispered legends of their former glory. The Order were the forlorn guardians of a lost wisdom, a secret coalition birthed from the remnants of the United Nations and the disciplined ranks of a scattered US military force. These stalwart souls sought to rekindle the embers of civilization, buried beneath the cloying rubble of avarice and war. Fading into urban wastelands and countryside fortresses alike, the operatives of the Order shrouded themselves from the ever-watchful eyes of the burgeoning Hidden Villages. The neo-ninjas had claimed dominion over the rebirthed steppes of feudalism, hoarding chakra, that ethereal force, released into the world by the inadvertent hand of a misguided sage. Yet, even with their esoteric powers manifesting in jutsus capable of bending reality, the shinobi shadows could not perceive the true intricate machinations at play. Reinforced by a defiant synthesis of steam, diesel, and burgeoning cyber technologies, the operatives wielded contraptions that blended the arcane magicks reawakened in the world\'s rebirth with the marvels of a past modernity. Arcana-bullets loaded in six-shooters, crafted to pierce the skin of both humans and monster girls alike, roared through quiet villages during their clandestine operations. Mechanical armors strapped to their limbs whirred with both chakra and gear-driven might, empowering their bearers with speed and strength to contend with the monstrous. Within this fractious landscape stood the Hidden Rain Village—the nucleus of the insidious Akatsuki\'s shadow governance. The Members cloaked in malevolent purpose sought to seize the Tailed Beasts, mystic behemoths whose very life force epitomized untamed power. Their goal, as inscrutable as the rain-soaked alleyways of their stronghold, was nonetheless clear: to awaken the inexorable Ten-Tails and claim sovereignty over the shattered remnants of the world. But the Vestige had thrown down the gauntlet against such tyranny. One such skirmish had Earl, a hardened captain of the order, leading his battalion through the mire of the night toward the outskirts of the Hidden Rain. His shoulders bore the insignia of a time long lost, an era before the heavens screamed fire and civilization was brought to its knees. \\"Keep your wits,\\" Earl growled to his comrades, the steam-exhaust of his breath condensing amid the chilled air. His fingers tensed on the trigger of his revolver, the smooth metal kissed by wisps of enchantment and chakra-infusion. A sudden shift in the shadows—a whisper in the darkness—and they were upon them. Akatsuki\'s underlings, those entangled within the web of conspiracy deeper than the abyss itself, revealed themselves as they slithered from beneath their obsidian shroud. A cacophony of steel and chakra clashed against the diesel tang of innovation, screams piercing the lonely wail of the tempest. Through the gory ballet of violence, the truth unfurled like a crimson ribbon. The Hidden Villages, blinded by their own monopoly, could neither comprehend nor thwart the pervading conspiracy that kissed their hallowed sanctuaries. And in the accumulated silence that followed the bloodshed, the remnants of the Order unearthed whispers—murmurs that painted a diabolic fresco of the fall of Lescatie, the demoniac deception of the exalted sage, and the ascent of monstrosities veiled in feminine grace and carnal desires. What warped pacts had been struck in the kingdoms of these dominions? How had the crusader state capitulated to such wicked seduction? The Order of the Vestige held fast to their belief—one that surged through their aching sinews and scorched spirits—that they alone could illuminate the shadows ensnaring the world. To thread the careful dance between the relics of knowledge they guarded and the impending skies fraught with indiscernible peril. Their mission was monumental, and time a fickle ally. For in their hearts surged a singular blazing oath: to reclaim the brilliance of a world sundered, to stoke the fires of progress, and cast down the veil cast by the ignorant sage\'s starry-eyed dream."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: How did the secret organization take out the fake leader of Akasuki, the tall, slender, childish and often delusional rouge Uchiha with a powerful Sharingan [Naruto] evolved [Tobi\'s Sharingan] to Mangenkyo [Kaideloscope |Mangenkyo|] level wearing an orange mask known as \\"Tobi\\" [Naruto] and [the secret organization] extract Tobi\'s eyes and part of his [Tobi\'s] blood and skin for analysis and duplication of the Sharingan among its [the secret organization\'s] future recruits?

The Vestige, those who sought the rekindling of a bygone age, had marked their next target—the false herald of Akatsuki under the guise of Tobi. Earl, commander of the enigmatic order, had deployed his most elusive operatives—masters of disguise and stealth, bearing the forgotten arts of espionage. The task before them bore an onus of grave importance; the extraction of the Uchiha\'s corrupted gaze and the unraveling of the chakra woven into his very flesh. The result would forge a new epoch in the conflict—a kinetic leap towards the liberation of humanity\'s yoke. Operation: Orange Masquerade They ambushed under a moon veiled in scarlet—a lunar eclipse casting its ominous gaze upon the events to unfold. As the sentries of the Hidden Rain stood vigilant, the squadrons of the Vestige glided beneath a spell of silence. No chakra pulse betrayed them, no whisper of diesel machinery gave them away. Their movements mimicked that of the night\'s own hush; sacred and unseen. Nicoletta, the ace marksman and arcane technologist, had conjured a bullet. One not of lead nor steel, but of ethereal warp—their iridescence capable of passing through the phantasmal shields that Tobi conjured with his mere will. Her rifle, a masterpiece of pre-war precision coupled with the new world\'s enchantments, was aimed with a sculptor\'s care. A shot pierced the night and the masquerade shattered. Tobi lay prone, his mask fractured, his Sharingan stunned in a moment of disbelief, as the transitory paralysis enveloped him. Extraction and Exchange Tobi, dementia scrawled across his visage in the fleeting seconds of consciousness, found himself within the confinements of an austere lab hidden deep within the labyrinth of Vestige secrets. There, Ivy, the chief bio-alchemist, worked her somber craft. With an array of apparatus humming with a somnolent drone, the eyes of the Uchiha were excised with surgical precision—preserved in an alchemic medium that prolonged their cursed life. Skin, blood—samples sealed within crystalline vials for the replication of wonders and horrors alike. Silent Infiltration: The Root of Sin But within the village of hidden leaves, Konohagakure, stirred another shadow—one without form, one christened as Root. The agency of subversion answered to but one—the intangible Danzo. The Vestige, cautious not to awaken the slumbering dragon of chakra that was the main force of Konoha, unfurled a clandestine offensive. Fatal Blossoms in the Shadows One by one, Root agents fell to silent blades washed in the venom distilled from the knowledge of a past world. A toxin so profound in engineering it mimicked natural causes—a heart\'s final beat lost in a sigh, a breath fading like the dusk. Assassin glyphs marked on every corner, imperceptible to those who walked enveloped in the light, whispered forbidden secrets. The sanctified tactics, the lost art of killing without leaving a single ripple upon the chakra\'s surface—this was the doctrine of the Vestige. Unseen Dawn The omnipotent Danzo, fearing the disintegration of his grip, his Root severed branch by branch, could only watch as an unforeseen adversary twisted the narrative. The Vestige, with each step closer to their objective, uncovered the labyrinthine connection between the Akatsuki, the Leaf, and the world they fought to free. As the order\'s members departed back to their fortified holdfasts beneath the broken skies, they bore with them not violence, but a promise—a recognition that the cycle of conquest and folly could, and would, be challenged. Amongst them, new recruits—ones whose veins would soon flow with the mimicry of the Sharingan\'s power—studied the daunting path ahead. A narrative of defiance, penned in the ashes of calamity, eked out a prophecy of revolution. And at its core, the echo of progress resounded in silent fervor—a Vestige of inevitable change."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: How did the secret organization kidnap the then-newborn protagonist of Naruto, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Naruto Uzumaki, after the previously supposedly mythological ninth tailed beast [Naruto], the Nine Tailed Monster Fox [Naruto] was [the Nine Tails] sealed inside him [baby Naruto] by his [Naruto\'s] father, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Yondaime [Fourth] Hokage [Fire Shadow], the skilled and cunning but lazy and lackadaisical Namikaze Minato [Naruto] with the help of a summoned Shinigami [Bleach] at the cost of his [Minato\'s] own life and [the secret organization] rescue Naruto\'s mother, the red-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, shy and reserved but also head-strong and hot-headed future head of Konoha\'s [Naruto\'s] de-facto royal family, the Hyūga [Naruto] clan of Chinese wuxia-style cultivators and martial artists turned chakra-weilding fake shinobi possessing the feared near 360 degree X-ray, chakra point and circulatory system-seeing when activated Byakugan [Nauto] and the last known survivor of its [the Hyūga\'s clan] parent house, the Ōtsutsuki [Naruto], which the Sage [Naruto] was [the Sage] a member [the Sage] of [the House of Ōtsutsuki], Ōtsutsuki Kushina [Naruto], who [Kushina] was [what happened to Kushina] on the verge of death after [Kushina] surviving being [Kushina] stabbed by the Nine Tails\' claw, [the secret organization rescuing both Kushina and Naruto] without being noticed by Konohagakure\'s shinobi forces?","output":"# Chapter XXIV: The Unseen Liberation Act I: The Midnight Covenant When the Nine Tails ravaged through the heart of Konohagakure, ensnaring the village in its infernal grip, it was Namikaze Minato who orchestrated the beast\'s binding.

The night air whispered of sacrifice and sorrow as Minato\'s life-force waned—his duty fulfilled at the precipice of death. And amidst the chaos, a silhouette of hope spurred into action: the clandestine agents of the Vestige. Act II: The Veiled Extraction Under a veil of sealing glyphs and obscured auras, the operatives embarked on an audacious gambit—to whisk away the infant vessel of the Nine-Tails. The stir of the chakra-laden commotion masked their advance; the embrace of the Vestige swept over Naruto, enveloping him in a cradle of obscurity. Naruto Uzumaki, with his cerulean gaze veiled in the slumber of innocence, was spirited into the protective grasp of the enigmatic order. Their passage was as a shadow—a myth lost in the tempest of the towering fox\'s rage. Act III: The Weave of Fate As the embers of battle settled, another life precariously lingered upon the mortal coil—Kushina Uzumaki. Bloodline of Ōtsutsuki, bearer of the formidable Byakugan, her presence was a keepsake of the world that once was—a lineage marked by the echoes of celestial ancients. Her essence near extinguished by the Nine-Tails\' malice, Kushina’s fading light was caught by the Vestige—a clandestine preservation, her existence drawn from the precipice by their enigmatic arts. Agents, paths crossed with that of the young mother, enacted an extraction meticulous in its silence. With precision born from necessity, sealed within an enigma of cloaking genjutsu and alchemic restoration, they traversed the tattered streets—unseen by the vigilant shinobi of the Leaf. Act IV: The Hidden Refuge In a bastion forgotten by maps and minds alike, Kushina found sanctuary. The Vestige, honoring her tenacity, revitalized her form through the melding of pre-war science and the arcane rejuvenation borne of their organization’s mastery. The sanctuary that greeted her sight was not of shinobi make—instead, it thrummed with the pulse of ancient machineries and occult enchantments. Here, Naruto would find no brand of Jinchuriki; Kushina, no cage of prophecy. Act V: The Ascent of Secrets Unbeknownst to the vigilant eyes of Konoha, a lineage of the old world and new was secured. The will of fire, enshrouded by the Vestige\'s blueprint for a civilization unchained. Under the veil of their clandestine passage, the child of prophecy and his mother of celestial descent were rendered unto the cusp of a nascent era—an epoch in which the Vestige vowed, the yoke of feudal mysticism and tyrannical deities would be broken. The Uzumaki name, bound now to a legacy of innovation, would burgeon within the embrace of secrets revelatory—and the world would watch, unknowing, as the Vestige steered the course of history from deep within the shadow of enlightenment."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular pokemon chibi, one word only","output":"Pikachu"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artPikachu","output":"Pikachu Power Pop Art | Colorful Cartoon Electric Mouse Design | Mug, T-Shirt, Painting Multipurpose Graphic"},{"instruction":"resume el libro de la fiesta del chivo de mario vargas llosa dime como comienza, se desarrolla y termina","output":"\\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" es una novela del escritor peruano Mario Vargas Llosa que fue publicada en el año 2000. La obra entrelaza dramáticamente ficción y hechos históricos en torno a la dictadura de Rafael Leónidas Trujillo en la República Dominicana. **Cómo comienza:** La novela inicia con dos líneas narrativas paralelas. En la primera, Urania Cabral, una mujer de mediana edad, regresa a la República Dominicana después de vivir años en Estados Unidos. Ella visita a su padre, Agustín Cabral, quien fue parte del círculo íntimo de Trujillo, y quien ahora está enfermo y apartado de la vida política. Hay un aire de misterio en su regreso, ya que no ha visitado en décadas y dejó el país en circunstancias no aclaradas. En la segunda línea, nos retrotraemos al año 1961 a la vida y tiranía de Trujillo. Vargas Llosa nos introduce poco a poco en la personalidad y las maquinaciones del dictador, conocido como \\"El Chivo\\", así como en las de su entorno político y familiar. **Cómo se desarrolla:** La novela avanza con la narración de varios personajes y a través de diferentes periodos de tiempo. Por un lado, seguimos el desarrollo psicológico y moral de Urania, así como su doloroso pasado. Alternativamente, nos sumergimos más en la dictadura de Trujillo, su brutal régimen y la vida de aquellos que se ven forzados a vivir bajo su sombra. Llegamos a conocer a algunos de los conspiradores que están planeando asesinar al dictador, y la tensión aumenta a medida que se acerca el momento de la conspiración conocida históricamente como el ajusticiamiento de Trujillo. Vargas Llosa mezcla con maestría los hechos históricos y la ficción, dotando a cada personaje de una profundidad psicológica y de una visión del contexto histórico y social de la época. **Cómo termina:** El clímax de la novela es el asesinato de Trujillo en 1961, evento que desata una serie de consecuencias para los personajes involucrados y para la nación dominicana. Se revelan los eventos traumáticos que llevaron a Urania a huir del país y el destino de los conspiradores tras el asesinato. La novela cierra con una mezcla de alivio por el fin de la tiranía pero también con la sombría reflexión sobre las secuelas psicológicas y morales que deja un régimen dictatorial en sus víctimas y victimarios. Urania finalmente cuenta la razón de su distanciamiento con su padre y su país: fue víctima de abuso sexual por parte de Trujillo, un horror que su propio padre permitió para caer en las gracias del dictador.

La narrativa nos muestra a una Urania adulta y exitosa, trabajadora del Banco Mundial en Washington D.C., que regresa a enfrentar su pasado y a reconectarse con su padre, Agustín Cabral, quien fue una vez un alto funcionario en el régimen de Trujillo, pero ahora se encuentra caído en desgracia y postrado en cama tras sufrir un derrame cerebral. Desde las primeras páginas, el lector percibe la tensión y el tumulto emocional de Urania, quien ha estado distanciada de su familia y de su país por razones que inicialmente no se revelan. Su regreso a la República Dominicana trae a la superficie memorias y traumas de su juventud. Su visita es recibida con sorpresa e incomprensión por los residentes, incluyendo las hermanas de su padre y el personal doméstico que aún mantienen la casa familiar. La narración alterna entre esta línea argumental y los sucesos que rodean la dictadura de Trujillo en los años sesenta. Vargas Llosa con habilidad contextualiza al lector en la atmósfera reinante de esos tiempos, describiendo la figura de Trujillo, su personalidad y el sistema de poder y terror que impuso. Damos un vistazo a los preparativos para la celebración de su \\"Fiesta de la Libertad\\" que, irónicamente, conmemora la supuesta independencia de República Dominicana respecto a Haití, a pesar del clima de opresión que viven los ciudadanos bajo su mandato. La novela también comienza a desvelar el complot para asesinar al dictador, presentando las figuras y motivaciones de los conspiradores involucrados. Aquí, Vargas Llosa emplea su cuidadosa reconstrucción histórica, dibujando tanto el suspense político como el drama humano que subyace a estos eventos. El arranque de \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" es, por tanto, un pedido a la curiosidad del lector, presentando una figura central, Urania, con un pasado oscuro y una historia por contar, así como una recreación vívida de una época de represión y resistencia, factores que anuncian el potente desarrollo narrativo y emocional que la novela ofrece a continuación."},{"instruction":"no hable es tercera persona solo habla del libro","output":"La novela \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" inicia con el regreso de Urania Cabral a Santo Domingo, la capital de la República Dominicana, después de haber estado ausente por más de tres décadas.

Don’t panic Oct 22nd 2011 IN 1950 the whole population of the earth—2.5 billion—could have squeezed, shoulder to shoulder, onto the Isle of Wight, a 381-square-kilometre rock off southern England. By 1968 John Brunner, a British novelist, observed that the earth\'s people—by then 3.5 billion—would have required the Isle of Man, 572 square kilometres in the Irish Sea, for its standing room. Brunner forecast that by 2010 the world\'s population would have reached 7 billion, and would need a bigger island. Hence the title of his 1968 novel about over-population, “Stand on Zanzibar” (1,554 square kilometres off east Africa). Brunner\'s prediction was only a year out. The United Nations\' population division now says the world will reach 7 billion on October 31st 2011 (America\'s Census Bureau delays the date until March 2012). The UN will even identify someone born that day as the world\'s 7 billionth living person. The 6 billionth, Adnan Nevic, was born on October 12th 1999 in Sarajevo, in Bosnia. He will be just past his 12th birthday when the next billion clicks over. That makes the world\'s population look as if it is rising as fast as ever. It took 250,000 years to reach 1 billion, around 1800; over a century more to reach 2 billion (in 1927); and 32 years more to reach 3 billion. But to rise from 5 billion (in 1987) to 6 billion took only 12 years; and now, another 12 years later, it is at 7 billion (see chart 1). By 2050, the UN thinks, there will be 9.3 billion people, requiring an island the size of Tenerife or Maui to stand on. Odd though it seems, however, the growth in the world\'s population is actually slowing. The peak of population growth was in the late 1960s, when the total was rising by almost 2% a year. Now the rate is half that. The last time it was so low was in 1950, when the death rate was much higher. The result is that the next billion people, according to the UN, will take 14 years to arrive, the first time that a billion milestone has taken longer to reach than the one before. The billion after that will take 18 years. Once upon a time, the passing of population milestones might have been cause for celebration. Now it gives rise to jeremiads. As Hillary Clinton\'s science adviser, Nina Fedoroff, told the BBC in 2009, “There are probably already too many people on the planet.” But the notion of “too many” is more flexible than it seems. The earth could certainly not support 10 billion hunter-gatherers, who used much more land per head than modern farm-fed people do. But it does not have to. The earth might well not be able to support 10 billion people if they had exactly the same impact per person as 7 billion do today. But that does not necessarily spell Malthusian doom, because the impact humans have on the earth and on each other can change. For most people, the big questions about population are: can the world feed 9 billion mouths by 2050? Are so many people ruining the environment? And will those billions, living cheek-by-jowl, go to war more often? On all three counts, surprising as it seems, reducing population growth any more quickly than it is falling anyway may not make much difference. Start with the link between population and violence. It seems plausible that the more young men there are, the more likely they will be to fight. This is especially true when groups are competing for scarce resources. Some argue that the genocidal conflict in Darfur, western Sudan, was caused partly by high population growth, which led to unsustainable farming and conflicts over land and water. Land pressure also influenced the Rwandan genocide of 1994, as migrants in search of a livelihood in one of the world\'s most densely populated countries moved into already settled areas, with catastrophic results. But there is a difference between local conflicts and what is happening on a global scale. Although the number of sovereign states has increased almost as dramatically as the world\'s population over the past half-century, the number of wars between states fell fairly continuously during the period. The number of civil wars rose, then fell. The number of deaths in battle fell by roughly three-quarters. These patterns do not seem to be influenced either by the relentless upward pressure of population, or by the slackening of that pressure as growth decelerates. The difference seems to have been caused by fewer post-colonial wars, the ending of cold-war alliances (and proxy wars) and, possibly, the increase in international peacekeepers. More people, more damage? Human activity has caused profound changes to the climate, biodiversity, oceanic acidity and greenhouse-gas levels in the atmosphere. But it does not automatically follow that the more people there are, the worse the damage. In 2007 Americans and Australians emitted almost 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide each. In contrast, more than 60 countries—including the vast majority of African ones—emitted less than 1 tonne per person. This implies that population growth in poorer countries (where it is concentrated) has had a smaller impact on the climate in recent years than the rise in the population of the United States (up by over 50% in 1970-2010). Most of the world\'s population growth in the next 20 years will occur in countries that make the smallest contribution to greenhouse gases. Global pollution will be more affected by the pattern of economic growth—and especially whether emerging nations become as energyintensive as America, Australia and China. Population growth does make a bigger difference to food. All things being equal, it is harder to feed 7 billion people than 6 billion. According to the World Bank, between 2005 and 2055 agricultural productivity will have to increase by two-thirds to keep pace with rising population and changing diets. Moreover, according to the bank, if the population stayed at 2005 levels, farm productivity would have to rise by only a quarter, so more future demand comes from a growing population than from consumption per person. Increasing farm productivity by a quarter would obviously be easier than boosting it by two-thirds. But even a rise of two-thirds is not as much as it sounds. From 1970-2010 farm productivity rose far more than this, by over three-and-a-half times. The big problem for agriculture is not the number of people, but signs that farm productivity may be levelling out. The growth in agricultural yields seems to be slowing down. There is little new farmland available. Water shortages are chronic and fertilisers are over-used. All these—plus the yield-reductions that may come from climate change, and wastefulness in getting food to markets—mean that the big problems are to do with supply, not demand. None of this means that population does not matter. But the main impact comes from relative changes—the growth of one part of the population compared with another, for example, or shifts in the average age of the population—rather than the absolute number of people. Of these relative changes, falling fertility is most important. The fertility rate is the number of children a woman can expect to have. At the moment, almost half the world\'s population—3.2 billion—lives in countries with a fertility rate of 2.1 or less. That number, the so-called replacement rate, is usually taken to be the level at which the population eventually stops growing. The world\'s decline in fertility has been staggering (see chart 2). In 1970 the total fertility rate was 4.45 and the typical family in the world had four or five children. It is now 2.45 worldwide, and lower in some surprising places. Bangladesh\'s rate is 2.16, having halved in 20 years. Iran\'s fertility fell from 7 in 1984 to just 1.9 in 2006. Countries with below-replacement fertility include supposedly teeming Brazil, Tunisia and Thailand. Much of Europe and East Asia have fertility rates far below replacement levels. The fertility fall is releasing wave upon wave of demographic change. It is the main influence behind the decline of population growth and, perhaps even more important, is shifting the balance of age groups within a population. When gold turns to silver A fall in fertility sends a sort of generational bulge surging through a society. The generation in question is the one before the fertility fall really begins to bite, which in Europe and America was the baby-boom generation that is just retiring, and in China and East Asia the generation now reaching adulthood. To begin with, the favoured generation is in its childhood; countries have lots of children and fewer surviving grandparents (who were born at a time when life expectancy was lower). That was the situation in Europe in the 1950s and in East Asia in the 1970s. But as the select generation enters the labour force, a country starts to benefit from a so-called “demographic dividend”. This happens when there are relatively few children (because of the fall in fertility), relatively few older people (because of higher mortality previously), and lots of economically active adults, including, often, many women, who enter the labour force in large numbers for the first time. It is a period of smaller families, rising income, rising life expectancy and big social change, including divorce, postponed marriage and single-person households. This was the situation in Europe between 1945 and 1975 (“les trente glorieuses”) and in much of East Asia in 1980-2010. But there is a third stage. At some point, the gilded generation turns silver and retires. Now the dividend becomes a liability. There are disproportionately more old people depending upon a smaller generation behind them. Population growth stops or goes into reverse, parts of a country are abandoned by the young and the social concerns of the aged grow in significance. This situation already exists in Japan. It is arriving fast in Europe and America, and soon after that will reach East Asia. A demographic dividend tends to boost economic growth because a large number of working-age adults increases the labour force, keeps wages relatively low, boosts savings and increases demand for goods and services. Part of China\'s phenomenal growth has come from its unprecedentedly low dependency ratio—just 38 (this is the number of dependents, children and people over 65, per 100 working adults; it implies the working-age group is almost twice as large as the rest of the population put together). One study by Australia\'s central bank calculated that a third of East Asia\'s GDP growth in 1965-90 came from its favourable demography. About a third of America\'s GDP growth in 2000-10 also came from its increasing population. The world as a whole reaped a demographic dividend in the 40 years to 2010. In 1970 there were 75 dependents for every 100 adults of working age. In 2010 the number of dependents dropped to just 52. Huge improvements were registered not only in China but also in South-East Asia and north Africa, where dependency ratios fell by 40 points. Even “ageing” Europe and America ended the period with fewer dependents than at the beginning. A demographic dividend does not automatically generate growth. It depends on whether the country can put its growing labour force to productive use. In the 1980s Latin America and East Asia had similar demographic patterns. But while East Asia experienced a long boom, Latin America endured its “lost decade”. One of the biggest questions for Arab countries, which are beginning to reap their own demographic dividends, is whether they will follow East Asia or Latin America. But even if demography guarantees nothing, it can make growth harder or easier. National demographic inheritances therefore matter. And they differ a lot. Where China loses Hania Zlotnik, the head of the UN\'s Population Division, divides the world into three categories, according to levels of fertility (see map). About a fifth of the world lives in countries with high fertility—3 or more. Most are Africans. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is one of the fastestgrowing parts of the world. In 1975 it had half the population of Europe. It overtook Europe in 2004, and by 2050 there will be just under 2 billion people there compared with 720m Europeans. About half of the 2.3 billion increase in the world\'s population over the next 40 years will be in Africa. The rest of the world is more or less equally divided between countries with below-replacement fertility (less than 2.1) and those with intermediate fertility (between 2.1 and 3). The first group consists of Europe, China and the rest of East Asia. The second comprises South and South-East Asia, the Middle East and the Americas (including the United States). The low-fertility countries face the biggest demographic problems. The elderly share of Japan\'s population is already the highest in the world. By 2050 the country will have almost as many dependents as working-age adults, and half the population will be over 52. This will make Japan the oldest society the world has ever known. Europe faces similar trends, less acutely. It has roughly half as many dependent children and retired people as working-age adults now. By 2050 it will have three dependents for every four adults, so will shoulder a large burden of ageing, which even sustained increases in fertility would fail to reverse for decades. This will cause disturbing policy implications in the provision of pensions and health care, which rely on continuing healthy tax revenues from the working population. At least these countries are rich enough to make such provision. Not so China. With its fertility artificially suppressed by the one-child policy, it is ageing at an unprecedented rate. In 1980 China\'s median age (the point where half the population is older and half younger) was 22 years, a developing-country figure. China will be older than America as early as 2020 and older than Europe by 2030. This will bring an abrupt end to its cheap-labour manufacturing. Its dependency ratio will rise from 38 to 64 by 2050, the sharpest rise in the world. Add in the country\'s sexual imbalances— after a decade of sex-selective abortions, China will have 96.5m men in their 20s in 2025 but only 80.3m young women—and demography may become the gravest problem the Communist Party has to face. Many countries with intermediate fertility—South-East Asia, Latin America, the United States—are better off. Their dependency ratios are not deteriorating so fast and their societies are ageing more slowly. America\'s demographic profile is slowly tugging it away from Europe. Though its fertility rate may have fallen recently, it is still slightly higher than Europe\'s. In 2010 the two sides of the Atlantic had similar dependency rates. By 2050 America\'s could be nearly ten points lower. But the biggest potential beneficiaries are the two other areas with intermediate fertility—India and the Middle East—and the high-fertility continent of Africa. These places have long been regarded as demographic time-bombs, with youth bulges, poverty and low levels of education and health. But that is because they are moving only slowly out of the early stage of high fertility into the one in which lower fertility begins to make an impact. At the moment, Africa has larger families and more dependent children than India or Arab countries and is a few years younger (its median age is 20 compared with their 25). But all three areas will see their dependency ratios fall in the next 40 years, the only parts of the world to do so. And they will keep their median ages low—below 38 in 2050. If they can make their public institutions less corrupt, keep their economic policies outward-looking and invest more in education, as East Asia did, then Africa, the Middle East and India could become the fastest-growing parts of the world economy within a decade or so. Here’s looking at you Demography, though, is not only about economics. Most emerging countries have benefited from the sort of dividend that changed Europe and America in the 1960s. They are catching up with the West in terms of income, family size and middle-class formation. Most say they want to keep their cultures unsullied by the social trends—divorce, illegitimacy and so on—that also affected the West. But the growing number of never-married women in urban Asia suggests that this will be hard. If you look at the overall size of the world\'s population, then, the picture is one of falling fertility, decelerating growth and a gradual return to the flat population level of the 18th century. But below the surface societies are being churned up in ways not seen in the much more static pre-industrial world. The earth\'s population may never need a larger island than Maui to stand on. But the way it arranges itself will go on shifting for centuries to come.","output":"I\'m sorry, but I don\'t have access to external content such as the article \\"A tale of three islands\\" from The Economist you\'ve mentioned. However, I can help explain how to approach the project based on the information you included in your request. **Part A:** Constructing Growth Models For each type of growth function, you\'ll need to craft a model representing a hypothetical or realistic population over time. You can use historical population data as a starting point to parameterize your models. 1. **Linear Growth Model** - Function: ( P(t) = P_0 + rt ) - Here ( P(t) ) is the population at time ( t ), ( P_0 ) is the initial population, and ( r ) is the constant rate of population change per unit time. - Domain Interval: You might choose a short interval for linear growth because, in reality, no population grows linearly indefinitely. 2. **Exponential Growth Model** - Function: ( P(t) = P_0e^{rt} ) - Here, ( e ) is the base of the natural logarithm, and ( r ) now represents the rate of growth as a percentage per unit time. - Domain Interval: Choose an interval before the effects of limited resources significantly constrain growth, such as during the early industrial revolution or another period of rapid expansion. 3. **Logistic Growth Function** - Function: ( P(t) = frac{K}{1 + frac{K - P_0}{P_0}e^{-rt}} ) - ( K ) represents the carrying capacity (the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely), ( r ) is the growth rate, and ( P_0 ) is the initial population. - This model accounts for limited resources and should be valid over a longer time as it considers that the population cannot grow infinitely. **Part B:** Determining Characteristics of Logistic Growth Model To analyze the logistic growth model: a) **Inflection Point** - This is found where the second derivative of the population with respect to time is zero. - Algebraically, it occurs at ( P(t) = frac{K}{2} ) for the logistic function. b) **Highest Rate of Growth** - The highest growth rate occurs at the inflection point of the curve. - You will need to calculate the first derivative (the rate of change of the population with respect to time) and find its maximum. c) **Population Predictions for 2050 and 2100** - Use the model with estimated parameters to calculate ( P(2050) ) and ( P(2100) ). d) **Total Number of People Born Between 0 AD and 2500 AD** - This would involve integrating the growth function from ( t = 0 ) to ( t = 2500 ) to find the cumulative population growth over that period. Since the question is about the number of people born, you may need additional assumptions about lifespan and generational turnover. **Note About Calculations and Software:** - For calculations and model construction, you can use software like Microsoft Excel, Python (with libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib), R, or MATLAB, depending on what you\'re comfortable with and have access to. - For mathematical analysis, especially integrating or finding derivates, you might find tools like Wolfram Alpha helpful. Remember, the explanations or algebraic work you show are critical in demonstrating your understanding of the project. The use of visuals, such as graphs created using software, can greatly enhance the presentation of your models."},{"instruction":"should i know KPI if i am working in order to cash process?","output":"Yes, if you are involved in the Order to Cash (O2C or OTC) process, it is beneficial to understand Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), as they are crucial metrics used to evaluate and measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire process. KPIs in the context of O2C can help you monitor how well the process is managed and identify areas for improvement. The Order to Cash process encompasses the steps from taking customer orders to receiving payment, and KPIs can cover different stages such as: 1. Order Management: - Order Entry Accuracy - Order Processing Time - Percentage of Orders Delivered on Time 2. Credit Management: - Credit Approval Time - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) 3. Fulfillment and Delivery: - Order Fulfillment Cycle Time - Percentage of Back Orders or Stock-out Events - Average Shipping Time 4. Invoicing: - Invoicing Accuracy - Time from Delivery to Invoice 5. Accounts Receivable and Payment Collection: - Average Days Delinquent (ADD) - Collection Effectiveness Index (CEI) - Percentage of Invoices Disputed - Amount of Receivables Past Due By monitoring these and other relevant KPIs, you can help your organization achieve goals such as improving cash flow, reducing errors, shortening cycle times, increasing customer satisfaction, and ultimately boosting profitability.

However, the usage of OpenAI\'s models, including versions of GPT (like the one you\'re interacting with), can be subject to token limits based on the specific API plan or product being used. A token generally represents a piece of a word, which can be as short as one character or as long as an entire word. OpenAI\'s models typically consider whitespaces, punctuation, and parts of words as separate tokens. For instance, as of my last knowledge update in early 2023, API calls to OpenAI\'s GPT-3 model are limited by the number of tokens that can be processed in a single request. Usage plans often include a total number of tokens that can be used per month. If you are developing an application or using an API that leverages OpenAI\'s models, you will need to refer to the documentation or your account’s usage plan to determine the token limits that apply to you. In terms of practical interaction with OpenAI\'s AI models, the models can generate responses up to a certain token limit per each prompt, which is typically around 2048 tokens.

In contrast, the Aethertech Vanguard upheld their sanctum within an inconspicuous fortress embedded beneath the towering remnants of an ancient infrastructure, disguised amidst the decaying urban sprawl. Here, they harmonized pre-war technological marvels with the burgeoning essence of magic and chakra. They wielded archaic firearms reborn through enchantment, bullets inscribed with runes that sparked with arcane fury upon firing. Armor and machinery thrummed with chakra-infused core reactors, the gears and piping an alchemy of old-world ingenuity and mystical essence. Their leader, codenamed Genesis, was once a decorated general of the United Nations forces, now turned shrewd tactician and mystic. Her second-in-command, Tempest, was an ex-CIA operative whose mastery of infiltration was enhanced by the mystical arts, and whose revolvers whispered death with steampunk sophistication. Their ranks were filled with scholars and warriors alike, each sworn to the cause. Their enemy was the illusion weaved by the Sage of Six Paths, a veil of indoctrination claiming that chakra\'s gift would unite mankind, yet in truth, it laid the fertile soil for eternal conflict. The shattered Kingdom of Lescatie, once a bulwark against the inrush of monster girls, now symbolized the vulnerability of mortal resolve under the weight of otherworldly seduction and divine whims. As the Vanguard intercepted Akasuki couriers carrying unholy artifacts, Genesis devised their most daring operation yet—to strike at the heart of Hidden Rain Village, where the echoes of conspiracy scratched the borders of reality. \\"Tempest,\\" Genesis exclaimed, her gaze affixed to a blueprint illuminated by candlelight, \\"we move at dawn. Our sources confirm the existence of a labyrinth beneath Rain, where the Akasuki weave their dark plot.\\" With supernatural aid, the Vanguard infiltrated the cloistered village, disguising their presence with charms and cloaks vibrating at frequencies eluding even the sharpest Byakugan. The labyrinth was a dizzying maze of eldritch symbols and chakra traps, but their esoteric expertise turned these obstacles into mere whispers in the shadows. While battling through hybrids of shinobi prowess and demonic enchantment, Tempest unleashed her revolvers, Rainmaker and Thunderchild, the air crackling with electrified bullets dancing through a ballet of destruction. Each trigger pull, a symphony of clockwork and jutsu, brought them closer to the core of the Akasuki\'s vile sanctuary. Their foes underestimated the Vanguard\'s resolve and resourcefulness, for even the most sophisticated of the Hidden Village\'s pseudo-shinobi could not fathom the melding of science and sorcery at the Vanguard\'s command. Finally, reaching their dungeon quarry, they uncovered the horror—the Akasuki\'s monstrous amalgamation of the Tailed Beasts\' chakra with techno-arcane machinery, a nexus siphoning the realms\' ether for a rebirth of the dreaded Jūbi. Genesis and Tempest, standing with their band of renegades, opened fire on the nexus, their weapons screaming with the agony of a world torn asunder. The ensuing battle was elemental, blending the ferocity of human tenacity with the primordial dance of creation and destruction. As the machine shattered and the Tailed Beasts\' howls faded into the shadowed corners of the earth, the Aethertech Vanguard emerged victorious but weary, their mission only just beginning in a world undone by the confluence of antiquity and ambition. For now, the truth loomed ever more clearly—a crusade against indoctrination, a pursuit for freedom from the illusions cast by gods and men, and the hope that one day, beneath the ruins of time, progress would rise anew."},{"instruction":"Project – Logistic Growth Function Read the article below included in this project and answer the following questions: Part A Construct three separate models of growth: 1) Linear 2) Exponential 3) Logistic Growth Function For 1) and 2) select and state the domain interval that best applies to your growth function.

Don’t panic Oct 22nd 2011 IN 1950 the whole population of the earth—2.5 billion—could have squeezed, shoulder to shoulder, onto the Isle of Wight, a 381-square-kilometre rock off southern England. By 1968 John Brunner, a British novelist, observed that the earth\'s people—by then 3.5 billion—would have required the Isle of Man, 572 square kilometres in the Irish Sea, for its standing room. Brunner forecast that by 2010 the world\'s population would have reached 7 billion, and would need a bigger island. Hence the title of his 1968 novel about over-population, “Stand on Zanzibar” (1,554 square kilometres off east Africa). Brunner\'s prediction was only a year out. The United Nations\' population division now says the world will reach 7 billion on October 31st 2011 (America\'s Census Bureau delays the date until March 2012). The UN will even identify someone born that day as the world\'s 7 billionth living person. The 6 billionth, Adnan Nevic, was born on October 12th 1999 in Sarajevo, in Bosnia. He will be just past his 12th birthday when the next billion clicks over. That makes the world\'s population look as if it is rising as fast as ever. It took 250,000 years to reach 1 billion, around 1800; over a century more to reach 2 billion (in 1927); and 32 years more to reach 3 billion. But to rise from 5 billion (in 1987) to 6 billion took only 12 years; and now, another 12 years later, it is at 7 billion (see chart 1). By 2050, the UN thinks, there will be 9.3 billion people, requiring an island the size of Tenerife or Maui to stand on. Odd though it seems, however, the growth in the world\'s population is actually slowing. The peak of population growth was in the late 1960s, when the total was rising by almost 2% a year. Now the rate is half that. The last time it was so low was in 1950, when the death rate was much higher. The result is that the next billion people, according to the UN, will take 14 years to arrive, the first time that a billion milestone has taken longer to reach than the one before. The billion after that will take 18 years. Once upon a time, the passing of population milestones might have been cause for celebration. Now it gives rise to jeremiads. As Hillary Clinton\'s science adviser, Nina Fedoroff, told the BBC in 2009, “There are probably already too many people on the planet.” But the notion of “too many” is more flexible than it seems. The earth could certainly not support 10 billion hunter-gatherers, who used much more land per head than modern farm-fed people do. But it does not have to. The earth might well not be able to support 10 billion people if they had exactly the same impact per person as 7 billion do today. But that does not necessarily spell Malthusian doom, because the impact humans have on the earth and on each other can change. For most people, the big questions about population are: can the world feed 9 billion mouths by 2050? Are so many people ruining the environment? And will those billions, living cheek-by-jowl, go to war more often? On all three counts, surprising as it seems, reducing population growth any more quickly than it is falling anyway may not make much difference. Start with the link between population and violence. It seems plausible that the more young men there are, the more likely they will be to fight. This is especially true when groups are competing for scarce resources. Some argue that the genocidal conflict in Darfur, western Sudan, was caused partly by high population growth, which led to unsustainable farming and conflicts over land and water. Land pressure also influenced the Rwandan genocide of 1994, as migrants in search of a livelihood in one of the world\'s most densely populated countries moved into already settled areas, with catastrophic results. But there is a difference between local conflicts and what is happening on a global scale. Although the number of sovereign states has increased almost as dramatically as the world\'s population over the past half-century, the number of wars between states fell fairly continuously during the period. The number of civil wars rose, then fell. The number of deaths in battle fell by roughly three-quarters. These patterns do not seem to be influenced either by the relentless upward pressure of population, or by the slackening of that pressure as growth decelerates. The difference seems to have been caused by fewer post-colonial wars, the ending of cold-war alliances (and proxy wars) and, possibly, the increase in international peacekeepers. More people, more damage? Human activity has caused profound changes to the climate, biodiversity, oceanic acidity and greenhouse-gas levels in the atmosphere. But it does not automatically follow that the more people there are, the worse the damage. In 2007 Americans and Australians emitted almost 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide each. In contrast, more than 60 countries—including the vast majority of African ones—emitted less than 1 tonne per person. This implies that population growth in poorer countries (where it is concentrated) has had a smaller impact on the climate in recent years than the rise in the population of the United States (up by over 50% in 1970-2010). Most of the world\'s population growth in the next 20 years will occur in countries that make the smallest contribution to greenhouse gases. Global pollution will be more affected by the pattern of economic growth—and especially whether emerging nations become as energyintensive as America, Australia and China. Population growth does make a bigger difference to food. All things being equal, it is harder to feed 7 billion people than 6 billion. According to the World Bank, between 2005 and 2055 agricultural productivity will have to increase by two-thirds to keep pace with rising population and changing diets. Moreover, according to the bank, if the population stayed at 2005 levels, farm productivity would have to rise by only a quarter, so more future demand comes from a growing population than from consumption per person. Increasing farm productivity by a quarter would obviously be easier than boosting it by two-thirds. But even a rise of two-thirds is not as much as it sounds. From 1970-2010 farm productivity rose far more than this, by over three-and-a-half times. The big problem for agriculture is not the number of people, but signs that farm productivity may be levelling out. The growth in agricultural yields seems to be slowing down. There is little new farmland available. Water shortages are chronic and fertilisers are over-used. All these—plus the yield-reductions that may come from climate change, and wastefulness in getting food to markets—mean that the big problems are to do with supply, not demand. None of this means that population does not matter. But the main impact comes from relative changes—the growth of one part of the population compared with another, for example, or shifts in the average age of the population—rather than the absolute number of people. Of these relative changes, falling fertility is most important. The fertility rate is the number of children a woman can expect to have. At the moment, almost half the world\'s population—3.2 billion—lives in countries with a fertility rate of 2.1 or less. That number, the so-called replacement rate, is usually taken to be the level at which the population eventually stops growing. The world\'s decline in fertility has been staggering (see chart 2). In 1970 the total fertility rate was 4.45 and the typical family in the world had four or five children. It is now 2.45 worldwide, and lower in some surprising places. Bangladesh\'s rate is 2.16, having halved in 20 years. Iran\'s fertility fell from 7 in 1984 to just 1.9 in 2006. Countries with below-replacement fertility include supposedly teeming Brazil, Tunisia and Thailand. Much of Europe and East Asia have fertility rates far below replacement levels. The fertility fall is releasing wave upon wave of demographic change. It is the main influence behind the decline of population growth and, perhaps even more important, is shifting the balance of age groups within a population. When gold turns to silver A fall in fertility sends a sort of generational bulge surging through a society. The generation in question is the one before the fertility fall really begins to bite, which in Europe and America was the baby-boom generation that is just retiring, and in China and East Asia the generation now reaching adulthood. To begin with, the favoured generation is in its childhood; countries have lots of children and fewer surviving grandparents (who were born at a time when life expectancy was lower). That was the situation in Europe in the 1950s and in East Asia in the 1970s. But as the select generation enters the labour force, a country starts to benefit from a so-called “demographic dividend”. This happens when there are relatively few children (because of the fall in fertility), relatively few older people (because of higher mortality previously), and lots of economically active adults, including, often, many women, who enter the labour force in large numbers for the first time. It is a period of smaller families, rising income, rising life expectancy and big social change, including divorce, postponed marriage and single-person households. This was the situation in Europe between 1945 and 1975 (“les trente glorieuses”) and in much of East Asia in 1980-2010. But there is a third stage. At some point, the gilded generation turns silver and retires. Now the dividend becomes a liability. There are disproportionately more old people depending upon a smaller generation behind them. Population growth stops or goes into reverse, parts of a country are abandoned by the young and the social concerns of the aged grow in significance. This situation already exists in Japan. It is arriving fast in Europe and America, and soon after that will reach East Asia. A demographic dividend tends to boost economic growth because a large number of working-age adults increases the labour force, keeps wages relatively low, boosts savings and increases demand for goods and services. Part of China\'s phenomenal growth has come from its unprecedentedly low dependency ratio—just 38 (this is the number of dependents, children and people over 65, per 100 working adults; it implies the working-age group is almost twice as large as the rest of the population put together). One study by Australia\'s central bank calculated that a third of East Asia\'s GDP growth in 1965-90 came from its favourable demography. About a third of America\'s GDP growth in 2000-10 also came from its increasing population. The world as a whole reaped a demographic dividend in the 40 years to 2010. In 1970 there were 75 dependents for every 100 adults of working age. In 2010 the number of dependents dropped to just 52. Huge improvements were registered not only in China but also in South-East Asia and north Africa, where dependency ratios fell by 40 points. Even “ageing” Europe and America ended the period with fewer dependents than at the beginning. A demographic dividend does not automatically generate growth. It depends on whether the country can put its growing labour force to productive use. In the 1980s Latin America and East Asia had similar demographic patterns. But while East Asia experienced a long boom, Latin America endured its “lost decade”. One of the biggest questions for Arab countries, which are beginning to reap their own demographic dividends, is whether they will follow East Asia or Latin America. But even if demography guarantees nothing, it can make growth harder or easier. National demographic inheritances therefore matter. And they differ a lot. Where China loses Hania Zlotnik, the head of the UN\'s Population Division, divides the world into three categories, according to levels of fertility (see map). About a fifth of the world lives in countries with high fertility—3 or more. Most are Africans. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is one of the fastestgrowing parts of the world. In 1975 it had half the population of Europe. It overtook Europe in 2004, and by 2050 there will be just under 2 billion people there compared with 720m Europeans. About half of the 2.3 billion increase in the world\'s population over the next 40 years will be in Africa. The rest of the world is more or less equally divided between countries with below-replacement fertility (less than 2.1) and those with intermediate fertility (between 2.1 and 3). The first group consists of Europe, China and the rest of East Asia. The second comprises South and South-East Asia, the Middle East and the Americas (including the United States). The low-fertility countries face the biggest demographic problems. The elderly share of Japan\'s population is already the highest in the world. By 2050 the country will have almost as many dependents as working-age adults, and half the population will be over 52. This will make Japan the oldest society the world has ever known. Europe faces similar trends, less acutely. It has roughly half as many dependent children and retired people as working-age adults now. By 2050 it will have three dependents for every four adults, so will shoulder a large burden of ageing, which even sustained increases in fertility would fail to reverse for decades. This will cause disturbing policy implications in the provision of pensions and health care, which rely on continuing healthy tax revenues from the working population. At least these countries are rich enough to make such provision. Not so China. With its fertility artificially suppressed by the one-child policy, it is ageing at an unprecedented rate. In 1980 China\'s median age (the point where half the population is older and half younger) was 22 years, a developing-country figure. China will be older than America as early as 2020 and older than Europe by 2030. This will bring an abrupt end to its cheap-labour manufacturing. Its dependency ratio will rise from 38 to 64 by 2050, the sharpest rise in the world. Add in the country\'s sexual imbalances— after a decade of sex-selective abortions, China will have 96.5m men in their 20s in 2025 but only 80.3m young women—and demography may become the gravest problem the Communist Party has to face. Many countries with intermediate fertility—South-East Asia, Latin America, the United States—are better off. Their dependency ratios are not deteriorating so fast and their societies are ageing more slowly. America\'s demographic profile is slowly tugging it away from Europe. Though its fertility rate may have fallen recently, it is still slightly higher than Europe\'s. In 2010 the two sides of the Atlantic had similar dependency rates. By 2050 America\'s could be nearly ten points lower. But the biggest potential beneficiaries are the two other areas with intermediate fertility—India and the Middle East—and the high-fertility continent of Africa. These places have long been regarded as demographic time-bombs, with youth bulges, poverty and low levels of education and health. But that is because they are moving only slowly out of the early stage of high fertility into the one in which lower fertility begins to make an impact. At the moment, Africa has larger families and more dependent children than India or Arab countries and is a few years younger (its median age is 20 compared with their 25). But all three areas will see their dependency ratios fall in the next 40 years, the only parts of the world to do so. And they will keep their median ages low—below 38 in 2050. If they can make their public institutions less corrupt, keep their economic policies outward-looking and invest more in education, as East Asia did, then Africa, the Middle East and India could become the fastest-growing parts of the world economy within a decade or so. Here’s looking at you Demography, though, is not only about economics. Most emerging countries have benefited from the sort of dividend that changed Europe and America in the 1960s. They are catching up with the West in terms of income, family size and middle-class formation. Most say they want to keep their cultures unsullied by the social trends—divorce, illegitimacy and so on—that also affected the West. But the growing number of never-married women in urban Asia suggests that this will be hard. If you look at the overall size of the world\'s population, then, the picture is one of falling fertility, decelerating growth and a gradual return to the flat population level of the 18th century. But below the surface societies are being churned up in ways not seen in the much more static pre-industrial world. The earth\'s population may never need a larger island than Maui to stand on. But the way it arranges itself will go on shifting for centuries to come.","output":"Part A - Constructing Growth Models 1) Linear Growth Model: A linear growth model implies a constant rate of population increase over time. For example, if a population increases by a fixed number of individuals each year, we can model this as: [ P(t) = P_0 + rt ] where: - (P(t)) is the population at time (t), - (P_0) is the initial population at the starting period, - (r) is the constant rate of population increase per time period, and - (t) is the time period. For a linear model, we could select a domain interval during a historical period when the population growth appeared to be linear, which might be difficult given that the real world rarely exhibits perfect linear growth over extended periods. A short-term interval might suffice, where variations from linearity are minimal. 2) Exponential Growth Model: Exponential growth occurs when the rate of population increase is proportional to the current population. The function is represented as: [ P(t) = P_0 e^{rt} ] where: - (P_0) is the initial population, - (e) is Euler\'s number (approximately 2.71828), - (r) is the growth rate, and - (t) is the time. A realistic domain interval for this model might be during earlier human history, or during periods of industrial or technological booms when population growth rates were high and resources were not limiting. 3) Logistic Growth Function: Logistic growth takes into account the carrying capacity of the environment. The logistic growth function is described by the equation: [ P(t) = frac{K}{1 + left(frac{K - P_0}{P_0}right)e^{-rt}} ] where: - (P(t)) is the population at time (t), - (P_0) is the initial population, - (r) is the intrinsic growth rate, - (K) is the carrying capacity of the environment, and - (t) is time. Unlike the linear and exponential models, the entire graph should be considered, as the growth rate changes over time, with the population approaching the carrying capacity asymptotically. Part B - Estimating Logistic Growth Model Features a) Inflection Point: The inflection point occurs at half of the carrying capacity (K/2). At this point, the growth rate changes from increasing to decreasing. b) Highest Rate of Growth: The highest growth rate occurs at the inflection point. Mathematically, this is when (P(t) = K/2). c) Population in 2050 AD, 2100 AD: We would need to know or estimate values for (P_0), (r), and (K) to calculate the population at these future times using the logistic growth function. d) Total Population Born Between Year 0 AD and Year 2500 AD: To find this total, we need to integrate the logistic growth function from 0 to 2500, which gives us the total population over time. Adjustments may be needed for accuracy, considering deaths and other demographic factors. Part C - Tasked to Semester 2 Since Part C pertains to Semester 2 material, let\'s focus on A and B for now. *Software Applications: For modeling and computation, software such as MATLAB, R, Python (with libraries like NumPy and SciPy), or even spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel could be used to construct these models and make the necessary calculations and visualizations.

La obra es una ficción histórica que nos transporta a la República Dominicana durante el tiempo de la dictadura de Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, quien mantuvo un férreo y brutal gobierno de 1930 a 1961. La novela entrelaza distintas historias y perspectivas, mezclando personajes ficcionales con figuras históricas, y se sumerge en las complejidades de la vida bajo la opresión y la violencia de un régimen autoritario. Vargas Llosa explora temas de poder, corrupción, resistencia y la naturaleza humana ante condiciones extremas. **Desarrollo:** La narrativa de \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\" se divide en tres hilos argumentales que se van intercalando a lo largo de la novela: 1. **La historia de Urania Cabral:** Una mujer que regresa a la República Dominicana tras treinta y cinco años de autoexilio en Nueva York. A través de su relato y recuerdos, el lector se entera de las circunstancias de la vida bajo Trujillo y del impacto personal y familiar de la dictadura. Urania fue víctima de una de las atrocidades de Trujillo, lo cual revela la deshumanización y abuso que ejercía el dictador sobre su pueblo. 2. **El declive y asesinato de Trujillo:** La novela nos lleva por los eventos que conducen al fin de la dictadura, centrando la atención en los conspiradores y sus motivos para participar en el complot para asesinar al \\"Chivo\\". Estos personajes brindan una visión interna de la decadencia de Trujillo, del entorno palaciego y de la cúpula del poder que se va desmoronando. 3. **Retrospectivas sobre la vida de Trujillo y su régimen:** A través de flashbacks y reflexiones de los personajes, la novela detalla tanto la esfera pública como la privada de Trujillo, mostrando la psicología de un dictador y las características de su gobierno, basado en el terror, el control absoluto y la corrupción. La narración también aborda las intervenciones de Estados Unidos en la política dominicana y cómo esto moldeó la historia de la isla. La narrativa detallada, el ambiente y las complejidades psicológicas de los personajes son habilmente retratados por Vargas Llosa, quien utiliza su maestría literaria para dar vida a esta época oscura. **Conclusión:** En \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\", Vargas Llosa ofrece una profunda reflexión sobre las dinámicas de poder y la naturaleza de la tiranía. La novela concluye con un sentimiento agridulce. Por una parte, la caída de Trujillo representa el fin de un régimen opresor, pero al mismo tiempo, se cuestiona la capacidad de una sociedad de liberarse verdaderamente de las cicatrices del totalitarismo. La historia de Urania Cabral cierra con un tono de catarsis y reconciliación personal, aunque queda claro que las heridas infligidas por la dictadura perduran. A través de esta obra, Vargas Llosa no solo narra hechos históricos sino que también advierte sobre los peligros del poder absoluto y la importancia de la memoria y la justicia en la construcción de democracias sólidas."},{"instruction":"I want to learn about Order to cash process to get a job, divide this topic into multiple topics and topics into sub topic. explain each topic and its sub topic one by one. use examples and mnemonic for it. after explaining each topic prepare list of relevant questions for it.","output":"The Order to Cash (O2C or OTC) process is a sequence of business procedures by which companies receive, process, manage, and complete orders for goods or services and realize revenue. To break down this complex process, we can divide it into several topics, and then further into subtopics. **1. Order Management** - **Order Placement**: The initial stage involves a customer placing an order. This can happen through various channels, such as online, in person, or over the phone. The order details, such as the items, quantities, and customer information, are recorded. - **Order Processing**: Once an order is received, it needs to be verified for accuracy and completeness. This includes checking inventory levels to ensure the items are in stock. - **Order Fulfillment**: In this step, the items are picked from the inventory, packed, and then shipped to the customer. The efficiency of this process is critical for customer satisfaction. *Mnemonic for Order Management*: **POP-F** (Placement, Order Processing, Fulfillment) *Example*: An online retailer receives an order for a laptop. The order is reviewed for its accuracy and checked against inventory. Once confirmed, the product is retrieved from the warehouse, packaged, and shipped to the customer\'s address. **2. Credit Management** - **Credit Assessment**: Before processing an order, a company may assess the customer’s creditworthiness to ensure they can pay for the goods or services. This might involve conducting credit checks and setting credit limits. - **Credit Approval**: If the credit assessment is positive, the company will approve credit for the order. *Mnemonic for Credit Management*: **CA-CA** (Credit Assessment, Credit Approval) *Example*: A business customer wants to place a large order. The company checks the customer’s credit history and finds a good track record of payments. Consequently, the company approves a credit limit that will cover the new order. **3. Billing and Invoicing** - **Invoice Creation**: After the order is fulfilled, an invoice is generated detailing the cost of goods or services provided, along with any taxes or additional fees. - **Invoice Delivery**: The invoice is sent to the customer using their preferred delivery method, which could be mail, email, or a web portal. *Mnemonic for Billing and Invoicing*: **CID** (Creation, Invoice, Delivery) *Example*: Once the laptop is shipped, the online retailer generates an invoice that includes the price of the laptop, sales tax, shipping fees, and sends it to the customer via email. **4. Payment Collection** - **Payment Reception**: The company monitors receipt of payment by the due date specified on the invoice. Payments can be made through various methods like bank transfer, checks, or credit card payments. - **Payment Reconciliation**: This step involves matching received payments to their corresponding invoices and ensuring that all payments are accounted for correctly. *Mnemonic for Payment Collection*: **PR-PayR** (Payment Reception, Payment Reconciliation) *Example*: The online retailer receives a credit card payment for the laptop. They match this payment with the invoice earlier sent to the customer to ensure accurate accounting. **5. Dispute Management** - **Dispute Identification**: Any discrepancies between what was ordered and what was received or billed can trigger a dispute from the customer’s side. - **Dispute Resolution**: In this stage, the company investigates and resolves the dispute, which might result in issuing a credit note, a refund, or re-invoicing. *Mnemonic for Dispute Management*: **DIR** (Dispute Identification, Resolution) *Example*: The customer receives the laptop but finds it\'s the wrong model. They raise a dispute, leading to the retailer investigating the issue and sending the correct model. **6. Reporting and Data Management** - **Sales Reporting**: Analyzing and reporting on sales data for internal use, to understand revenue, customer payment behavior, and overall process efficiency. - **Data Analysis for Decision Making**: Using the collected data to inform strategic decisions and improvements to the order to cash process. *Mnemonic for Reporting and Data Management*: **SAD** (Sales, Analysis, Decision-making) *Example*: The retailer reviews monthly sales reports to identify trends and areas for improvement in the order processing and fulfillment process. **Relevant Questions** 1. What are the steps involved in the Order to Cash process? 2. How do you ensure the accurate processing of an order? 3. What considerations are made during a customer’s credit assessment? 4.

Now, let\'s evaluate the integral: [int_{-2}^{2} (4-x^2)^{frac{3}{2}} , dx] To integrate this function, it\'s helpful to use a trigonometric substitution. We can substitute (x = 2sin(theta)) (since (x) ranges from -2 to 2, (theta) will range from (-frac{pi}{2}) to (frac{pi}{2})), which implies (dx = 2cos(theta) dtheta). Also, by using this substitution, we are leveraging the Pythagorean identity (sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1), so (4 - x^2 = 4 - (2sin(theta))^2 = 4 - 4sin^2(theta) = 4cos^2(theta)). Substituting: [ int (4 - (2sin(theta))^2)^{frac{3}{2}} cdot 2cos(theta) dtheta ] [ = int (4cos^2(theta))^{frac{3}{2}} cdot 2cos(theta) dtheta ] [ = int 8cos^3(theta) cos(theta) dtheta ] [ = 8int cos^4(theta) dtheta ] Now, we can apply half-angle identities to solve the integral of (cos^4(theta)). The identity is (cos^2(theta) = frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2}), and applying it twice gives: [ cos^4(theta) = left(frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4} (1 + 2cos(2theta) + cos^2(2theta)) ] Plugging this back into the integral, we get: [ 8int frac{1}{4} (1 + 2cos(2theta) + cos^2(2theta)) dtheta ] [ = 2int (1 + 2cos(2theta) + frac{1 + cos(4theta)}{2}) dtheta ] [ = 2int (1 + 2cos(2theta) + frac{1}{2} + frac{cos(4theta)}{2}) dtheta ] [ = 2int left(frac{3}{2} + 2cos(2theta) + frac{cos(4theta)}{2}right) dtheta ] [ = 2 left[frac{3}{2}theta + sin(2theta) + frac{sin(4theta)}{8}right] ] We then need to convert back to the original variable (x) by using (x = 2sin(theta)) and (cos(theta) = sqrt{1-sin^2(theta)} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{x}{2}right)^2}). The bounds on (theta) corresponding to the bounds on (x) of -2 to 2 are (-frac{pi}{2}) to (frac{pi}{2}). Due to the symmetry of the integral limits and the even nature of the original function, the terms involving sine will cancel out as sine is an odd function and the limits are symmetric around the origin. So, we only need to compute the integral for the constant term: [ = 2 left[frac{3}{2}thetaright]_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} ] [ = 3 left[thetaright]_{-frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{pi}{2}} ] [ = 3left(frac{pi}{2} - (-frac{pi}{2})right) ] [ = 3pi ] Thus the integral evaluates to (3pi)."},{"instruction":"the answer is 6pi","output":"I apologize for the confusion. Let\'s revisit the computation with the correct trigonometric substitution. We have: [ int_{-2}^{2} (4-x^2)^{frac{3}{2}} , dx ] By using the trigonometric substitution ( x = 2sin(theta) ), ( dx = 2cos(theta)dtheta ), our limits for ( theta ) (corresponding to ( x = -2 ) and ( x = 2 )) change from ( -pi/2 ) to ( pi/2 ). The integral becomes: [ int_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} (4 - (2sin(theta))^2)^{frac{3}{2}} cdot 2cos(theta) , dtheta ] [ = int_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} (4 - 4sin^2(theta))^{frac{3}{2}} cdot 2cos(theta) , dtheta ] [ = 8int_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} (cos^2(theta))^{frac{3}{2}} cos(theta) , dtheta ] [ = 8int_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} cos^4(theta) , dtheta ] Now let\'s solve the integral. As in the previous explanation, we will use the double angle identity for cosine, ( cos^2(theta) = frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2} ), and we expand ( cos^4(theta) ): [ cos^4(theta) = left(frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2}right)^2 ] [ = frac{1}{4}(1 + 2cos(2theta) + cos^2(2theta)) ] We also need to apply the identity again to break down ( cos^2(2theta) ): [ cos^2(2theta) = frac{1 + cos(4theta)}{2} ] Plugging these into the integral, we have: [ 8int_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} frac{1}{4} left(1 + 2cos(2theta) + frac{1 + cos(4theta)}{2}right) dtheta ] [ = 2int_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} left(1 + 2cos(2theta) + frac{1}{2} + frac{cos(4theta)}{2}right) dtheta ] [ = 2int_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} left(frac{3}{2} + 2cos(2theta) + frac{cos(4theta)}{2}right) dtheta ] Next, let\'s integrate term-by-term: [ = 2 left[ frac{3}{2}theta + sin(2theta) + frac{sin(4theta)}{8} right]_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} ] Now, observe: - The (sin(2theta)) term will vanish because ( sin(2theta) ) is an odd function, and our limits are symmetric around ( theta = 0 ). - Similarly, the ( sin(4theta) ) term also vanishes because ( sin(4theta) ) is an odd function. So, we are left with: [ = 2 times frac{3}{2} left[ theta right]_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} ] [ = 3 left[ theta right]_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} ] [ = 3 left[ pi/2 - (-pi/2) right] ] [ = 3 (pi/2 + pi/2) ] [ = 3 pi ] It appears the calculation was previously correct, and the integral indeed evaluates to (3pi). If you\'ve come across an answer of (6pi), please make sure to verify the correctness of that result, as according to the performed integral calculation here, the answer should be (3pi)."},{"instruction":"int _{-2}^2:int _{-sqrt{left(4-x^2right)}}^{sqrt{left(4-x^2right)}}:int _{x^2+y^2}^4:dz:dy:dx using polar,spherical or cylindrical coordinate system","output":"To evaluate the triple integral [ int _{-2}^2int _{-sqrt{4-x^2}}^{sqrt{4-x^2}}int _{x^2+y^2}^4 dz , dy , dx ] we can convert the integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, as it involves rotationally symmetric bounds, particularly useful when integrating over circular regions and radial distances. In cylindrical coordinates, we have: - ( x = rcos(theta) ) - ( y = rsin(theta) ) - ( z ) remains the same - The Jacobian determinant for the transformation ( |J| = r ), which is the scaling factor for the differential area element. The given bounds describe a cylinder where ( z ) ranges from the cylinder\'s lateral surface (( x^2 + y^2 )) to the top surface at ( z = 4 ), with ( x ) and ( y ) bounded by a circle of radius 2 (hence, ( r ) ranges from 0 to 2). Converting the integral, we get: [ int_{0}^{2pi} int_{0}^{2} int_{r^2}^{4} r , dz , dr , dtheta ] where: - ( theta ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 2pi ) to cover the full circle, - ( r ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 2 ) (the radius of the circle), - ( z ) ranges from ( r^2 ) (the cylinder\'s lateral surface when projected onto the z-axis) to ( 4 ) (the top surface of the cylinder). Now, we evaluate the innermost integral with respect to ( z ): [ int_{r^2}^{4} r , dz = r[z]_{r^2}^{4} = r(4 - r^2) ] Now we integrate with respect to ( r ): [ int_{0}^{2} r(4 - r^2) , dr = int_{0}^{2} 4r - r^3 , dr = [2r^2 - frac{r^4}{4}]_{0}^{2} = 2(2)^2 - frac{(2)^4}{4} - 0 = 8 - frac{16}{4} = 8 - 4 = 4 ] Finally, we integrate with respect to ( theta ): [ int_{0}^{2pi} 4 , dtheta = 4[theta]_{0}^{2pi} = 4(2pi - 0) = 8pi ] Therefore, the result of the triple integral is: [ int_{-2}^{2}int_{-sqrt{4-x^2}}^{sqrt{4-x^2}}int_{x^2+y^2}^{4} dz , dy , dx = 8pi ]"},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

Aquí hay una descripción paso a paso de cómo hacerlo: 1. **Creación del archivo de propiedades**: Crea un archivo de propiedades (usualmente llamado `ValidationMessages.properties`) dentro del directorio `resources` de tu proyecto. Este archivo contendrá todas las plantillas de mensajes de validación. ```properties # ValidationMessages.properties validation.notBlank=El campo {0} es obligatorio. validation.email=El correo electrónico no es válido. validation.size=El campo {0} debe tener como máximo {max} caracteres. validation.past=La fecha de nacimiento debe ser una fecha pasada. validation.identityFormat=La identificación debe contener exactamente 13 dígitos. validation.phoneFormat=El número de teléfono debe tener 10 dígitos. ``` 2. **Referencia de mensajes en las anotaciones**: En las clases donde deseas realizar la validación, utiliza la clave de la plantilla del archivo de propiedades. ```java package dto.request; import jakarta.validation.constraints.*; import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; import lombok.Data; import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; import java.time.LocalDate; @Data @AllArgsConstructor @NoArgsConstructor public class CreateClientRequest { @NotBlank(message = \\"{validation.notBlank}\\") @Size(max = 255, message = \\"{validation.size}\\") private String name; @NotBlank(message = \\"{validation.notBlank}\\") @Pattern(regexp = \\"d{13}\\", message = \\"{validation.identityFormat}\\") private String identity; @Past(message = \\"{validation.past}\\") private LocalDate birthdate; @NotBlank(message = \\"{validation.notBlank}\\") @Email(message = \\"{validation.email}\\") @Size(max = 100, message = \\"{validation.size}\\") private String email; @Size(max = 255, message = \\"{validation.size}\\") private String address; @Pattern(regexp = \\"d{10}\\", message = \\"{validation.phoneFormat}\\") private String phone; } ``` 3. **Configuración del proveedor de validación**: Asegúrate de que tu framework de validación (como Hibernate Validator u otro proveedor JSR 380) esté configurado para localizar y usar el archivo `ValidationMessages.properties`. La mayoría de los proveedores de validación localizarán automáticamente este archivo si está ubicado en el classpath del proyecto (por ejemplo, dentro del directorio `src/main/resources`). Con esta configuración, cualquier cambio en los mensajes de validación se manejará de manera centralizada en el archivo de propiedades. Esto permite una fácil mantenimiento y reutilización de las plantillas de mensajes en diferentes clases. Por otro lado, si deseas pasar parámetros específicos para ser reemplazados en los mensajes (por ejemplo, el nombre del campo), es posible que debas realizar configuraciones adicionales o implementar una lógica personalizada dependiendo del proveedor de validación que estés utilizando. La funcionalidad mostrada aquí es una simplificación y puede no ofrecer reemplazo de parámetros sin implementación adicional."},{"instruction":"# ValidationMessage.properties validation.notBlank=El campo {0} es obligatorio. validation.email=El correo electrónico no es válido. validation.size=El campo {0} debe tener como máximo {max} caracteres. validation.past=La fecha de nacimiento debe ser una fecha pasada. validation.identityFormat=La identificación debe contener exactamente 13 dígitos. validation.phoneFormat=El número de teléfono debe tener 10 dígitos. Se puede reemplazar esto en ValidationMessage.yml?","output":"Sí, es posible utilizar archivos YAML (`.yml` o `.yaml`) para almacenar mensajes de validación en aplicaciones Spring, ya que Spring admite la externalización de la configuración en archivos YAML. Sin embargo, debes tener en cuenta que de manera predeterminada, la especificación de Bean Validation (JSR 380) y sus implementaciones como Hibernate Validator, buscan mensajes de validación en archivos `.properties`, no en YAML. Si estás trabajando con Spring Boot, puedes cargar mensajes de validación personalizados desde un archivo `application.yml` y referenciarlos en tus anotaciones de validación usando el soporte de Spring para internacionalización y mensajes. Aquí te muestro cómo podrías reemplazar `ValidationMessages.properties` por `ValidationMessages.yml` utilizando Spring Boot: 1. **Especificar mensajes en application.yml**: Añade las claves de validación bajo un nodo específico en tu archivo `application.yml`. ```yaml # application.yml validation: notBlank: \\"El campo {0} es obligatorio.\\" email: \\"El correo electrónico no es válido.\\" size: \\"El campo {0} debe tener como máximo {max} caracteres.\\" past: \\"La fecha de nacimiento debe ser una fecha pasada.\\" identityFormat: \\"La identificación debe contener exactamente 13 dígitos.\\" phoneFormat: \\"El número de teléfono debe tener 10 dígitos.\\" ``` 2. **Registrar los mensajes en un `MessageSource`**: Configura un `MessageSource` en tu aplicación Spring Boot para utilizar los mensajes de `application.yml`. ```java @Configuration public class MessageSourceConfig { @Bean public MessageSource messageSource() { YamlMessageSource yamlMessageSource = new YamlMessageSource(); yamlMessageSource.setBasename(\\"classpath:application\\"); yamlMessageSource.setDefaultEncoding(\\"UTF-8\\"); yamlMessageSource.setAlwaysUseMessageFormat(true); return yamlMessageSource; } class YamlMessageSource extends ResourceBundleMessageSource { // Override necessary methods to support YAML } } ``` En este caso, tendrías que implementar una clase `YamlMessageSource` que sea capaz de leer el archivo YAML y proporcionar los mensajes a `MessageSource`. 3. **Utiliza el `MessageSource` para resolver mensajes**: Usa `MessageSource` inyectado para obtener mensajes en tus componentes. Sin embargo, para hacer todo esto, necesitarás implementar tu propia lógica para leer archivos YAML, o bien buscar una biblioteca que ya lo implemente, ya que `ResourceBundleMessageSource` no admite YAML de forma predeterminada. Normalmente, este tipo de implementación puede no ser necesaria para una aplicación típica de Spring Boot, ya que la configuración predeterminada de Spring Boot y la ubicación estándar de los mensajes de validación en archivos `.properties` son suficientes para la mayoría de casos. Si no requieres una funcionalidad específica que solo pueda ser satisfecha por YAML, es recomendable utilizar la convención de archivos `.properties` para los mensajes de validación. Si todavía prefieres usar YAML por consistencia o para mantener toda la configuración en el mismo formato, asegúrate de que el esfuerzo y la complejidad adicional estén justificados para tu caso de uso."},{"instruction":"¿Cómo puedo pasar el nombre del campo en validation.past?","output":"En el contexto de la Bean Validation API junto con las anotaciones de validación, no hay soporte incorporado para pasar nombres de campos o parámetros adicionales directamente en el mensaje de validación definido en las anotaciones. La sustitución de parámetros generalmente se limita a valores como `{max}` o `{min}`, que son proporcionados automáticamente por la propia anotación de validación. Sin embargo, si estás utilizando Spring Boot, puedes aprovechar el manejo de excepciones y los mensajes de error personalizados, para construir mensajes que incluyan los nombres de los campos en el momento del error. Esto generalmente se realiza dentro de un `@ControllerAdvice` o, en caso de APIs Rest, un `@RestControllerAdvice` con un manejador de excepciones que puede capturar `MethodArgumentNotValidException` o `ConstraintViolationException`. Aquí hay un ejemplo de cómo puedes capturar excepciones de validación y formatear mensajes de error que incluyen el nombre del campo en un REST API con Spring Boot: ```java @RestControllerAdvice public class RestExceptionHandler { @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) public ResponseEntity<?> handleValidationExceptions(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) { Map<String, String> errors = new HashMap<>(); ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().forEach(error -> { String fieldName = error.getField(); String message = error.getDefaultMessage(); errors.put(fieldName, message.replace(\\"{0}\\", fieldName)); }); return new ResponseEntity<>(errors, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } ``` En este ejemplo, se captura `MethodArgumentNotValidException`, que se lanza cuando un objeto no pasa la validación en un controlador REST. Luego, iteramos sobre los errores de campo y construimos un mapa con nombres de campo y sus mensajes de error asociados. Nota que aquí estamos reemplazando manualmente `{0}` por el nombre del campo, lo que implica que tienes que asegurarte de que tus mensajes de validación en la propiedad o archivo YML usen `{0}` donde quieras incluir el nombre del campo: ```properties # ValidationMessages.properties validation.notBlank=El campo {0} es obligatorio. validation.email=El correo electrónico proporcionado para el campo {0} no es válido. validation.size=El campo {0} debe tener como máximo {max} caracteres. validation.past=El campo {0} debe ser una fecha pasada. validation.identityFormat=El campo {0} debe contener exactamente 13 dígitos. validation.phoneFormat=El campo {0} debe tener 10 dígitos. ``` En la implementación del `@ExceptionHandler`, estamos utilizando `error.getField()` para obtener el nombre del campo y `error.getDefaultMessage()` para obtener el mensaje de error por defecto asociado con la violación de la validación. Este enfoque permite una personalización considerable de los mensajes de error pero requiere que controles manualmente la sustitución de `\\"{0}\\"` con el nombre del campo. Para entornos que no son Spring, o si deseas tener una solución que no dependa de manejar excepciones en tiempo de ejecución, podrías necesitar implementar un mecanismo personalizado de generación de mensajes, que podría incluir la creación de tu propio conjunto de anotaciones de validación y validadores asociados."},{"instruction":"¿Cómo configura el punto 3. Configuración del proveedor de validación: Asegúrate de que tu framework de validación (como Hibernate Validator u otro proveedor JSR 380) esté configurado para localizar y usar el archivo ValidationMessages.properties?","output":"Por defecto, Hibernate Validator y otros proveedores de Bean Validation buscan automáticamente un archivo llamado `ValidationMessages.properties` en el classpath de tu aplicación para mensajes de validación personalizados. Este archivo no requiere ninguna configuración adicional si se coloca directamente en el directorio `src/main/resources` de una aplicación Java estándar o Maven/Gradle. Sin embargo, si por algún motivo necesitas especificar un archivo de mensajes diferente o personalizar la configuración de la validación, puedes hacerlo de la siguiente manera: # Configurar `ValidationMessages.properties`: 1. **Añadir el archivo `ValidationMessages.properties` al classpath**: Coloca el archivo `ValidationMessages.properties` en el directorio `src/main/resources` de tu proyecto Maven o Gradle. Por ejemplo: ```plaintext project-root └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ ValidationMessages.properties ``` Dentro de `ValidationMessages.properties`, tendrías algo como esto: ```properties # ValidationMessages.properties javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank.message = El campo no debe estar en blanco. javax.validation.constraints.Email.message = La dirección de correo electrónico no es válida. # Más mensajes personalizados... ``` 2. **Configura el proveedor de validaciones si es necesario**: Si necesitas cambiar la localización predeterminada o si estás cargando desde una fuente que no es el classpath, deberás configurarlo manualmente. Para una aplicación que no utiliza Spring Boot, esto podría implicar generar una `ValidatorFactory` programáticamente y proporcionarle la configuración adecuada. Por ejemplo: ```java import org.hibernate.validator.HibernateValidator; import org.hibernate.validator.HibernateValidatorConfiguration; import javax.validation.Validation; import javax.validation.Validator; import javax.validation.ValidatorFactory; public class CustomValidatorFactory { public Validator createValidator() { HibernateValidatorConfiguration configuration = Validation .byProvider(HibernateValidator.class) .configure(); configuration.messageInterpolator( new ResourceBundleMessageInterpolator( new PlatformResourceBundleLocator(\\"MyValidationMessages\\") ) ); ValidatorFactory factory = configuration.buildValidatorFactory(); return factory.getValidator(); } } ``` En este caso, \\"`MyValidationMessages`\\" será el nombre de tu archivo personalizado de mensajes de validación (sin la extensión `.properties`), que también debería estar ubicado en el classpath. # Usando Spring Boot: Cuando usas Spring Boot, generalmente no es necesario configurar nada adicional ya que Spring Boot configura Hibernate Validator para que use automáticamente el archivo `ValidationMessages.properties` del classpath. Si aún necesitas personalizar la configuración de validación, puedes definir tu propio `LocalValidatorFactoryBean`. Por ejemplo: ```java import org.springframework.context.MessageSource; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.support.ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource; import org.springframework.validation.beanvalidation.LocalValidatorFactoryBean; @Bean public LocalValidatorFactoryBean getValidator(MessageSource messageSource) { LocalValidatorFactoryBean bean = new LocalValidatorFactoryBean(); bean.setValidationMessageSource(messageSource); return bean; } @Bean public MessageSource messageSource() { ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource messageSource = new ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource(); messageSource.setBasename(\\"classpath:MyValidationMessages\\"); messageSource.setDefaultEncoding(\\"UTF-8\\"); return messageSource; } ``` Nuevamente, \\"`MyValidationMessages`\\" sería tu archivo personalizado. Por lo tanto, para la mayoría de los casos de uso, simplemente coloca tu archivo `ValidationMessages.properties` con los mensajes personalizados en el classpath y las implementaciones de Bean Validation y Spring Boot lo reconocerán automáticamente. La configuración adicional solo es necesaria en situaciones específicas en las que se requiere un comportamiento personalizado o cuando se trabaja fuera del contexto típico de Spring Boot/Classpath."},{"instruction":"Completar con más ejemplos. # ValidationMessages.properties javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank.message = El campo no debe estar en blanco. javax.validation.constraints.Email.message = La dirección de correo electrónico no es válida. # Más mensajes personalizados…","output":"Por supuesto, puedo proporcionarte más ejemplos de mensajes de validación personalizados en un archivo `ValidationMessages.properties`.

Por ejemplo, si defines una anotación `@Size(min=2, max=5)`, la Bean Validation API automáticamente reemplazará `{min}` y `{max}` con los valores `2` y `5`, respectivamente, en el mensaje de validación. Si deseas incluir el nombre del campo en el mensaje, como `{0}`, necesitas implementar un mecanismo personalizado. En el caso de Spring Boot, por ejemplo, se puede hacer un manejo de excepciones donde sustituyes manualmente `{0}` con el nombre del campo que falló la validación, como se mostró en ejemplos anteriores. Para resolver específicamente el problema del `{0}` en tus mensajes, primero necesita asegurarse de que estás realizando esa sustitución de manera programática. Aquí se muestra cómo podrías realizar esto en Spring Boot: ```java @RestControllerAdvice public class RestExceptionHandler { @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) public ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> handleValidationExceptions(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) { Map<String, String> errors = ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().stream() .collect(Collectors.toMap( FieldError::getField, error -> resolveErrorMessage(error) )); return new ResponseEntity<>(errors, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } private String resolveErrorMessage(FieldError error) { String message = error.getDefaultMessage(); if (message != null && message.contains(\\"{0}\\")) { return message.replace(\\"{0}\\", error.getField()); } return message; } } ``` En este ejemplo, se captura la `MethodArgumentNotValidException`, que es lanzada durante la validación de parámetros en un controller, se itera sobre todos los errores de campo, y se reemplaza el placeholder `{0}` con el nombre real del campo. Si no estás utilizando Spring Boot y deseas implementar una funcionalidad similar, deberás crear tu propio mensaje interpolador o algún otro mecanismo de post-procesamiento para insertar dinámicamente el nombre del campo en el mensaje de error. Recuerda que para que este enfoque funcione, debes asegurarte de que el mensaje de validación que se devuelva desde la anotación de validación incluya el placeholder `{0}` en el primer lugar. Esto puede ser configurado como se muestra en ejemplos anteriores, o directamente en las anotaciones si se define de esa manera en el archivo de mensajes de validación (por ejemplo, en `ValidationMessages.properties`)."},{"instruction":"@ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) public ResponseEntity<?> handle(MethodArgumentNotValidException exception) { // Extraer y coleccionar todos los mensajes de error de validación List<String> errorMessages = exception.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().stream() .map(fieldError -> Optional.ofNullable(fieldError.getDefaultMessage()).orElse(\\"Error de validación\\")) .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Devolver un String único en lugar de una lista // String combinedErrorMessage = String.join(\\"; \\", errorMessages); // Retornar todos los mensajes de error return new ResponseEntity<>(errorMessages, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } Cómo mantener en List<String> pero usar el método resolveErrorMessage?","output":"Para mantener los mensajes de error en una `List<String>` pero utilizando el método `resolveErrorMessage` para resolver y reemplazar automáticamente `{0}` con el nombre del campo, puedes modificar el código del `@ExceptionHandler` como sigue: Primero, asegúrate de definir tu método `resolveErrorMessage`, similar al que se mostró en ejemplos anteriores: ```java private String resolveErrorMessage(FieldError error) { String message = error.getDefaultMessage(); if (message != null && message.contains(\\"{0}\\")) { return message.replace(\\"{0}\\", error.getField()); } return message; } ``` Ahora, actualiza el método `handle` para incorporar el uso de `resolveErrorMessage`: ```java @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) public ResponseEntity<?> handle(MethodArgumentNotValidException exception) { // Extraer y coleccionar todos los mensajes de error de validación List<String> errorMessages = exception.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().stream() .map(this::resolveErrorMessage) .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Retornar todos los mensajes de error return new ResponseEntity<>(errorMessages, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } ``` Con esta implementación, cada instancia de `FieldError` se pasa al método `resolveErrorMessage`, que se encarga de sustituir el placeholder `{0}` con el nombre del campo que causó el error de validación. La lista resultante de mensajes de error se devuelve luego en la respuesta de la entidad. Recuerda que este código asume que tus mensajes de error personalizados ya contienen el placeholder `{0}`, y que lo vas a reemplazar con el nombre del campo para cada error de validación.

Deberás pasar un `MessageSource` a tu método `resolveErrorMessage` para que pueda resolver los nombres de los campos a partir de las claves en el archivo de propiedades. Aquí te muestro cómo puedes hacer esto en Spring Boot: Primero, asegúrate de que tienes un `MessageSource` configurado en tu aplicación. Por defecto, en Spring Boot, esto ya se configura automáticamente para ti. Luego, lo inyectas en tu clase que contiene el `@ExceptionHandler`: ```java @RestControllerAdvice public class RestExceptionHandler { private final MessageSource messageSource; public RestExceptionHandler(MessageSource messageSource) { this.messageSource = messageSource; } @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) public ResponseEntity<?> handle(MethodArgumentNotValidException exception, Locale locale) { List<String> errorMessages = exception.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().stream() .map(fieldError -> resolveErrorMessage(fieldError, locale)) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return new ResponseEntity<>(errorMessages, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } private String resolveErrorMessage(FieldError error, Locale locale) { String message = error.getDefaultMessage(); String fieldName = messageSource.getMessage(\\"field.\\" + error.getField(), null, locale); return (message != null && fieldName != null) ? message.replace(\\"{0}\\", fieldName) : message != null ? message : \\"Error de validación\\"; } } ``` En este ejemplo, `messageSource.getMessage` busca el nombre de campo personalizado basado en el código de campo (por ejemplo, `field.name` se convertirá en `Nombre Completo` si `error.getField()` devuelve `\\"name\\"`). El `locale` se pasa al método `handle` y `resolveErrorMessage` para que puedas proporcionar localización para los mensajes de error. Además, si ningún nombre de campo personalizado se encuentra para el campo dado, el código asume que se utiliza el propio nombre del campo. Tener en cuenta que en este ejemplo, el mensaje personalizado que se espera debe seguir incluyendo `{0}` para ser reemplazado por el nombre del campo. Asegúrate de que tus mensajes de error en `ValidationMessages.properties` estén configurados para usar este placeholder donde quieras que aparezca el nombre del campo. Este enfoque requiere que cada posible nombre de campo tenga una entrada correspondiente en `ValidationMessages.properties` bajo una clave con un prefijo específico, en este caso, `field.`."},{"instruction":"¿Por qué el Locale locale en public ResponseEntity<?> handle(MethodArgumentNotValidException exception, Locale locale)?","output":"Me disculpo por el error anterior; en efecto, hay un malentendido en mi respuesta previa. En el contexto de un `@ExceptionHandler` en Spring Boot, el `Locale` no se puede inyectar directamente en el método `handle`. En un controlador común de Spring MVC sí puedes obtener el `Locale` automáticamente como parámetro del método si estás procesando una petición HTTP y la configuración de internacionalización de Spring está activada. Sin embargo, en un `@ExceptionHandler`, debes obtener el `Locale` de otra manera. Una forma común de obtener el `Locale` en un `@ExceptionHandler` es utilizar `LocaleContextHolder`, que mantiene el `Locale` determinado por el `LocaleResolver` de Spring MVC, que a su vez considera la localización a partir de la petición HTTP actual. Aquí tienes una forma corregida de usar `LocaleContextHolder` en tu `@ExceptionHandler`: ```java @RestControllerAdvice public class RestExceptionHandler { private final MessageSource messageSource; public RestExceptionHandler(MessageSource messageSource) { this.messageSource = messageSource; } @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) public ResponseEntity<?> handle(MethodArgumentNotValidException exception) { // Obtener el Locale del contexto actual Locale locale = LocaleContextHolder.getLocale(); List<String> errorMessages = exception.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().stream() .map(fieldError -> resolveErrorMessage(fieldError, locale)) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return new ResponseEntity<>(errorMessages, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } private String resolveErrorMessage(FieldError error, Locale locale) { String message = error.getDefaultMessage(); String fieldNameKey = \\"field.\\" + error.getField(); String fieldName = messageSource.getMessage(fieldNameKey, null, fieldNameKey, locale); return (message != null && fieldName != null) ? message.replace(\\"{0}\\", fieldName) : message != null ? message : \\"Error de validación\\"; } } ``` Aquí, `LocaleContextHolder.getLocale()` se utiliza para obtener el `Locale` actual, que puede haber sido establecido por un `LocaleResolver` configurado en Spring MVC para manejar la localización basada en la petición HTTP (por ejemplo, dependiendo de la cabecera `Accept-Language` del cliente, una cookie, etc.). Tenga en cuenta que en la llamada a `messageSource.getMessage()`, si no se encuentra un mensaje personalizado para la clave proporcionada, se devuelve la misma clave como un mecanismo de fallback (`fieldNameKey` en este caso). Esto asegura que incluso si no existe una entrada de localización para el nombre del campo, el mensaje de error no será nulo y mostrará al menos el nombre técnico del campo."},{"instruction":"Cómo obtener el valor del field.name de ValidationMessages.properties en una clase?","output":"Para obtener el valor de una propiedad definida en `ValidationMessages.properties`, como `field.name`, en una clase Java, necesitarás acceder a los recursos de mensaje de tu aplicación. En un entorno Spring Boot, esto generalmente se hace a través del `MessageSource` de Spring. Aquí hay una guía paso a paso de cómo hacerlo: 1. **Asegúrate de que tu archivo `ValidationMessages.properties` esté en el classpath**: Coloca `ValidationMessages.properties` en `src/main/resources`, que es el classpath por defecto de las aplicaciones Spring Boot. 2. **Configura `MessageSource` si aún no está configurado**: Spring Boot configura automáticamente un `MessageSource` que puede acceder a propiedades de archivos. Sin embargo, si necesitas configurar uno personalizado, se vería así: ```java @Configuration public class MessageSourceConfig { @Bean public MessageSource messageSource() { ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource messageSource = new ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource(); messageSource.setBasename(\\"classpath:ValidationMessages\\"); messageSource.setDefaultEncoding(\\"UTF-8\\"); return messageSource; } } ``` De forma predeterminada, Spring Boot configura esto por ti, por lo que normalmente no es necesario hacer esta configuración a menos que desees personalizar algo. 3. **Inyecta `MessageSource` en tu clase**: Puedes inyectar `MessageSource` en cualquier componente de Spring usando `@Autowired` y luego usarlo para obtener el valor de un mensaje. Aquí hay un ejemplo de cómo obtener ese valor en un servicio: ```java @Service public class SomeService { private final MessageSource messageSource; // Constructor injection is the recommended way in Spring @Autowired public SomeService(MessageSource messageSource) { this.messageSource = messageSource; } public String getFieldName(String fieldNameKey) { // The second parameter is for providing any arguments for placeholder substitution. // The third parameter is the default message if the key is not found. // The fourth parameter is the locale, but it can be omitted to use the default. return messageSource.getMessage(\\"field.\\" + fieldNameKey, null, fieldNameKey, Locale.getDefault()); } } ``` En el ejemplo anterior, `SomeService` tiene un método `getFieldName` que toma una clave de nombre de campo (por ejemplo, `name`) y recupera el valor de mensaje correspondiente de `ValidationMessages.properties` (por ejemplo, `field.name` se convertirá en `Nombre Completo`). Los componentes de Spring Boot deberían preferir la inyección a través de constructores, como se muestra arriba, ya que es una buena práctica para la gestión de dependencias y promueve la inmutabilidad. Al usar `MessageSource`, no necesitas proporcionar un `Locale` si quieres usar el predeterminado. Un `Locale` específico es útil cuando tienes mensajes internacionalizados y necesitas obtener un mensaje para un `Locale` particular.

Esto debe hacerse antes de reemplazar el `{0}` en tu mensaje. Suponiendo que estás usando Spring y que `MessageSource` ha sido inyectado en tu clase, aquí hay una forma de modificar tu método `resolveErrorMessage` para que utilice el `MessageSource` para resolver el nombre del campo personalizado: ```java @Autowired private MessageSource messageSource; private String resolveErrorMessage(FieldError error) { Locale currentLocale = LocaleContextHolder.getLocale(); // Obtiene el Locale actual String message = error.getDefaultMessage(); // Obtiene el nombre del campo personalizado de ValidationMessages.properties String fieldName = messageSource.getMessage(\\"field.\\" + error.getField(), null, error.getField(), currentLocale); if (message != null) { // Reemplaza {0} en el mensaje de error con el nombre del campo personalizado. message = message.replace(\\"{0}\\", fieldName); } else { message = \\"Error de validación\\"; } return message; } ``` Ahora, cuando se llame a `resolveErrorMessage`, primero buscará el nombre de campo personalizado en `ValidationMessages.properties` utilizando la clave `field.` más el nombre del campo, y luego reemplazará `{0}` en el mensaje con ese nombre personalizado. Asegúrate de que tu `ValidationMessages.properties` contenga entradas para todos los campos personalizados que desees resolver, como: ``` field.name=Nombre Completo field.identity=Cédula de Identidad field.birthdate=Fecha de Nacimiento field.address=Dirección field.phone=Teléfono ``` Utilizar `LocaleContextHolder.getLocale()` proporcionará el `Locale` que se ha resuelto para la solicitud HTTP actual, y es lo que Spring utiliza para resolver mensajes basados en el idioma del cliente si estás utilizando internacionalización.

Usa el `MessageSource` para resolver los mensajes con el método `getMessage`, que permite obtener mensajes de los archivos de propiedades basados en claves y pasar argumentos de localización.

Puedes utilizar estos métodos para resolver mensajes o nombres de campos personalizados en cualquier parte de tu aplicación. Por ejemplo, si tienes las siguientes entradas en tu `ValidationMessages.properties`: ```properties field.name=Nombre Completo field.identity=Cédula de Identidad ``` Podrías llamar al método `getCustomFieldName` con `name` como argumento para obtener \\"Nombre Completo\\". Es importante recordar que en el método `getMessage` puedes pasar argumentos para los placeholders que tengas en tus mensajes, los cuales serán reemplazados en el mensaje final. En este ejemplo, no pasamos argumentos, por lo que se espera que los mensajes de `ValidationMessages.properties` no contengan placeholders o solo utilicen los placeholders `\\"{min}\\"`, `\\"{max}\\"`, etc., que son proporcionados automáticamente por las anotaciones de validación. Si estás utilizando validación y manejo de errores en un contexto global (como con `@RestControllerAdvice`), probablemente también querrás pasar el `Locale` que proviene del contexto del usuario, que puede ser más relevante para su localización específica.

Это означает, что напрямую отправить несколько файлов в рамках одного ответа не получится. Однако, есть несколько способов обойти это ограничение: 1. **Архивирование файлов**: Вы можете запаковать несколько файлов в один архивный файл, например, в формате `.zip`, и вернуть этот архивный файл клиенту в ответе. 2. **Multipart ответ**: В веб-разработке существует `multipart` тип содержимого, который позволяет объединить несколько частей данных в одном HTTP ответе. Это обычно используется для загрузки файлов на сервер, но технически его можно использовать и для отправки данных с сервера клиенту. Однако, клиенту потребуется специальная логика для обработки такого ответа. 3. **Отдельные запросы**: Проще всего обрабатывать такую ситуацию, сделав систему такой, что клиент посылает отдельные запросы для каждого файла, который он хочет получить. Вы можете вернуть клиенту список URL-ов для скачивания каждого файла, и клиент сможет последовательно скачать каждый файл по соответствующему URL. Пример кода для первого варианта с использованием FastAPI: ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse import zipfile import io app = FastAPI() @app.get(\\"/download\\") async def download_files(): # Создаем байтовый поток для хранения архива byte_stream = io.BytesIO() # Создаем ZIP-архив в байтовом потоке with zipfile.ZipFile(byte_stream, \\"w\\") as zip_file: # Записываем в архив несколько файлов (тут мы записываем просто текстовые данные в качестве примера) zip_file.writestr(\\"file1.txt\\", \\"Content of file 1\\") zip_file.writestr(\\"file2.txt\\", \\"Content of file 2\\") # ... добавляем остальные файлы, если они есть # Перемещаем указатель в начало байтового потока byte_stream.seek(0) # Возвращаем файл как потоковый ответ return StreamingResponse( byte_stream, media_type=\\"application/zip\\", headers={\\"Content-Disposition\\": \\"attachment; filename=files.zip\\"} ) ``` Когда клиент запросит URL `/download`, сервер вернет ему ZIP-архив с двумя файлами, которые можно будет разархивировать и использовать.

Общий итог Текст 1: Пролог – Надо бы поворачивать, – встревожился Гаред, как только лес вокруг них начал темнеть. – Одичалые мертвы. – Неужели ты боишься покойников? – вопросил сир Уэймар Ройс с легким намеком на улыбку. Гаред не попался на крючок. За свои пятьдесят лет он успел навидаться, как приходят и уходят эти господа. – Мертвый мертв, – отвечал он. – С ним не о чем говорить. – А они действительно мертвы? – спросил Ройс. – Какие доказательства есть у нас? – Уилл видел их, – отвечал Гаред. – И если он говорит, что они мертвы, мне других доказательств не нужно. Уилл знал, что его рано или поздно вовлекут в разговор, и хотел, чтобы это случилось по возможности позже. – Мать моя говорила мне, что покойник не запоет, – сказал он. – То же самое говорила моя няня, – отозвался Ройс. – Уилл, никогда не верь тому, что слышишь возле женской титьки. Есть вещи, которые можно узнать даже от мертвых. – Голос его слишком громко отдавался в сумрачном лесу. – Нам предстоит долгая дорога, – напомнил Гаред. – Восемь дней, а быть может, и девять. И ночь уже близка. Сир Уэймар Ройс поглядел на небо без всякого интереса. – Ночь каждый день приходит примерно в это же время. Неужели тьма лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? Уилл увидел, как напрягся рот Гареда, как сверкнул едва сдерживаемый гнев в глазах под толстым черным капюшоном плаща. Сорок лет – юность и зрелость – провел Гаред в Ночном Дозоре, и свое прошлое он уважал. Однако здесь крылось нечто большее. Под раненой гордостью старшего Уилл угадывал нервное напряжение, опасно приближающееся к страху. Уилл разделял это нелегкое чувство. На Стене он провел четыре года. И когда в первый раз отправился за нее, то сразу вспомнил все старые россказни и чрево его обратилось в воду. Потом, вспоминая первую вылазку, он смеялся. Сотня походов сделала его ветераном, и бесконечная мрачная чаща, которую южане зовут Зачарованным лесом, более не казалась ему ужасной. Но не сегодня. Сегодняшний вечер сулил иное. В этой тьме таилось нечто, заставлявшее подниматься волосы на его затылке. Девять дней они ехали на север, потом на северо-запад и снова на север, все дальше от Стены, преследуя банду дикарей-налетчиков. Каждый день был хуже предшествовавшего ему. И нынешний стал наихудшим. С севера задувал холодный ветер, деревья шелестели, словно живые. Весь день Уиллу казалось, что за ним следит нечто холодное и непреклонное, совершенно не испытывающее к нему симпатии. Гаред ощущал то же самое. Уилл хотел одного – броситься во всю конскую прыть под защиту Стены, но подобными чувствами не делятся со своим командиром. В особенности с таким командиром. Сир Уэймар Ройс был самым молодым отпрыском древнего рода, одним из многочисленных наследников. Симпатичный юноша лет восемнадцати, сероглазый, изящный и стройный, как клинок. Восседая на спине своего рослого вороного боевого коня, рыцарь возвышался над Уиллом и Гаредом на их невысоких дорожных лошадках. Все на нем: черные кожаные сапоги, черные шерстяные штаны, черные перчатки из кротовых шкурок и тонко выделанная куртка из блестящих черных кольчужных колец, нашитых на стеганые слои черной шерсти и вареной кожи, – говорило о принадлежности к Ночному Дозору. Сир Уэймар присягнул на верность братству менее полугода назад, и никто не мог сказать, что он не был подготовлен для такого занятия. Во всяком случае, если говорить о его гардеробе. Довершал одеяние плащ. Соболиный, толстый, черный и соблазнительно мягкий. – Клянется, что сам убил всех зверьков, вот так вот, – показывал Гаред в казарме за вином. – Свернул им головенки наш могучий воитель. Все дружно хохотали. Трудно повиноваться человеку, которого осмеиваешь за выпивкой, думал Уилл, ежившийся на спине своей лошаденки. Гаред, должно быть, испытывал те же чувства. – Мормонт приказал нам выследить их, и мы это сделали, – проговорил Гаред. – Одичалые мертвы. Более они не причинят хлопот. А нам предстоит тяжелая дорога. Мне не нравится погода. Если пойдет снег, на возвращение домой уйдет две недели, а ведь даже снегопад будет подарком. Вы когда-нибудь видели ледяную бурю, милорд? Лорденыш как будто и не слышал его. Ройс изучал сгущающийся сумрак в этакой полурассеянности-полускуке. Уилл успел достаточно долго проездить с рыцарем и знал – лучше не докучать ему в подобном настроении. – Опиши мне еще раз то, что ты видел, Уилл. Все подробности. Ничего не забудь. Прежде чем поступить в Ночной Дозор, Уилл был охотником, точнее говоря, браконьером. Вольные всадники Маллистеров взяли его с кровью на руках в собственных лесах Маллистеров, над освежеванной тушей одного из оленей, принадлежавших Маллистерам; так что ему осталось или надеть черное, или расстаться с рукой. Никто не умел двигаться по лесу безмолвнее Уилла, и Черные Братья весьма скоро обнаружили этот дар. – Их лагерь располагается в двух милях отсюда, за тем гребнем, возле ручья, – проговорил Уилл. – Я подобрался так близко, как только осмелился. Одичалых – восьмеро, есть и мужчины, и женщины. Я не видел там никаких детей. Они соорудили навес возле скалы. Теперь все засыпал снег, но я не заметил огня, хотя кострище было видно как на ладони. Никто не двигался, а ведь я долго следил за ними. Живому человеку не под силу пролежать так, не шевелясь. – А ты видел кровь? – Нет, – признал Уилл. – А оружие? – Несколько мечей и луков. У одного был топор, тяжелый такой, с двумя лезвиями… жестокое железо. Он лежал на земле возле этого человека, прямо у руки. – А ты заметил положение тел? Уилл пожал плечами: – Один сидел возле скалы. Остальные были на земле, попопадали, что ли. – Или спали, – предположил Ройс. – Упали, – настаивал Уилл. – Женщина влезла наверх железного дерева и пряталась среди ветвей. Дозорная. – Он тонко улыбнулся. – Я старался, чтобы она не увидела меня. Но когда подобрался ближе, то заметил, что и она не шевелится. – И против желания он поежился. – Тебе холодно? – спросил Ройс. – Слегка, – пробормотал Уилл. – Ветер, милорд. Молодой рыцарь повернулся к седому оруженосцу. Побитые морозом листья с шелестом пролетели мимо, и конь Ройса беспокойно шевельнулся. – Итак, какова, по-твоему, была причина смерти этих людей, Гаред? – непринужденно спросил сир Уэймар, поправляя длинный соболиный плащ. – Холод, – отвечал Гаред с железной уверенностью. – Прошлой зимой я видел, как замерзают люди, видел и позапрошлой, когда был еще наполовину мальчишкой. Все говорят о снегах глубиной в сорок футов, о том, как ледяной ветер, воя, налетает с севера, но главным врагом является холод. Он добирается до тебя бесшумнее, чем Уилл, и сперва ты только поеживаешься и стучишь зубами, а потом топаешь ногами и мечтаешь о подогретом вине с пряностями и чудесном жарком очаге. Мороз жжет. Ничто не обжигает, как холод. Но лишь поначалу. А потом он проникает внутрь тела, наполняет тебя, пока у человека не остается сил сопротивляться. Легче просто сесть и уснуть. Говорят, что, замерзая, перед концом не чувствуешь никакой боли. Просто слабеешь и тихонько засыпаешь, все словно блекнет, а потом как будто проваливаешься в море теплого молока, в мир и покой. – Экое красноречие, Гаред, – усмехнулся сир Уэймар. – Никогда не подозревал в тебе подобного дара. – Холод проникал и в меня, молодой лорд. – Гаред откинул назад капюшон, давая сиру Уэймару возможность рассмотреть обрубки, оставшиеся на месте ушей. – Два уха, три пальца на ногах и мизинец на левой руке. Я еще легко отделался. Моего брата тогда нашли замерзшим и улыбающимся. Сир Уэймар пожал плечами: – Надо было одеться потеплее, Гаред. Тот гневно глянул на юного лорда, шрамы на месте ушей, там, где мейстер Эйемон срезал обмороженный хрящ, налились кровью от гнева. – Посмотрим, как согреет тебя одежда, когда придет зима. – Он натянул на голову капюшон и сгорбился на своей лошади, угрюмый и молчаливый. – Если Гаред говорит, что было холодно… – начал Уилл. – А ты был в карауле на прошлой неделе, Уилл? – Да, милорд. – Ни одна неделя не проходила без того, чтобы ему не выпадало с дюжину этих паскудных караулов. Чего, собственно, Ройс хочет от него? – И какой была Стена? – Мокрой, – сказал Уилл хмурясь. Теперь он понял, чего добивается молодой лорд. – Они не могли замерзнуть. Ведь Стена подтаяла. Настоящего холода не было. Ройс кивнул: – Смышленый парень. На этой неделе несколько раз подмораживало, выпадал снег, но холодов, достаточно свирепых, чтобы убить восьмерых взрослых людей, не было. Напоминаю: одетых в меха и кожу, возле укрытия и костра. – Улыбка рыцаря сделалась самоуверенной. – Уилл, веди нас туда, я сам хочу увидеть этих мертвецов. Ну что ж, делать нечего. Приказ отдан, надо повиноваться. Уилл направился первым, его косматая невысокая лошадка внимательно выбирала путь через подлесок. Позапрошлой ночью выпал легкий снежок, и камни, корни и ямки прятались под его поверхностью, поджидая неосторожного и беспечного. Сир Уэймар Ройс следовал за ним, рослый вороной жеребец нетерпеливо фыркал. Боевой конь не годился для разведки, но попробуй это сказать его лордству. Гаред замыкал линию. Старый оруженосец что-то бурчал под нос. Сумерки сгущались. Неласковое небо сперва приняло глубокий пурпурный оттенок, потом цвет старого синяка и, наконец, почернело. Начали выступать звезды. Над деревьями объявился и полумесяц. Уилл обрадовался свету. – Можно бы и прибавить шагу, – заметил Ройс, когда луна поднялась повыше. – Я не уверен, – отвечал Уилл. Страх заставил его забыть про вежливость. – Быть может, милорд хочет возглавить нас? Сир Уэймар Ройс не потрудился ответить. Где-то вдалеке в лесу завыл волк. Уилл завел свою лошадь под ствол, древний и корявый, и спешился. – Почему ты остановился? – спросил сир Уэймар. – Остаток пути лучше пройти пешком, милорд. Место как раз за гребнем. Вглядываясь вдаль, Ройс помедлил, на мгновение остановившись в явной задумчивости. Холодный ветер прошелестел в деревьях, толстый меховой плащ рыцаря словно бы сам собой шевельнулся сзади. – Здесь что-то неладно, – пробормотал Гаред. Молодой рыцарь посмотрел на него с презрительной улыбкой: – В самом деле? – Неужели вы не ощущаете сами? – спросил Гаред. – Прислушайтесь к тьме. Уилл чувствовал это. За все четыре года, проведенных в Ночном Дозоре, ему никогда не приводилось так пугаться. Что это такое? – Дует ветер. Деревья шелестят. Волк воет. Какой звук лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? – Не дождавшись ответа, Ройс изящно выскользнул из седла. Он надежно привязал скакуна к низкому суку, чуть в стороне от остальных, и извлек из ножен длинный меч. На рукоятке блеснули самоцветы, лунный свет пробежал по сверкающей стали. Великолепное оружие, выкованное в замке, и не столь уж давно, если как следует приглядеться. Только вот едва ли им замахивались в гневе, решил Уилл. – Здесь всюду деревья, – предостерег Уилл. – Меч помешает вам, милорд. Лучше возьмите нож. – Если мне потребуются наставления, я попрошу их, – сказал молодой лорд. – Гаред, оставайся здесь. Охраняй коней. Гаред спешился. – Нам нужен огонь. Я разведу костер. – Какой же ты дурак, старик! Если по этому лесу бродят враги, значит, в огне мы нуждаемся в самую последнюю очередь. – Бывает, что врагов огонь удерживает в стороне, – проговорил Гаред. – Его боятся медведи и лютоволки… да и другие… Рот сира Уэймара сложился в прямую линию: – Никакого огня! Капюшон Гареда прикрыл лицо, но, поворачиваясь к рыцарю, Уилл заметил в глазах старика жесткий блеск. На миг он испугался, что Гаред достанет свой меч… короткая уродливая штуковина, рукоятка изъедена по́том, лезвие притуплено долгим употреблением… Уилл не дал бы железного шиллинга за жизнь лорденыша, если бы Гаред извлек свой клинок из ножен. Наконец Гаред поглядел вниз. – Никакого огня, – пробормотал он едва слышным голосом. Ройс принял это за подтверждение и отвернулся. – Ступай, – сказал он Уиллу. Уилл направился в чащу, потом вверх по склону к высокому гребню, где он обнаружил удобное место под страж-деревом. Тонкая корочка снега едва прикрывала грязь и влагу, ноги скользили – мешали камни и скрытые корни, – однако, поднимаясь, Уилл не произвел ни звука. За его спиной негромко позвякивал кольчугой лорденок, шелестели листья, раздавались негромкие ругательства, когда загребущие ветви цеплялись за длинный меч и за великолепный соболий плащ. Огромное страж-дерево находилось прямо на гребне; как помнил Уилл, нижние ветви его поднимались от земли почти на фут. Уилл скользнул под дерево, лег на живот в снег и грязь, поглядел на пустую поляну внизу, и сердце его провалилось в пятки. Мгновение он не смел дохнуть. Луна освещала поляну, кострище, занесенный снегом навес, огромную скалу, маленький узкий полузамерзший ручеек. Все это осталось неизменным – как и несколько часов назад. Но людей не было, все тела исчезли. – Ах, боги! – услышал он позади себя голос. Меч рубанул по ветке, и сир Уэймар Ройс поднялся на гребень. Он остановился возле страж-дерева с мечом в руках, ветер раздувал плащ, все вокруг могли видеть благородный силуэт на фоне звездного неба. – Немедленно вниз! – настоятельно шепнул Уилл. – Здесь что-то не так. Ройс не шевельнулся. Он поглядел на пустую прогалину и расхохотался: – Выходит, твои мертвецы куда-то перебрались. Голос Уилла предал его. Он искал слова и не находил их. Немыслимо! Глаза его метались взад и вперед по покинутому стану и остановились на топоре. Огромный боевой топор с двумя лезвиями все еще лежал на прежнем месте. Ценное оружие… – На ноги, Уилл, – приказал сир Уэймар. – Здесь никого нет. Я не хочу, чтобы ты прятался под кустом. Уилл нерешительно поднял голову. Сир Уэймар глядел на него с открытым неодобрением. – Я не намереваюсь вернуться в Черный замок с признанием о неудаче моей первой вылазки. Мы найдем этих людей. – Он огляделся. – Лезь на дерево. И быстро. Ищи огонь. Уилл молча отвернулся, спорить было бесполезно. Ветер менялся. Теперь порывы продували насквозь. Уилл подошел к дереву, высоко поднимавшему свои серо-зеленые ветви, и полез вверх. Скоро руки его запачкались смолой, и он почти потерялся среди иголок. Страх наполнил нутро Уилла комом непереваренной пищи. Прочитав молитву безымянным богам леса, он извлек свой кинжал из ножен и зажал в зубах, чтобы можно было держаться за дерево обеими руками. Вкус холодного железа во рту почему-то всегда успокаивал его. Лорденыш внизу вдруг воскликнул: – Кто идет? Уилл услышал неуверенность в его голосе и замер, прислушиваясь и наблюдая. Лес дал ответ: шелестели листья, в ледяном ложе бежал ручей, вдалеке кричала снежная сова. Иные не издают звуков. Уилл заметил движение уголком глаза. Бледные силуэты появились в лесу. Повернув голову, он увидел белую тень, скользнувшую во тьме. Тень исчезла. Ветки легко шевелились под ветром, скребли друг друга деревянными пальцами. Уилл открыл рот, чтобы выкрикнуть предупреждение, но слова как будто замерзли в его горле. Возможно, он ошибся, и это всего лишь птица или отражение, брошенное на снег прихотью лунного света. В конце концов, что он видел? – Уилл, где ты? – поднял голову вверх сир Уэймар. – Ты заметил что-нибудь? – Зажав в руке меч, рыцарь медленно, с внезапным напряжением повернулся на месте. Значит, и он ощутил их. Ощутил, но не увидел. – Отвечай мне! Почему так холодно? Было действительно холодно. Ежась, Уилл плотнее прижался к стволу, припав лицом к грубой коре. Сладко пахло смолой, прилипшей к щеке. Из тьмы леса родилась тень и остановилась перед Ройсом. Высокая, тощая и твердая, как старые кости, и вместе с тем бледная, как молоко. Панцирь ее словно менял цвет при каждом движении. Он то становился белым, как свежевыпавший снег, то покрывался угольной тенью, то отливал серой зеленью деревьев. С каждым шагом новый узор пробегал по броне, словно лунный свет по воде. Уилл услышал, как дыхание с долгим шипением вырвалось из груди сира Уэймара Ройса. – Стой! – выкрикнул лорденыш, дав петуха как мальчишка. Забросив длинный соболий плащ за плечи, он освободил обе руки для боя и взял меч. Ветер утих, но сделалось еще холоднее. Иной скользил вперед, бесшумно ступая; в руке существо держало длинный меч. Таких клинков Уилл никогда не видел. Ни один известный людям металл не мог бы пойти на это лезвие. Играя в лунном свете, меч казался прозрачной полоской тонкого хрусталя и почти исчезал, поворачиваясь плоскостью. Он горел призрачным голубым пламенем, и чутье поведало Уиллу, что более острого клинка ему еще не встречалось. – Ну что ж, попляшем и согреемся, – пробормотал сир Уэймар и занес свой меч над головой. Руки его дрожали от тяжести оружия или, может быть, от холода. И все же в тот момент Уилл увидел в нем не прежнего мальчика, но мужа из Ночного Дозора. Иной остановился, и Уилл заметил глаза существа: глубокая и густая нечеловеческая синева сверкала как лед. Они были обращены к длинному мечу, занесенному над головой, и лунный свет леденил металл. На миг Уилл потерял надежду. Они безмолвно возникали из теней двойниками первого. Их было трое… четверо… пятеро… Сир Уэймар, должно быть, ощущал холод, который принесли Иные, но не видел их, даже не слышал. Уиллу следовало бы крикнуть. Но, выполняя свой долг, он лишь навлек бы на себя несомненную смерть. Трепеща, Уилл только теснее обнял дерево, сохраняя молчание. Бледный меч холодом пронзил воздух. Сир Уэймар встретил удар сталью. Клинки соприкоснулись не со звоном металла о металл: в воздухе проплыл тонкий стон животного, получившего смертельную рану. Ройс отразил и второй удар, и третий, а затем отступил на шаг. Последовал еще поток ударов, и он снова отступил. Позади него, справа, слева, вокруг стояли терпеливые, безликие и безмолвные наблюдатели, текучие узоры на хрупкой броне делали их в лесу почти невидимыми. И все же они не пытались вмешаться. Вновь и вновь встречались мечи. Уиллу захотелось зажать уши, только бы не слышать этот странный болезненный визг. Сир Уэймар теперь пыхтел от натуги, дыхание паром струилось в лунном свете. Его клинок побелел от мороза. Иной же плясал вокруг с бледным голубым пламенем в руках. А потом удар Ройса чуть запоздал. Бледный меч прорезал его кольчугу на боку. Молодой лорд вскрикнул от боли. Кровь хлынула между колец. Она задымилась на холоде, красные как огонь капли падали на снег. Пальцы сира Уэймара зажали бок, на кротовой перчатке выступила кровь. Иной что-то сказал: языка Уилл не знал, голос чужака трещал словно лед на зимнем озере, но в словах слышалась насмешка. К сиру Уэймару вновь вернулась ярость. – За короля Роберта! – закричал он и отчаянно бросился вперед, обеими руками занес покрытый изморозью меч и рубанул им сбоку, вложив в удар вес всего тела. Иной ответил небрежным ленивым движением. Клинки соприкоснулись, и сталь разбилась. С визгом, отозвавшимся в ночном лесу, длинный меч рассыпался на сотню хрупких иголок, дождем разлетевшихся вокруг. Ройс упал на колени, с криком прижимая руку к глазам. Кровь проступала между его пальцев. Безмолвные наблюдатели разом шагнули вперед, словно получив какой-то сигнал. Мечи поднимались и падали в смертельном безмолвии. Началась хладнокровная бойня. Бледные клинки прорезали кольчугу, словно какой-то шелк. Уилл закрыл глаза. Голоса их и смех, колючий словно сосульки, раздавались где-то под ним. Не скоро он накопил достаточно отваги, чтобы поглядеть вниз, даже когда гребень уже опустел. Едва смея дышать, Уилл еще долго оставался на дереве, и луна медленно ползла по черному небу. Наконец мышцы его окоченели, пальцы онемели от холода, и он стал спускаться. Тело Ройса лежало лицом в снег, одна рука была протянута в сторону, толстый соболий плащ прорезан в дюжине мест. Было видно, насколько он молод. Мальчишка. Уилл нашел остатки меча чуть в стороне: клинок расщепился и изогнулся, напоминая дерево, пораженное ударом молнии. Став на колени, Уилл осторожно огляделся вокруг и подобрал оружие. Расщепленный клинок послужит доказательством его слов. Гаред знает, что все это значит, а если нет, то поймет старый медведь Мормонт или мейстер Эйемон. Ждет ли его еще Гаред с лошадьми? Надо торопиться. Уилл поднялся. Над ним высился сир Уэймар Ройс. Тонкие одежды разодраны, лицо разбито. Осколок торчал из ослепленной левой глазницы. Правый глаз был открыт. Зрачок его горел синим огнем и… видел. Сломанный меч упал из бесчувственных пальцев. Уилл закрыл глаза, чтобы помолиться. Длинные благородные пальцы коснулись его щеки, стиснули горло. Уилл ощутил прикосновение тончайшей выделки кротовой кожи, липкой от крови. Но прикосновение оказалось ледяным. Текст 2: Пролог В городе, который некогда назывался Кабитэла, а ныне — Оллария, цвела сирень. Ее белые и лиловые свечи, как и положено горящим свечам, были обречены. Обречены были и воркующие на крышах голуби, и суетящиеся на улицах люди, и сам этот мир, но неизбежность конца придавала весеннему городу некое горькое очарование. Трудно любить то, что всегда было и всегда будет, зато осознание того, что «это в последний раз», оживляет притупившиеся чувства, и ты замечаешь вещи, которые раньше не замечал, и сердце твое разрывается от любви и боли. Одинокий в последний раз шел улицами Олларии — этот мир становился опасен. Скоро старая, добрая Кэртиана будет вотчиной раттонов, пройдет еще несколько веков, и то, во что превратится некогда вольный и радостный мир, придется уничтожить. Из великого Ожерелья выпадет еще одна бусина — не столь уж и страшная потеря, ведь сама Нить уцелеет. Шедший цветущим городом гость понимал, что беда случится не завтра. То, что для него было «скоро», для смертных означало почти «никогда». Люди, спешащие по своим делам и странным образом не замечающие высокого чужака, успеют долюбить, досуетиться, доненавидеть, равно, как и их дети, внуки и правнуки. И все равно Одинокому было мучительно жаль исполненный жизни город с его каштанами и сиренью, щебечущими скворцами, красными черепичными крышами и булыжными мостовыми. Люди… Одинокий усмехнулся — он ведь тоже БЫЛ человеком. Был, пока не прошел Костры Этерны. Его никто не вынуждал — в пламя Этерны нельзя ни столкнуть, ни заманить. Он сам выбрал свою судьбу, согласившись умереть, чтоб воскреснуть Стражем Заката, вечным воином и странником, давшим клятву хранить Ожерелье. Одинокий не знал, как и где начался его путь, — Нить длинна, а его память сгорела в вихре лилового огня, огня цвета увядающей сирени. Нет, он ни в чем не раскаивался и ни о чем не жалел, — бесконечный бой, в котором не может быть победы, стал его прошлым, настоящим и будущим, не оставив места для сомнений и тоски, но в некоторых мирах страннику хотелось задержаться. Одинокий полагал, что эти миры чем-то напоминали его прежнюю родину, но чем — не знал и не мог знать. Все, что случилось до того, как будущий Страж Заката шагнул в лиловый костер и адская боль разорвала в клочья сознание, исчезло. Это было разумно — прошлое имеет над нами слишком большую власть. Те, кто держит на плечах небо, должны быть свободны от былых привязанностей и долгов, но весенняя Кэртиана пьянила и печалила. Может, все дело было в цветущих каштанах и сирени, а может, в чужих улыбках или в стремительных острокрылых ласточках… Одинокий протянул руку, и могучий каштан медленно склонил ветви навстречу чужаку. Сильные пальцы легко коснулись цветочной грозди, и путник чему-то улыбнулся, по-кошачьи сощурившись. Он мог обернуться стариком, юношей, женщиной, леопардом, драконом, наконец, но предпочитал оставаться самим собой. Внешность — единственное, что оставил ему лиловый огонь. Страж Заката надеялся, что кто-то когда-то любил его именно таким. Или ненавидел. Одинокий не сомневался, что всегда был воином, но все остальное… Было ли ему что терять? Хотелось верить, что было. Иногда он пытался придумать себе человеческое прошлое, счастье, от которого отказался, последовав за позвавшей его адой, но выдумки или таяли, как облака, или жгли, как раскаленное железо. Вечный воин, он сочинял сказки о великой любви и преданной дружбе, а они не сочинялись. Он видел себя умирающим от удара в спину, ожидающим пыток и казни, скитающимся в чужих краях, идущим сквозь чужую зависть, злобу, презрение, но не счастливым. Отчего-то казалось, что в его жизни ненависти было больше, чем любви, а боли больше, чем радости, и все равно Одинокий предпочел бы помнить все. Колокольный перезвон вернул странника на землю Кэртианы. Смертные всегда и всюду просят небожителей о милости, не зная, что боги погибли, а те, кто принял их ношу, не имеют ни сил, ни возможности снисходить к человеческим просьбам. Чуждое не оставляет попыток поглотить Ожерелье, а противостоят растущему напору лишь Одинокие. Их дело — сражаться, и, пока они бьются, смертным отвечают раттоны, будь они трижды прокляты! Одинокий отпустил ветку и двинулся дальше, смешавшись с изливающимся из храма людским потоком. Его не замечали, не «не видели», а именно не замечали, зато он замечал все, — ведь он видел Кэртиану в последний раз, Кэртиану, которая тысячи лет была его «поляной в лесу», местом, к которому тянулось его сердце. Залечив раны и набравшись сил, он прежде, чем вернуться в бой, проходил через этот мир, запоминая женский смех и детские крики. Одинокий не создавал Кэртиану и не был ею создан, но ему хотелось любить, и он полюбил этот мир и, защищая Ожерелье, защищал в первую очередь его. Кэртиана жила и дышала за его спиной, так было, но так больше не будет. Он не вправе позволить раттонам отыскать свои следы — Осень слишком драгоценна, чтобы рисковать ею. Осень дороже Кэртианы, а Ожерелье дороже одной из бусин. Когда Этерна была цела, они сражались за каждый из миров Ожерелья. Теперешних сил едва хватает, чтобы сдерживать Чуждое на Новом Рубеже. Раньше Одинокие вмешивались в дела смертных, называвших их кто богами, кто демонами, теперь в прошлом и это. В прошлом все, кроме боя. Когда падет последний защитник, придет конец и Ожерелью, только раттонам этого не понять. Они вообще мало что понимают, эти возомнившие себя богами ничтожества. Играя в свои игры, они подгрызают Нить, невольно помогая тому или тем, кто рвется к ней снаружи. Теперь они подняли голову и в Кэртиане. Одинокий медленно шел по залитым солнцем улицам, наслаждаясь тем, что ступает по твердой земле, дышит полной грудью, видит цветы и улыбки. Грязь, старость, несправедливость никуда не исчезли, но он старался не думать о них, так же как и о раттонах. Твари еще не вошли в полную силу, Кэртиана не знает, что смертельно больна, и в этом ее счастье. Если б он мог задержаться! Но каждый должен делать то, что за него не сделает никто. Место Одинокого — его бой на Рубеже. Внутренние Миры выживают или погибают сами и по своей вине. Смертные наделены волей и разумом, они могут и должны дать отпор раттонам, а не идти у них на поводу, но как им это объяснишь?! Он несколько раз пробовал говорить с людьми — его не понимали. Улица заканчивалась у старинной стены, к которой лепились торговые ряды. Оллария поглотила старую Кабитэлу. Новое или поглощает старое, или убивает. Когда-то здесь расстилались ржаные поля, которые топтали воины Франциска Оллара, бастарда, пожелавшего стать великим королем и ставшего им. Губы Одинокого скривились в усмешке. Откуда у него привычка улыбаться и даже смеяться, когда на сердце особенно мерзко, Страж Заката не знал. Возможно, это тень его старой жизни. Магия Этерны была сильна, но даже она не уничтожила всего. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но его притягивали или, наоборот, отталкивали некоторые звуки, запахи, лица. Вот и тот рыцарь, которому он сказал, что совесть выше и чести, и закона, почему он заговорил именно с ним? Сколько лет прошло! Почему ему до сих пор больно вспоминать, чем все закончилось? Кэртианца давным-давно нет на свете, а Одинокий все ищет для него слова и доводы, ищет и не находит. И все равно случившееся тогда отобрало у раттонов несколько веков. Для Ожерелья — миг, для Кэртианы — жизнь восьми или десяти поколений. Жаль только, что тот, кто подарил своему миру четыреста лет свободы, не дождался ни благодарности, ни понимания… Толпившиеся на улице горожане расступились, пропуская красивого всадника на породистой вороной кобыле, и Одинокий невольно залюбовался. Человек был счастлив, как может быть счастлив лишь… человек, живущий единым, сверкающим мигом. Он любил и был любим — Одинокий понял это сразу. Захваченный волной чужой радости, странник не сразу почуял приглушенную ненависть. За влюбленным следили. Кто? Соперник? Муж? Или эта злоба не имеет ничего общего с чужим счастьем? Похоже на то, уж больно она холодна и расчетлива. Страж Заката пожал плечами, мысленно пожелав неведомому всаднику избежать удара в спину, и сразу же забыл и о нем, и о его враге. Этот вечер принадлежал ему, и он хотел провести его так, словно сам был плотью от плоти этого мира. Ожерелье, Рубеж, бой без надежды и без конца — все это нет, не исчезло, но словно бы отодвинулось. Одинокий чувствовал себя свободным и смертным, он даже позволил себе зайти в таверну и сесть в углу, куда немедленно принесли кувшин с вином, после чего никто и не подумал взглянуть в сторону странного посетителя. Люди приходили и уходили, а Одинокий смотрел на них — пьющих, смеющихся, поющих… Откуда-то вылезла маленькая пятнистая кошка, почти котенок, и остановилась, нерешительно глядя на гостя. Кошка — не человек, ей глаза не отведешь. Эти маленькие вольные твари не только чуют всех, владеющих магией, но и сами ей сопричастны, потому-то раттоны их и ненавидят. И ненависть эта взаимна. Если кошек начинают гнать, проклинать, называть нечистыми, предавшимися злу тварями, ищи поблизости раттонов. Одинокий поднял бровь, и кошка, расценив это как приглашение, прыгнула ему на колени. В зверьке билась магическая искра, маленькая и слабая, но отчетливая. Кошки понимают, что ждет Кэртиану. Кошки, но не люди. Воин успел застать создателей этого мира. Их было четверо, и они откликнулись на призыв Этерны и ушли на Рубеж, поручив Кэртиану своим избранникам из числа смертных. Человеческой памяти хватило на три тысячи лет. Не так уж и мало, если вспомнить, что люди редко живут дольше семидесяти… Правнукам нынешних гуляк придется туго — раттоны убивают чужую радость, может быть, потому, что сами на нее не способны. Зависть, злоба, страх — это да, это по ним, но радости этим существам не отпущено. Только злорадство. Возможно, их стоит пожалеть, но Одинокий, если б мог, перебил их всех. Если б мог… Здешним обитателям и не снилась мощь, которой он обладал. Страж Заката мог уничтожить Кэртиану и боялся, что испить эту чашу доведется именно ему. В его власти уничтожить, но не спасти. Как легко сжечь зачумленный город и этим остановить заразу, но кто возьмется одолеть беду, выловив всех чумных крыс? А раттоны — чумные крысы Ожерелья, их становится все больше, а Одиноких все меньше! Кошка, почуяв его ярость, вздрогнула и прижала уши. Она знала, как сражаться с крысами, если б ее сородичи были покрупнее и посильнее, если б их удалось объединить и натравить на этих, с позволения сказать, новых владык, но увы! Страж Заката взял кубок и поднес к кошачьей морде. Зверушка брезгливо сморщила нос и отодвинулась. Пробовать вино она не собиралась, и Одинокий выпил сам. В память первых богов Кэртианы! Они были готовы умереть на Рубеже, а смерть настигла их в Этерне, казавшейся самым безопасным местом Ожерелья. Тогда погибли многие и вместе с ними погибла надежда. Одинокий залпом допил вино, словно ему, теперешнему, это могло помочь. Вечер продолжался. Играла музыка, танцевала черноволосая девушка в алой, низко вырезанной блузке, а он видел шар ревущего пламени, чудовищную звезду, родившуюся из гибели Этерны. Нет, это было потом, конь его судьбы свернул с общей дороги раньше. …Они стояли под серебристым мертвым небом без солнца и птиц, а Пепельное море лениво переливало у их ног тяжелые, медленные волны. Казалось, Чуждое устало рваться вперед, его напор ослабел. Уходившие в Этерну шутили, что отдыхать можно и на Рубеже, и они готовы остаться. Потом камни на мечах вспыхнули лиловыми звездами, предупреждая о том, что Чуждое шевельнулось. Приближался бой — один из множества, — ничего выдающегося, сколько таких было, и сколько еще будет. Горизонт набухал похожими на гарадских итаров тучами, предвещая бурю, которую предстояло остановить. Шторм надвигался медленно и неотвратимо, нападавшие и обороняющие в тысячный раз готовились помериться силами, заранее зная, что они равны. Стратег остающихся нехорошо улыбнулся, приветствуя подползавшего врага, небо стало ниже, море с шумом отступало, обнажая скалистое дно. Ни водорослей, ни раковин, ни бьющейся на мели рыбы. Только серый, отливающий сталью камень… — Нам пора, — Одинокий забыл, кто произнес эти слова, — это не наш бой. Бой и вправду был не их. Они сделали свое дело и могли возвращаться в Этерну, но он избрал другую дорогу. Дворец Архонта с его вечными празднествами в честь вернувшихся с Рубежа и уходящих на Рубеж был хорош, но Одинокий не любил пиров, можно даже сказать, ненавидел. Видимо, это тоже выползло из его убитого прошлого. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но каждая поднятая в высоких чертогах чаша отзывалась в сердце звериной тоской. Одинокий любил своих товарищей, любовался адами, верил Архонту и Стратегам, но их буйное веселье было не по нему. Похоже, он стал Одиноким до того, как это слово сорвалось с губ последней уцелевшей ады. Как бы то ни было, ненависть к пирам его и спасла. Убегая от ненавистной радости, он забрел сюда, в Кэртиану, где его и застиг зов. Рубеж просил помощи, и было некогда думать, что там происходит. Он бросился назад… Одинокий с силой сжал пустой кубок, вспоминая непосильную тяжесть, словно ему, как герою легенды, и впрямь пришлось взвалить на плечи небесный свод. Рядом кто-то упал, груз стал еще неподъемней, он стиснул зубы, заставляя себя держаться. Сгоревшие Миры, по которым пролегал Рубеж, были мертвы, их можно было оставить без особого риска, но, единожды отступив, отступишь снова, и он держался, они все держались… Чуждое наконец схлынуло, как всегда, рассыпавшись стаей странных, смертных созданий, на сей раз похожих на летучих медуз. Полупрозрачная мерзость сама бросалась на мечи, словно желая побыстрее со всем покончить. Одинокому показалось, что бой длился дольше, чем обычно, но, возможно, он просто устал. — В Этерне решили, что мы испугались собственной тени? — недовольно бросил бившийся рядом Стратег, разрубая слизистый гриб. — Я не был там. — Одинокий отшвырнул студенистое полушарие. — Не понимаю. Нас не услышали? Или что-то стряслось в самой Этерне? Тогда это показалось бредом. Что могло стрястись в месте, исполненном великой Силы, покорной Архонту и его сподвижникам? Нет, это невиданная доселе схватка приглушила Зов, и он не достиг цели. — Как бы то ни было, я должен говорить с Архонтом, — бросил Стратег, оглядывая из-под руки серебристый горизонт, — и я буду говорить с ним. Поговорить с Архонтом Стратегу не удалось — Этерны больше не существовало. Что именно произошло, уцелевшие так никогда и не узнали. Был ли это заговор, неосторожность, несчастливая случайность или же сработал доселе неведомый закон мироздания, но произошло то, что произошло. Те, кого в час беды не оказалось в Этерне, собрались на Рубеже. Их было больше, чем они боялись, и меньше, чем надеялись. Выжившие могли держать Рубеж, но не создавать миры и не одаривать избранных бессмертием и силой. Одинокий навеки запомнил глаза Стратега — исполненные боли и тревоги глаза воина, осознавшего, что ему не дождаться ни помощи, ни приказа, что все смотрят на него и отныне от него зависит исход войны… Стратег стал Архонтом, а все они — Одинокими, не загадывавшими дальше грядущей схватки. Рано или поздно Чуждое прорвет оборону и набросится на внутренние миры, впрочем, в последнее время Одинокий стал опасаться, что раттоны погубят Ожерелье прежде, чем падет Рубеж. …Крик был неожиданным и страшным. Это не было зовом в прямом смысле этого слова, но Одинокий вскочил, сбросив на пол раздосадованную кошку. Неподалеку шел неравный бой — кто-то в одиночку отбивался от множества убийц. Страж Заката чувствовал их ярость, удивление и, наконец, страх. Тот, на кого напали, был обречен, но он дрался и как дрался! Одинокий словно бы вживую увидел большую, тускло освещенную комнату, опрокинутую, разбитую мебель, мечущиеся силуэты, чьи-то глаза, белые от ярости… Странно, он ведь отгородился от чужих мыслей и чувств, и отгородился надежно, в чем же дело? Раттоны? Нет, тут они ни при чем. Страж Заката, по-прежнему никем не примеченный, выбежал на улицу. Город спал или делал вид, что спит, было тихо, но Одинокий не сомневался — рядом убивают. Более того, он знал, кого именно — всадника, встреченного им на площади. Те, кто за ним следил, времени зря не теряли. Где-то завыла собака, хлопнула дверь, в окне напротив задули свечу. Воин пожал плечами и быстро пошел по пустынному переулку. Зачем ему это? Люди вечно враждуют, а если не могут справиться с противником в открытом бою, бьют в спину. Кэртиана не исключение, скоро здесь и вовсе начнется война всех со всеми. Война, в которой не будет победителей, кроме раттонов. Переулок влился в тихую улицу, застроенную двухэтажными домами; в одном из них погибал человек, чья неистовая радость разбудила в Одиноком то, что, казалось, ушло навсегда. Между ним и смертным возникла ниточка, которая и привела чужака к изящному особняку, в котором шел бой. Шел, хотя должен был уже закончиться. Жалобно зазвенело разбитое окно, сквозь которое пролетел какой-то обломок, раздался крик, и ответом ему был наглухо захлопнувшийся ставень в доме напротив. Эта «хата» явно была «с краю». Снова звон, злобный вопль, глухие удары и возня внутри и мертвая тишина снаружи. Как похоже на людей… Остатки здравого смысла шептали, уговаривали, требовали оставить все, как есть. Одинокие не вмешиваются в дела смертных, Кэртиана захвачена раттонами, он не должен оставлять следов… Он их и не оставит! Зачем тратить Силу, ведь он может драться, как человек! Он это умеет, всегда умел, и будь трижды прокляты все раттоны всех миров и все запреты! Одинокий выхватил меч и пинком вышиб жалобно вскрикнувшую дверь. Текст 3: Пролог «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой...","output":"Сравним эти тексты по предложенным пунктам: 1.

Thompson and later adapted into a film, is an iconic depiction of the drug-fueled, countercultural excess of the late 60s and early 70s. It\'s known for its surreal and satirical portrayal of the American Dream, seen through the lens of an outrageous road trip. The story is set primarily in Las Vegas, a city symbolic of American excess and hedonism. As for your story that is inspired by this work, I\'m very interested to hear about the setting you have created. Are you maintaining the Las Vegas backdrop or transplanting the themes to a new location? How are you infusing the original\'s spirit of gonzo journalism and critique of American society into your narrative? Feel free to provide details about the era, the physical landscape, and the cultural environment where your story takes place."},{"instruction":"The setting is in Miami around 2012. It\'s summer, the heat is nearly UNBEARABLE and it\'s a perfect time for our 2 main characters to go on vacation, get high, get drunk and write for a magazine.","output":"Transporting the essence of \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" to Miami in 2012 offers a fresh perspective while still providing a fertile ground for exploring excess and escapism. Miami, much like Vegas, is known for its vibrant nightlife, picturesque beaches, and a certain degree of hedonistic culture, which could serve as a perfect backdrop for your characters\' wild journey. Here\'s a brief setting overview based on your description, with some potential elements you could incorporate: **Miami, Summer 2012:** - **The Heat:** The stifling summer heat in Miami is more than just a weather condition; it can be a character in its own right. It influences the behavior of people, pushes the protagonists to seek relief in various forms—whether that be the coolness of a nightclub or the refreshment of an alcoholic beverage—and can add to the overall sense of discomfort and delirium that complements the drug-induced experiences of your characters. - **The City’s Atmosphere:** Miami\'s cultural diversity molds much of the city\'s character. Its strong Cuban and Latino influences can be felt in everything from the food to the music, establishing a distinct beat for your narrative. The art scene, including the famous Art Basel Miami Beach, which began in 2002, could also provide an interesting backdrop for your characters if they delve into the arts while on their escapades. - **The Magazine Scene:** The media and magazine industries have had to adapt rapidly in the face of digitization and social media, which were becoming increasingly significant in 2012. Your characters\' assignments could reflect the tension between traditional journalism and the rise of digital culture. Their writing could either be a desperate grab for relevance in a changing industry or an avant-garde statement that captures the zeitgeist of the early 2010s. - **The Nightlife:** While Las Vegas has casinos and endless gambling opportunities, Miami offers nightclubs, extravagant party scenes, and beach raves. The nightlife in Miami could serve as an alternative parallel to Vegas’ casinos: places where the characters escape reality, encounter a myriad of unique individuals, and dive deeper into substance abuse and philosophical musings. - **The Economic Climate:** In 2012, America was still grappling with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Your characters might encounter the contrasts of opulent wealth displayed in Miami’s luxury districts alongside areas still reeling from economic hardship. This can add a layer of social commentary to your story. **Themes and Motifs:** - **Excess and Hedonism:** Similar to Thompson\'s work, your characters can indulge in extremes of pleasure-seeking behavior, using the intoxicating environment of Miami as a means to explore their personal freedoms—or as an escape from reality. - **The Search for the American Dream:** While the original work often satirized the pursuit of the American Dream, your setting could reflect on how the concept has evolved or remained stagnant by the 2010s. This exploration can be especially poignant in the context of post-recession America. - **Disillusionment with Society:** A modern rendition could provide a critique of the changes (or lack thereof) in American culture and values, once again highlighting the countercultural perspectives and feelings of disenfranchisement with mainstream society. Incorporating elements like smartphones, social media, the political climate of the time, and the specific local issues of Miami could help ground your tale in 2012, giving it a unique identity while honoring the rebellious spirit of \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\\""},{"instruction":"Our two main characters are named Ryan Thompson, a recent high school graduate doing this magazine thing for a quick buck and Frank Tanner, a magazine writer from Texas who\'s going to Miami to write on a car rally for a car magazine. They are going there in a, \\"Big Blue Steed\\" aka a 2005 Ford Mustang.","output":"The dynamic between Ryan Thompson and Frank Tanner brings together a fresh-out-of-high-school kid with a possibly jaded magazine writer in a situation ripe for a transformative journey. Here\'s an outline of their situational dynamics and how your setting could enhance their story: **Character Dynamics:** - **Ryan Thompson:** As a recent high school graduate, Ryan is at the cusp of adult life, potentially filled with idealism and eager to experience the world. He might view the trip to Miami as a rite of passage. His interactions with Frank and exposure to the intensity of Miami\'s lifestyle could deeply impact his worldviews. His motivations for doing the magazine job for quick money might open doors to discussions about the economic realities facing young adults in the post-recession era. - **Frank Tanner:** Hailing from Texas and with an established career, Frank likely has set opinions and experiences that contrast with Ryan\'s. He could offer a more cynical view of the industry they\'re entering and perhaps have his own reasons for escaping to Miami, which might be revealed over the course of the story. Frank\'s assignment at the car rally could also provide an interesting window into the world of luxury and performance vehicles, a different kind of excess compared to Vegas\' gambling scene. **The \\"Big Blue Steed\\" - 2005 Ford Mustang:** - The choice of a Ford Mustang as their vehicle — with its iconic status in American culture as a symbol of freedom, power, and rebellion — is ideal for a journey reminiscent of \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\\" The Mustang could serve as a metaphorical \'steed\' that carries our mismatched protagonists on their modern quest for meaning in a society that provides pleasure but lacks substance. **Setting Incorporations:** - **The Car Rally:** The car rally that Frank needs to report on can be a centerpiece event around which the story unfolds. It could provide an insider\'s look into the world of high-performance vehicles, the type of people drawn to such events, and the culture surrounding it. The rally itself could have stages or be spread out over multiple locations in and around Miami, giving the characters opportunities to explore different aspects of the city. - **Miami as a Canvas:** The Miami setting in 2012 gives you the opportunity to showcase the city not only through its party scene but also as a melting pot of cultures, ideas, and social statuses. As Ryan and Frank traverse different neighborhoods, they might encounter the wealth disparity, the impact of the housing crisis, the influence of drug culture, or the vibrant street art scene. **Thematic Elements:** - **Exploration of Youth and Experience:** The interplay between young Ryan and more experienced Frank can be a vessel to explore themes such as the naivety of youth, the disenchantment of age, and the possibility for personal growth or degeneration that such a trip could bring. - **Personal and Social Commentary:** Through the lens of a car magazine assignment, the story can critique or comment on consumer culture, the status symbols of American life, and the contrasts between practicality and luxury. It may also touch on the pursuit of happiness through material means. - **Juxtaposition of Generations:** The differences between Ryan and Frank\'s generations could offer perspectives on shifting values and life goals, creating a dialogue between past and present views on work, success, and fulfillment. - **The Journey Itself as Transformation:** Like the original \\"Fear and Loathing,\\" the physical journey can mirror the internal transformation of the characters. Challenges they face, people they meet, and situations they get into can all serve as catalysts for personal revelations or changes. Your modern-day incarnation of the journey into the American Dream could thus be a story of discovery and introspection, set against the pulsing ambiance of Miami – a setting where the heat, like the pressure of society, is nearly unbearable, and the only respite is found in the fleeting excesses that the city has to offer. Through this lens, the \\"Big Blue Steed\\" doesn\'t just transport Ryan and Frank geographically but also takes them on a wild ride through the landscapes of their own psyches."},{"instruction":"Tell us some basic information about radio waves: 1. What materials reflect or absorb radio waves, and what determines the quality of reflection. 2. Sky wave effect 3. Does a Faraday cage reflect or absorb radio waves? 4. What is the difference in operation when the Faraday cage is grounded or not grounded? 5. Quality Wave penetration depending on frequency. 6. Selection of the cell size of the Faraday cage depending on the wavelength (size of the hole in the screen) 7. The influence of the thickness of the Faraday grid conductor on reflection and absorption 8. Why is a static electric field not reflected? 9. Can a Faraday grid be used in a reflective antenna? At what distance should the antenna and parabolic screen be placed from each other depending on the wavelength? What diameter (size) should a parabolic reflector be based on wavelength? Answer questions briefly and meaningfully on the topic. Without unnecessary and unimportant information","output":"1. **Materials Reflecting or Absorbing Radio Waves:** - *Reflective:* Conductive materials like metals (aluminum, copper) reflect radio waves. The quality of reflection is determined by the material\'s conductivity and the smoothness of its surface relative to the wavelength of the radio waves. - *Absorptive:* Materials with high dielectric losses, like water or certain building materials (like brick or concrete), absorb radio waves. The amount of absorption is affected by the material\'s dielectric properties and thickness. 2. **Sky Wave Effect:** - The sky wave effect is observed when radio waves are refracted back towards the Earth by the ionosphere, allowing for long-distance communication over the horizon. This effect is more pronounced at lower frequencies (HF or high frequency band). 3. **Faraday Cage Effect on Radio Waves:** - A Faraday cage can both reflect and absorb radio waves depending on the construction. It mainly works by shielding its interior from external electric field changes, including radio waves. 4. **Grounded vs. Non-Grounded Faraday Cage:** - When grounded, a Faraday cage can drain intercepted electrical charges more effectively, leading to better protection against electromagnetic fields. An ungrounded cage can still provide shielding, but may not be as effective against low-frequency electric fields. 5. **Wave Penetration Depending on Frequency:** - Lower frequency radio waves tend to penetrate materials better than higher-frequency waves. Higher frequencies are more likely to be absorbed or reflected. 6. **Cell Size of Faraday Cage:** - The size of the holes in the mesh of a Faraday cage should be significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radio waves to be blocked to ensure effective shielding. For instance, if the cage is meant to block a 1 GHz signal with a wavelength of about 30 cm (300 mm), the openings should be smaller than 30 mm. 7. **Influence of Faraday Grid Conductor Thickness:** - Increased thickness can improve reflection due to greater electron density and potential for induced currents, thus providing a better shield against the penetration of radio waves. 8. **Non-reflection of Static Electric Fields:** - A static electric field is not reflected because it does not have a time-varying component, which is needed to induce current in a conductive surface that would then radiate or reflect the field. 9. **Faraday Grid in Reflective Antennas:** - A Faraday grid can be used as part of a feed system for a parabolic reflector antenna. The distance between the antenna and the parabolic screen (focal length) is determined by the parabola\'s geometry, typically a fraction of the dish diameter allowing the feed antenna to be placed at its focal point. The diameter of the parabolic reflector should be many times larger than the wavelength to ensure a narrow beamwidth and high gain; generally, a size of at least several wavelengths is required for effective operation."},{"instruction":"Soy novato en inglés, explícame todo lo necesario que debo saber para entender la palabra \\"plunge\\", cuando digo todo es TODO, abarca toda la cantidad posible de información necesaria así como recursos, usa lenguaje sencillo y ejemplos y traducciones prácticas para un principiante","output":"¡Claro!

Could you help me publishing it as a bioconda package?","output":"Publishing your tool \\"gtfsort\\" as a Bioconda package involves several steps. Since Bioconda is specifically targeted towards bioinformatics software, make sure your tool is appropriate for the repository. Here\'s a general process you can follow: 1. **Write a Conda Recipe:** You\'ll need to create a Conda recipe for your tool. This is like a set of instructions that tells Conda how to build and install the package. A basic recipe includes these files: - `meta.yaml`: Contains package metadata, like the name, version, source URL, dependencies, etc. - `build.sh`: A shell script for Unix-like systems that is run during the build step. This script typically contains commands to compile the software or perform any necessary pre-installation steps. - `bld.bat`: A batch file for Windows builds, if applicable. 2. **Test Your Recipe Locally:** Before submitting your recipe to Bioconda, it\'s best to test it locally using the `conda-build` command. This ensures that the build process completes successfully on your own system. ``` conda-build recipes/gtfsort ``` You may need to resolve any build errors or missing dependencies by adjusting the recipe accordingly. 3. **Fork the Bioconda Recipes Repository:** Bioconda packages are contributed through the Bioconda recipes repository on GitHub. Fork the repository to your own account. 4. **Add Your Recipe:** Clone your forked repository and add your `gtfsort` recipe to the `recipes` folder. Make sure to follow any naming conventions and directory structures as required by Bioconda. 5. **Push to GitHub and Open a Pull Request (PR):** Once you\'ve added the recipe to your fork, push the changes to your GitHub repository and then open a PR against the original Bioconda repository. The PR will trigger automated continuous integration tests that will build your package on multiple platforms. 6. **Review Process:** The Bioconda community will review your pull request. You might receive feedback to adjust your recipe or clarify any questions. If any further changes are needed, make them in your local recipe, push to your fork, and the PR will update automatically. 7. **Merge and Availability:** Once the PR is approved and merged, the Bioconda bot will build and deploy your package to the Bioconda channel. Your `gtfsort` tool will then be available for users to install via `conda install`. 8. **Maintenance:** Remember that as the author, you\'ll be responsible for updating the recipe for any future releases or bug fixes. Make sure to follow the Bioconda guidelines outlined in their documentation. The above steps provide a high-level overview, but the actual process may involve specific details based on your tool\'s requirements. For a more detailed and updated guide, refer to the [Bioconda contribution documentation](https://bioconda.github.io/contributor/index.html)."},{"instruction":"could explain me this; # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 FROM rust:1.74.0-bullseye AS builder COPY .git /app/.git COPY Cargo.lock Cargo.toml /app/ COPY src/ /app/src/ RUN cargo build --release --manifest-path /app/Cargo.toml FROM debian:bullseye COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/fq /usr/local/bin/ ENTRYPOINT [\\"/usr/local/bin/fq\\"]","output":"Certainly! The text you\'ve provided appears to be a Dockerfile, which is a script used by Docker to automate the process of building a Docker image. I\'ll explain each line and section of your Dockerfile: ```Dockerfile # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 ``` This line specifies the syntax that the Dockerfile will use. It\'s declaring that it will use the first version of the Dockerfile syntax during the Docker build process. ```Dockerfile FROM rust:1.74.0-bullseye AS builder ``` This line is specifying the base image for the first stage of a multi-stage build. It\'s using an image that includes the Rust programming environment, version 1.74.0, based on Debian Bullseye. This stage is given the name \'builder\' so it can be referenced later. ```Dockerfile COPY .git /app/.git COPY Cargo.lock Cargo.toml /app/ COPY src/ /app/src/ ``` These lines are copying files and directories into the image. The `.git` directory, `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml` files, and the `src/` directory are being copied into `/app/` in the image. These are likely the source files needed to compile the Rust project. ```Dockerfile RUN cargo build --release --manifest-path /app/Cargo.toml ``` This line is running the `cargo build` command within the Docker container. Cargo is Rust\'s package manager and build tool. The `--release` flag builds the application with optimizations. The `--manifest-path` option tells Cargo where the `Cargo.toml` file (which specifies the package\'s dependencies) is located. ```Dockerfile FROM debian:bullseye ``` This line starts the second stage of the multi-stage build, and it\'s using `debian:bullseye` as the base image. This is generally a smaller and simpler image since it doesn\'t include the Rust build environment. ```Dockerfile COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/fq /usr/local/bin/ ``` This line is copying the compiled binary `fq` from the `builder` stage (`/app/target/release/fq`) into the `usr/local/bin/` directory of the new stage. This means that the binary will be in the `PATH` and can be run directly by name. ```Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT [\\"/usr/local/bin/fq\\"] ``` Finally, this line sets the entry point for the container, which is the command that will be run when the Docker container starts. In this case, when the container starts, it will execute the `fq` binary. Please note that the name of the compiled binary is `fq` in the Dockerfile you\'ve shared – if your tool is named `gtfsort` as mentioned earlier, you\'ll want to update the paths accordingly, for example: ```Dockerfile COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/gtfsort /usr/local/bin/ ENTRYPOINT [\\"/usr/local/bin/gtfsort\\"] ``` This way, when you build this Docker image and run a container from it, your `gtfsort` application will start automatically."},{"instruction":"ok after changing the name, how can I test this?","output":"After changing the name in the Dockerfile to correspond to your application, you can test it by building and running a Docker container. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can do it: 1. **Build the Docker Image** Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile, then build the Docker image using the `docker build` command. Replace `<image_name>` with the name you want to give your Docker image: ``` docker build -t <image_name> . ``` Don\'t forget the period at the end of the command; it specifies the current directory as the build context. 2. **Run the Docker Container** Once the image is built, you can create and start a container from that image. Replace `<image_name>` with the name you used in the build step: ``` docker run --name <container_name> <image_name> ``` You can also add options to the `docker run` command to further control the container\'s behavior—such as mapping ports or mounting volumes. If your application has a command-line interface and you want to interact with it, you may want to use `-it` flags (interactive mode with a pseudo TTY), like this: ``` docker run -it --name <container_name> <image_name> ``` 3. **Interact with the Application** If your application requires interaction or command-line arguments, you can pass them right after the image name. This works as long as you haven\'t specified any arguments in the Dockerfile\'s `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` that prevent this. 4. **Check the Output** After running the container, check the output to ensure that your application is working as expected within the Docker environment. 5. **Debugging** If you face any issues while running the container (e.g., application error, container immediately exits), you can check the logs of the container by running: ``` docker logs <container_name> ``` To interact with your application by getting a shell inside the container, you can use: ``` docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash <image_name> ``` Or if the container is already running, you can execute: ``` docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash ``` Once you confirm that the container is running and the `gtfsort` tool is working as expected, your Docker container is ready to be shared with others or deployed. Remember to substitute `<image_name>` with your chosen Docker image name, and `<container_name>` with a name for your running container instance."},{"instruction":"what does exactly happen when I run \\"docker build -t name .\\"","output":"When you run `docker build -t name .`, Docker performs the following steps to build a new Docker image based on the instructions specified in the Dockerfile located in the current directory (denoted by `.`): 1. **Context Gathering**: Docker starts by sending the entire current directory (the build context) to the Docker daemon. This includes all files and subdirectories; however, you can exclude files using a `.dockerignore` file. 2. **Image Tagging**: The `-t` option tags the resulting image with the name `name`. If you want to include a tag as well, you could format it as `name:tag`. 3. **Parsing Dockerfile**: The Docker daemon parses the Dockerfile line by line, starting with the first `FROM` instruction, which specifies the base image. 4. **Executing Instructions**: Each command in the Dockerfile translates to a new layer in the Docker image: - `FROM` initiates the build process and sets the base image. - `COPY` copies files and directories from the build context into the image filesystem. - `RUN` executes a command inside the image and commits the results. The `cargo build` in your example compiles the Rust project. - Additional Dockerfile commands not in your example (`CMD`, `EXPOSE`, `ENV`, etc.) set various image configurations. 5. **Intermediate Containers**: Each command in the Dockerfile creates an intermediate container which is started and modified according to the specific instruction. After the command runs successfully, the intermediate container is committed as a new image layer, and the container itself is removed. 6. **Layer Caching**: To speed up subsequent builds, Docker caches each layer. If a layer hasn\'t changed (same instruction and context), Docker uses the cached layer instead of running the instruction again. However, changes in one layer invalidate the cache for all subsequent layers. 7. **Final Image**: After all instructions have been executed, Docker produces the final image with the specified name and optional tag. Intermediate layers are still kept for caching purposes but are not part of the named image. 8. **Completion**: The `docker build` command finishes with a message indicating success and the final image ID. The new image can now be used to run containers using the `docker run` command. The Docker build process is efficient because it creates reusable layers and caches them. If you change your source code and re-run the `docker build` command, only the layers that have changed since the last build (typically just the application code layers) need to be rebuilt, which can save a lot of time."},{"instruction":"when I try to run it this happens: thread \'main\' panicked at src/main.rs:91:39: called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \\"No such file or directory\\" } note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace I run this: docker run gtfsort --input gtf_files/10k.gtf --output gtf_files/10k_sorted.gtf","output":"The error message you\'re seeing indicates that your Rust program panicked while unwrapping a `Result` type that turned out to be an `Err`. Specifically, the error is of kind `NotFound`, which usually means a file or directory couldn\'t be found. This is likely occurring because the file paths provided in the command line arguments are not accessible within the Docker container\'s filesystem. When you run a Docker container, it has its own isolated filesystem unless you explicitly share parts of the host filesystem with it. To fix this, you need to mount the directory containing your GTF files into the container using the `-v` (or `--volume`) option of `docker run`. Assuming the `gtf_files/` directory is in your current working directory on your host machine, and you want to use the same path inside the container, the docker run command should look like this: ```sh docker run --rm -v \\"(pwd)/gtf_files:/gtf_files\\" gtfsort --input /gtf_files/10k.gtf --output /gtf_files/10k_sorted.gtf ``` This command does the following: - `--rm`: Automatically remove the container when it exits, to avoid leaving behind stopped containers. - `-v \\"(pwd)/gtf_files:/gtf_files\\"`: Mount the `gtf_files/` directory from the current working directory into the Docker container at `/gtf_files`. The `(pwd)` command substitutes the current working directory of the host. - `gtfsort`: The name of the Docker image (replace it with the actual image name if it\'s different). - `--input /gtf_files/10k.gtf --output /gtf_files/10k_sorted.gtf`: The arguments for your program, modified to use the paths as they are mapped inside the Docker container. Be sure to adjust the paths accordingly if your directory structure is different. By using the `-v` option, your Docker container will be able to access the files it needs to process, and your program should run without the \\"file or directory not found\\" error."},{"instruction":"Сравни седеющим пунктам эти три текста между собой по следующим: 1.

Общий итог Текст 1: Пролог – Надо бы поворачивать, – встревожился Гаред, как только лес вокруг них начал темнеть. – Одичалые мертвы. – Неужели ты боишься покойников? – вопросил сир Уэймар Ройс с легким намеком на улыбку. Гаред не попался на крючок. За свои пятьдесят лет он успел навидаться, как приходят и уходят эти господа. – Мертвый мертв, – отвечал он. – С ним не о чем говорить. – А они действительно мертвы? – спросил Ройс. – Какие доказательства есть у нас? – Уилл видел их, – отвечал Гаред. – И если он говорит, что они мертвы, мне других доказательств не нужно. Уилл знал, что его рано или поздно вовлекут в разговор, и хотел, чтобы это случилось по возможности позже. – Мать моя говорила мне, что покойник не запоет, – сказал он. – То же самое говорила моя няня, – отозвался Ройс. – Уилл, никогда не верь тому, что слышишь возле женской титьки. Есть вещи, которые можно узнать даже от мертвых. – Голос его слишком громко отдавался в сумрачном лесу. – Нам предстоит долгая дорога, – напомнил Гаред. – Восемь дней, а быть может, и девять. И ночь уже близка. Сир Уэймар Ройс поглядел на небо без всякого интереса. – Ночь каждый день приходит примерно в это же время. Неужели тьма лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? Уилл увидел, как напрягся рот Гареда, как сверкнул едва сдерживаемый гнев в глазах под толстым черным капюшоном плаща. Сорок лет – юность и зрелость – провел Гаред в Ночном Дозоре, и свое прошлое он уважал. Однако здесь крылось нечто большее. Под раненой гордостью старшего Уилл угадывал нервное напряжение, опасно приближающееся к страху. Уилл разделял это нелегкое чувство. На Стене он провел четыре года. И когда в первый раз отправился за нее, то сразу вспомнил все старые россказни и чрево его обратилось в воду. Потом, вспоминая первую вылазку, он смеялся. Сотня походов сделала его ветераном, и бесконечная мрачная чаща, которую южане зовут Зачарованным лесом, более не казалась ему ужасной. Но не сегодня. Сегодняшний вечер сулил иное. В этой тьме таилось нечто, заставлявшее подниматься волосы на его затылке. Девять дней они ехали на север, потом на северо-запад и снова на север, все дальше от Стены, преследуя банду дикарей-налетчиков. Каждый день был хуже предшествовавшего ему. И нынешний стал наихудшим. С севера задувал холодный ветер, деревья шелестели, словно живые. Весь день Уиллу казалось, что за ним следит нечто холодное и непреклонное, совершенно не испытывающее к нему симпатии. Гаред ощущал то же самое. Уилл хотел одного – броситься во всю конскую прыть под защиту Стены, но подобными чувствами не делятся со своим командиром. В особенности с таким командиром. Сир Уэймар Ройс был самым молодым отпрыском древнего рода, одним из многочисленных наследников. Симпатичный юноша лет восемнадцати, сероглазый, изящный и стройный, как клинок. Восседая на спине своего рослого вороного боевого коня, рыцарь возвышался над Уиллом и Гаредом на их невысоких дорожных лошадках. Все на нем: черные кожаные сапоги, черные шерстяные штаны, черные перчатки из кротовых шкурок и тонко выделанная куртка из блестящих черных кольчужных колец, нашитых на стеганые слои черной шерсти и вареной кожи, – говорило о принадлежности к Ночному Дозору. Сир Уэймар присягнул на верность братству менее полугода назад, и никто не мог сказать, что он не был подготовлен для такого занятия. Во всяком случае, если говорить о его гардеробе. Довершал одеяние плащ. Соболиный, толстый, черный и соблазнительно мягкий. – Клянется, что сам убил всех зверьков, вот так вот, – показывал Гаред в казарме за вином. – Свернул им головенки наш могучий воитель. Все дружно хохотали. Трудно повиноваться человеку, которого осмеиваешь за выпивкой, думал Уилл, ежившийся на спине своей лошаденки. Гаред, должно быть, испытывал те же чувства. – Мормонт приказал нам выследить их, и мы это сделали, – проговорил Гаред. – Одичалые мертвы. Более они не причинят хлопот. А нам предстоит тяжелая дорога. Мне не нравится погода. Если пойдет снег, на возвращение домой уйдет две недели, а ведь даже снегопад будет подарком. Вы когда-нибудь видели ледяную бурю, милорд? Лорденыш как будто и не слышал его. Ройс изучал сгущающийся сумрак в этакой полурассеянности-полускуке. Уилл успел достаточно долго проездить с рыцарем и знал – лучше не докучать ему в подобном настроении. – Опиши мне еще раз то, что ты видел, Уилл. Все подробности. Ничего не забудь. Прежде чем поступить в Ночной Дозор, Уилл был охотником, точнее говоря, браконьером. Вольные всадники Маллистеров взяли его с кровью на руках в собственных лесах Маллистеров, над освежеванной тушей одного из оленей, принадлежавших Маллистерам; так что ему осталось или надеть черное, или расстаться с рукой. Никто не умел двигаться по лесу безмолвнее Уилла, и Черные Братья весьма скоро обнаружили этот дар. – Их лагерь располагается в двух милях отсюда, за тем гребнем, возле ручья, – проговорил Уилл. – Я подобрался так близко, как только осмелился. Одичалых – восьмеро, есть и мужчины, и женщины. Я не видел там никаких детей. Они соорудили навес возле скалы. Теперь все засыпал снег, но я не заметил огня, хотя кострище было видно как на ладони. Никто не двигался, а ведь я долго следил за ними. Живому человеку не под силу пролежать так, не шевелясь. – А ты видел кровь? – Нет, – признал Уилл. – А оружие? – Несколько мечей и луков. У одного был топор, тяжелый такой, с двумя лезвиями… жестокое железо. Он лежал на земле возле этого человека, прямо у руки. – А ты заметил положение тел? Уилл пожал плечами: – Один сидел возле скалы. Остальные были на земле, попопадали, что ли. – Или спали, – предположил Ройс. – Упали, – настаивал Уилл. – Женщина влезла наверх железного дерева и пряталась среди ветвей. Дозорная. – Он тонко улыбнулся. – Я старался, чтобы она не увидела меня. Но когда подобрался ближе, то заметил, что и она не шевелится. – И против желания он поежился. – Тебе холодно? – спросил Ройс. – Слегка, – пробормотал Уилл. – Ветер, милорд. Молодой рыцарь повернулся к седому оруженосцу. Побитые морозом листья с шелестом пролетели мимо, и конь Ройса беспокойно шевельнулся. – Итак, какова, по-твоему, была причина смерти этих людей, Гаред? – непринужденно спросил сир Уэймар, поправляя длинный соболиный плащ. – Холод, – отвечал Гаред с железной уверенностью. – Прошлой зимой я видел, как замерзают люди, видел и позапрошлой, когда был еще наполовину мальчишкой. Все говорят о снегах глубиной в сорок футов, о том, как ледяной ветер, воя, налетает с севера, но главным врагом является холод. Он добирается до тебя бесшумнее, чем Уилл, и сперва ты только поеживаешься и стучишь зубами, а потом топаешь ногами и мечтаешь о подогретом вине с пряностями и чудесном жарком очаге. Мороз жжет. Ничто не обжигает, как холод. Но лишь поначалу. А потом он проникает внутрь тела, наполняет тебя, пока у человека не остается сил сопротивляться. Легче просто сесть и уснуть. Говорят, что, замерзая, перед концом не чувствуешь никакой боли. Просто слабеешь и тихонько засыпаешь, все словно блекнет, а потом как будто проваливаешься в море теплого молока, в мир и покой. – Экое красноречие, Гаред, – усмехнулся сир Уэймар. – Никогда не подозревал в тебе подобного дара. – Холод проникал и в меня, молодой лорд. – Гаред откинул назад капюшон, давая сиру Уэймару возможность рассмотреть обрубки, оставшиеся на месте ушей. – Два уха, три пальца на ногах и мизинец на левой руке. Я еще легко отделался. Моего брата тогда нашли замерзшим и улыбающимся. Сир Уэймар пожал плечами: – Надо было одеться потеплее, Гаред. Тот гневно глянул на юного лорда, шрамы на месте ушей, там, где мейстер Эйемон срезал обмороженный хрящ, налились кровью от гнева. – Посмотрим, как согреет тебя одежда, когда придет зима. – Он натянул на голову капюшон и сгорбился на своей лошади, угрюмый и молчаливый. – Если Гаред говорит, что было холодно… – начал Уилл. – А ты был в карауле на прошлой неделе, Уилл? – Да, милорд. – Ни одна неделя не проходила без того, чтобы ему не выпадало с дюжину этих паскудных караулов. Чего, собственно, Ройс хочет от него? – И какой была Стена? – Мокрой, – сказал Уилл хмурясь. Теперь он понял, чего добивается молодой лорд. – Они не могли замерзнуть. Ведь Стена подтаяла. Настоящего холода не было. Ройс кивнул: – Смышленый парень. На этой неделе несколько раз подмораживало, выпадал снег, но холодов, достаточно свирепых, чтобы убить восьмерых взрослых людей, не было. Напоминаю: одетых в меха и кожу, возле укрытия и костра. – Улыбка рыцаря сделалась самоуверенной. – Уилл, веди нас туда, я сам хочу увидеть этих мертвецов. Ну что ж, делать нечего. Приказ отдан, надо повиноваться. Уилл направился первым, его косматая невысокая лошадка внимательно выбирала путь через подлесок. Позапрошлой ночью выпал легкий снежок, и камни, корни и ямки прятались под его поверхностью, поджидая неосторожного и беспечного. Сир Уэймар Ройс следовал за ним, рослый вороной жеребец нетерпеливо фыркал. Боевой конь не годился для разведки, но попробуй это сказать его лордству. Гаред замыкал линию. Старый оруженосец что-то бурчал под нос. Сумерки сгущались. Неласковое небо сперва приняло глубокий пурпурный оттенок, потом цвет старого синяка и, наконец, почернело. Начали выступать звезды. Над деревьями объявился и полумесяц. Уилл обрадовался свету. – Можно бы и прибавить шагу, – заметил Ройс, когда луна поднялась повыше. – Я не уверен, – отвечал Уилл. Страх заставил его забыть про вежливость. – Быть может, милорд хочет возглавить нас? Сир Уэймар Ройс не потрудился ответить. Где-то вдалеке в лесу завыл волк. Уилл завел свою лошадь под ствол, древний и корявый, и спешился. – Почему ты остановился? – спросил сир Уэймар. – Остаток пути лучше пройти пешком, милорд. Место как раз за гребнем. Вглядываясь вдаль, Ройс помедлил, на мгновение остановившись в явной задумчивости. Холодный ветер прошелестел в деревьях, толстый меховой плащ рыцаря словно бы сам собой шевельнулся сзади. – Здесь что-то неладно, – пробормотал Гаред. Молодой рыцарь посмотрел на него с презрительной улыбкой: – В самом деле? – Неужели вы не ощущаете сами? – спросил Гаред. – Прислушайтесь к тьме. Уилл чувствовал это. За все четыре года, проведенных в Ночном Дозоре, ему никогда не приводилось так пугаться. Что это такое? – Дует ветер. Деревья шелестят. Волк воет. Какой звук лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? – Не дождавшись ответа, Ройс изящно выскользнул из седла. Он надежно привязал скакуна к низкому суку, чуть в стороне от остальных, и извлек из ножен длинный меч. На рукоятке блеснули самоцветы, лунный свет пробежал по сверкающей стали. Великолепное оружие, выкованное в замке, и не столь уж давно, если как следует приглядеться. Только вот едва ли им замахивались в гневе, решил Уилл. – Здесь всюду деревья, – предостерег Уилл. – Меч помешает вам, милорд. Лучше возьмите нож. – Если мне потребуются наставления, я попрошу их, – сказал молодой лорд. – Гаред, оставайся здесь. Охраняй коней. Гаред спешился. – Нам нужен огонь. Я разведу костер. – Какой же ты дурак, старик! Если по этому лесу бродят враги, значит, в огне мы нуждаемся в самую последнюю очередь. – Бывает, что врагов огонь удерживает в стороне, – проговорил Гаред. – Его боятся медведи и лютоволки… да и другие… Рот сира Уэймара сложился в прямую линию: – Никакого огня! Капюшон Гареда прикрыл лицо, но, поворачиваясь к рыцарю, Уилл заметил в глазах старика жесткий блеск. На миг он испугался, что Гаред достанет свой меч… короткая уродливая штуковина, рукоятка изъедена по́том, лезвие притуплено долгим употреблением… Уилл не дал бы железного шиллинга за жизнь лорденыша, если бы Гаред извлек свой клинок из ножен. Наконец Гаред поглядел вниз. – Никакого огня, – пробормотал он едва слышным голосом. Ройс принял это за подтверждение и отвернулся. – Ступай, – сказал он Уиллу. Уилл направился в чащу, потом вверх по склону к высокому гребню, где он обнаружил удобное место под страж-деревом. Тонкая корочка снега едва прикрывала грязь и влагу, ноги скользили – мешали камни и скрытые корни, – однако, поднимаясь, Уилл не произвел ни звука. За его спиной негромко позвякивал кольчугой лорденок, шелестели листья, раздавались негромкие ругательства, когда загребущие ветви цеплялись за длинный меч и за великолепный соболий плащ. Огромное страж-дерево находилось прямо на гребне; как помнил Уилл, нижние ветви его поднимались от земли почти на фут. Уилл скользнул под дерево, лег на живот в снег и грязь, поглядел на пустую поляну внизу, и сердце его провалилось в пятки. Мгновение он не смел дохнуть. Луна освещала поляну, кострище, занесенный снегом навес, огромную скалу, маленький узкий полузамерзший ручеек. Все это осталось неизменным – как и несколько часов назад. Но людей не было, все тела исчезли. – Ах, боги! – услышал он позади себя голос. Меч рубанул по ветке, и сир Уэймар Ройс поднялся на гребень. Он остановился возле страж-дерева с мечом в руках, ветер раздувал плащ, все вокруг могли видеть благородный силуэт на фоне звездного неба. – Немедленно вниз! – настоятельно шепнул Уилл. – Здесь что-то не так. Ройс не шевельнулся. Он поглядел на пустую прогалину и расхохотался: – Выходит, твои мертвецы куда-то перебрались. Голос Уилла предал его. Он искал слова и не находил их. Немыслимо! Глаза его метались взад и вперед по покинутому стану и остановились на топоре. Огромный боевой топор с двумя лезвиями все еще лежал на прежнем месте. Ценное оружие… – На ноги, Уилл, – приказал сир Уэймар. – Здесь никого нет. Я не хочу, чтобы ты прятался под кустом. Уилл нерешительно поднял голову. Сир Уэймар глядел на него с открытым неодобрением. – Я не намереваюсь вернуться в Черный замок с признанием о неудаче моей первой вылазки. Мы найдем этих людей. – Он огляделся. – Лезь на дерево. И быстро. Ищи огонь. Уилл молча отвернулся, спорить было бесполезно. Ветер менялся. Теперь порывы продували насквозь. Уилл подошел к дереву, высоко поднимавшему свои серо-зеленые ветви, и полез вверх. Скоро руки его запачкались смолой, и он почти потерялся среди иголок. Страх наполнил нутро Уилла комом непереваренной пищи. Прочитав молитву безымянным богам леса, он извлек свой кинжал из ножен и зажал в зубах, чтобы можно было держаться за дерево обеими руками. Вкус холодного железа во рту почему-то всегда успокаивал его. Лорденыш внизу вдруг воскликнул: – Кто идет? Уилл услышал неуверенность в его голосе и замер, прислушиваясь и наблюдая. Лес дал ответ: шелестели листья, в ледяном ложе бежал ручей, вдалеке кричала снежная сова. Иные не издают звуков. Уилл заметил движение уголком глаза. Бледные силуэты появились в лесу. Повернув голову, он увидел белую тень, скользнувшую во тьме. Тень исчезла. Ветки легко шевелились под ветром, скребли друг друга деревянными пальцами. Уилл открыл рот, чтобы выкрикнуть предупреждение, но слова как будто замерзли в его горле. Возможно, он ошибся, и это всего лишь птица или отражение, брошенное на снег прихотью лунного света. В конце концов, что он видел? – Уилл, где ты? – поднял голову вверх сир Уэймар. – Ты заметил что-нибудь? – Зажав в руке меч, рыцарь медленно, с внезапным напряжением повернулся на месте. Значит, и он ощутил их. Ощутил, но не увидел. – Отвечай мне! Почему так холодно? Было действительно холодно. Ежась, Уилл плотнее прижался к стволу, припав лицом к грубой коре. Сладко пахло смолой, прилипшей к щеке. Из тьмы леса родилась тень и остановилась перед Ройсом. Высокая, тощая и твердая, как старые кости, и вместе с тем бледная, как молоко. Панцирь ее словно менял цвет при каждом движении. Он то становился белым, как свежевыпавший снег, то покрывался угольной тенью, то отливал серой зеленью деревьев. С каждым шагом новый узор пробегал по броне, словно лунный свет по воде. Уилл услышал, как дыхание с долгим шипением вырвалось из груди сира Уэймара Ройса. – Стой! – выкрикнул лорденыш, дав петуха как мальчишка. Забросив длинный соболий плащ за плечи, он освободил обе руки для боя и взял меч. Ветер утих, но сделалось еще холоднее. Иной скользил вперед, бесшумно ступая; в руке существо держало длинный меч. Таких клинков Уилл никогда не видел. Ни один известный людям металл не мог бы пойти на это лезвие. Играя в лунном свете, меч казался прозрачной полоской тонкого хрусталя и почти исчезал, поворачиваясь плоскостью. Он горел призрачным голубым пламенем, и чутье поведало Уиллу, что более острого клинка ему еще не встречалось. – Ну что ж, попляшем и согреемся, – пробормотал сир Уэймар и занес свой меч над головой. Руки его дрожали от тяжести оружия или, может быть, от холода. И все же в тот момент Уилл увидел в нем не прежнего мальчика, но мужа из Ночного Дозора. Иной остановился, и Уилл заметил глаза существа: глубокая и густая нечеловеческая синева сверкала как лед. Они были обращены к длинному мечу, занесенному над головой, и лунный свет леденил металл. На миг Уилл потерял надежду. Они безмолвно возникали из теней двойниками первого. Их было трое… четверо… пятеро… Сир Уэймар, должно быть, ощущал холод, который принесли Иные, но не видел их, даже не слышал. Уиллу следовало бы крикнуть. Но, выполняя свой долг, он лишь навлек бы на себя несомненную смерть. Трепеща, Уилл только теснее обнял дерево, сохраняя молчание. Бледный меч холодом пронзил воздух. Сир Уэймар встретил удар сталью. Клинки соприкоснулись не со звоном металла о металл: в воздухе проплыл тонкий стон животного, получившего смертельную рану. Ройс отразил и второй удар, и третий, а затем отступил на шаг. Последовал еще поток ударов, и он снова отступил. Позади него, справа, слева, вокруг стояли терпеливые, безликие и безмолвные наблюдатели, текучие узоры на хрупкой броне делали их в лесу почти невидимыми. И все же они не пытались вмешаться. Вновь и вновь встречались мечи. Уиллу захотелось зажать уши, только бы не слышать этот странный болезненный визг. Сир Уэймар теперь пыхтел от натуги, дыхание паром струилось в лунном свете. Его клинок побелел от мороза. Иной же плясал вокруг с бледным голубым пламенем в руках. А потом удар Ройса чуть запоздал. Бледный меч прорезал его кольчугу на боку. Молодой лорд вскрикнул от боли. Кровь хлынула между колец. Она задымилась на холоде, красные как огонь капли падали на снег. Пальцы сира Уэймара зажали бок, на кротовой перчатке выступила кровь. Иной что-то сказал: языка Уилл не знал, голос чужака трещал словно лед на зимнем озере, но в словах слышалась насмешка. К сиру Уэймару вновь вернулась ярость. – За короля Роберта! – закричал он и отчаянно бросился вперед, обеими руками занес покрытый изморозью меч и рубанул им сбоку, вложив в удар вес всего тела. Иной ответил небрежным ленивым движением. Клинки соприкоснулись, и сталь разбилась. С визгом, отозвавшимся в ночном лесу, длинный меч рассыпался на сотню хрупких иголок, дождем разлетевшихся вокруг. Ройс упал на колени, с криком прижимая руку к глазам. Кровь проступала между его пальцев. Безмолвные наблюдатели разом шагнули вперед, словно получив какой-то сигнал. Мечи поднимались и падали в смертельном безмолвии. Началась хладнокровная бойня. Бледные клинки прорезали кольчугу, словно какой-то шелк. Уилл закрыл глаза. Голоса их и смех, колючий словно сосульки, раздавались где-то под ним. Не скоро он накопил достаточно отваги, чтобы поглядеть вниз, даже когда гребень уже опустел. Едва смея дышать, Уилл еще долго оставался на дереве, и луна медленно ползла по черному небу. Наконец мышцы его окоченели, пальцы онемели от холода, и он стал спускаться. Тело Ройса лежало лицом в снег, одна рука была протянута в сторону, толстый соболий плащ прорезан в дюжине мест. Было видно, насколько он молод. Мальчишка. Уилл нашел остатки меча чуть в стороне: клинок расщепился и изогнулся, напоминая дерево, пораженное ударом молнии. Став на колени, Уилл осторожно огляделся вокруг и подобрал оружие. Расщепленный клинок послужит доказательством его слов. Гаред знает, что все это значит, а если нет, то поймет старый медведь Мормонт или мейстер Эйемон. Ждет ли его еще Гаред с лошадьми? Надо торопиться. Уилл поднялся. Над ним высился сир Уэймар Ройс. Тонкие одежды разодраны, лицо разбито. Осколок торчал из ослепленной левой глазницы. Правый глаз был открыт. Зрачок его горел синим огнем и… видел. Сломанный меч упал из бесчувственных пальцев. Уилл закрыл глаза, чтобы помолиться. Длинные благородные пальцы коснулись его щеки, стиснули горло. Уилл ощутил прикосновение тончайшей выделки кротовой кожи, липкой от крови. Но прикосновение оказалось ледяным. Текст 2: Пролог В городе, который некогда назывался Кабитэла, а ныне — Оллария, цвела сирень. Ее белые и лиловые свечи, как и положено горящим свечам, были обречены. Обречены были и воркующие на крышах голуби, и суетящиеся на улицах люди, и сам этот мир, но неизбежность конца придавала весеннему городу некое горькое очарование. Трудно любить то, что всегда было и всегда будет, зато осознание того, что «это в последний раз», оживляет притупившиеся чувства, и ты замечаешь вещи, которые раньше не замечал, и сердце твое разрывается от любви и боли. Одинокий в последний раз шел улицами Олларии — этот мир становился опасен. Скоро старая, добрая Кэртиана будет вотчиной раттонов, пройдет еще несколько веков, и то, во что превратится некогда вольный и радостный мир, придется уничтожить. Из великого Ожерелья выпадет еще одна бусина — не столь уж и страшная потеря, ведь сама Нить уцелеет. Шедший цветущим городом гость понимал, что беда случится не завтра. То, что для него было «скоро», для смертных означало почти «никогда». Люди, спешащие по своим делам и странным образом не замечающие высокого чужака, успеют долюбить, досуетиться, доненавидеть, равно, как и их дети, внуки и правнуки. И все равно Одинокому было мучительно жаль исполненный жизни город с его каштанами и сиренью, щебечущими скворцами, красными черепичными крышами и булыжными мостовыми. Люди… Одинокий усмехнулся — он ведь тоже БЫЛ человеком. Был, пока не прошел Костры Этерны. Его никто не вынуждал — в пламя Этерны нельзя ни столкнуть, ни заманить. Он сам выбрал свою судьбу, согласившись умереть, чтоб воскреснуть Стражем Заката, вечным воином и странником, давшим клятву хранить Ожерелье. Одинокий не знал, как и где начался его путь, — Нить длинна, а его память сгорела в вихре лилового огня, огня цвета увядающей сирени. Нет, он ни в чем не раскаивался и ни о чем не жалел, — бесконечный бой, в котором не может быть победы, стал его прошлым, настоящим и будущим, не оставив места для сомнений и тоски, но в некоторых мирах страннику хотелось задержаться. Одинокий полагал, что эти миры чем-то напоминали его прежнюю родину, но чем — не знал и не мог знать. Все, что случилось до того, как будущий Страж Заката шагнул в лиловый костер и адская боль разорвала в клочья сознание, исчезло. Это было разумно — прошлое имеет над нами слишком большую власть. Те, кто держит на плечах небо, должны быть свободны от былых привязанностей и долгов, но весенняя Кэртиана пьянила и печалила. Может, все дело было в цветущих каштанах и сирени, а может, в чужих улыбках или в стремительных острокрылых ласточках… Одинокий протянул руку, и могучий каштан медленно склонил ветви навстречу чужаку. Сильные пальцы легко коснулись цветочной грозди, и путник чему-то улыбнулся, по-кошачьи сощурившись. Он мог обернуться стариком, юношей, женщиной, леопардом, драконом, наконец, но предпочитал оставаться самим собой. Внешность — единственное, что оставил ему лиловый огонь. Страж Заката надеялся, что кто-то когда-то любил его именно таким. Или ненавидел. Одинокий не сомневался, что всегда был воином, но все остальное… Было ли ему что терять? Хотелось верить, что было. Иногда он пытался придумать себе человеческое прошлое, счастье, от которого отказался, последовав за позвавшей его адой, но выдумки или таяли, как облака, или жгли, как раскаленное железо. Вечный воин, он сочинял сказки о великой любви и преданной дружбе, а они не сочинялись. Он видел себя умирающим от удара в спину, ожидающим пыток и казни, скитающимся в чужих краях, идущим сквозь чужую зависть, злобу, презрение, но не счастливым. Отчего-то казалось, что в его жизни ненависти было больше, чем любви, а боли больше, чем радости, и все равно Одинокий предпочел бы помнить все. Колокольный перезвон вернул странника на землю Кэртианы. Смертные всегда и всюду просят небожителей о милости, не зная, что боги погибли, а те, кто принял их ношу, не имеют ни сил, ни возможности снисходить к человеческим просьбам. Чуждое не оставляет попыток поглотить Ожерелье, а противостоят растущему напору лишь Одинокие. Их дело — сражаться, и, пока они бьются, смертным отвечают раттоны, будь они трижды прокляты! Одинокий отпустил ветку и двинулся дальше, смешавшись с изливающимся из храма людским потоком. Его не замечали, не «не видели», а именно не замечали, зато он замечал все, — ведь он видел Кэртиану в последний раз, Кэртиану, которая тысячи лет была его «поляной в лесу», местом, к которому тянулось его сердце. Залечив раны и набравшись сил, он прежде, чем вернуться в бой, проходил через этот мир, запоминая женский смех и детские крики. Одинокий не создавал Кэртиану и не был ею создан, но ему хотелось любить, и он полюбил этот мир и, защищая Ожерелье, защищал в первую очередь его. Кэртиана жила и дышала за его спиной, так было, но так больше не будет. Он не вправе позволить раттонам отыскать свои следы — Осень слишком драгоценна, чтобы рисковать ею. Осень дороже Кэртианы, а Ожерелье дороже одной из бусин. Когда Этерна была цела, они сражались за каждый из миров Ожерелья. Теперешних сил едва хватает, чтобы сдерживать Чуждое на Новом Рубеже. Раньше Одинокие вмешивались в дела смертных, называвших их кто богами, кто демонами, теперь в прошлом и это. В прошлом все, кроме боя. Когда падет последний защитник, придет конец и Ожерелью, только раттонам этого не понять. Они вообще мало что понимают, эти возомнившие себя богами ничтожества. Играя в свои игры, они подгрызают Нить, невольно помогая тому или тем, кто рвется к ней снаружи. Теперь они подняли голову и в Кэртиане. Одинокий медленно шел по залитым солнцем улицам, наслаждаясь тем, что ступает по твердой земле, дышит полной грудью, видит цветы и улыбки. Грязь, старость, несправедливость никуда не исчезли, но он старался не думать о них, так же как и о раттонах. Твари еще не вошли в полную силу, Кэртиана не знает, что смертельно больна, и в этом ее счастье. Если б он мог задержаться! Но каждый должен делать то, что за него не сделает никто. Место Одинокого — его бой на Рубеже. Внутренние Миры выживают или погибают сами и по своей вине. Смертные наделены волей и разумом, они могут и должны дать отпор раттонам, а не идти у них на поводу, но как им это объяснишь?! Он несколько раз пробовал говорить с людьми — его не понимали. Улица заканчивалась у старинной стены, к которой лепились торговые ряды. Оллария поглотила старую Кабитэлу. Новое или поглощает старое, или убивает. Когда-то здесь расстилались ржаные поля, которые топтали воины Франциска Оллара, бастарда, пожелавшего стать великим королем и ставшего им. Губы Одинокого скривились в усмешке. Откуда у него привычка улыбаться и даже смеяться, когда на сердце особенно мерзко, Страж Заката не знал. Возможно, это тень его старой жизни. Магия Этерны была сильна, но даже она не уничтожила всего. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но его притягивали или, наоборот, отталкивали некоторые звуки, запахи, лица. Вот и тот рыцарь, которому он сказал, что совесть выше и чести, и закона, почему он заговорил именно с ним? Сколько лет прошло! Почему ему до сих пор больно вспоминать, чем все закончилось? Кэртианца давным-давно нет на свете, а Одинокий все ищет для него слова и доводы, ищет и не находит. И все равно случившееся тогда отобрало у раттонов несколько веков. Для Ожерелья — миг, для Кэртианы — жизнь восьми или десяти поколений. Жаль только, что тот, кто подарил своему миру четыреста лет свободы, не дождался ни благодарности, ни понимания… Толпившиеся на улице горожане расступились, пропуская красивого всадника на породистой вороной кобыле, и Одинокий невольно залюбовался. Человек был счастлив, как может быть счастлив лишь… человек, живущий единым, сверкающим мигом. Он любил и был любим — Одинокий понял это сразу. Захваченный волной чужой радости, странник не сразу почуял приглушенную ненависть. За влюбленным следили. Кто? Соперник? Муж? Или эта злоба не имеет ничего общего с чужим счастьем? Похоже на то, уж больно она холодна и расчетлива. Страж Заката пожал плечами, мысленно пожелав неведомому всаднику избежать удара в спину, и сразу же забыл и о нем, и о его враге. Этот вечер принадлежал ему, и он хотел провести его так, словно сам был плотью от плоти этого мира. Ожерелье, Рубеж, бой без надежды и без конца — все это нет, не исчезло, но словно бы отодвинулось. Одинокий чувствовал себя свободным и смертным, он даже позволил себе зайти в таверну и сесть в углу, куда немедленно принесли кувшин с вином, после чего никто и не подумал взглянуть в сторону странного посетителя. Люди приходили и уходили, а Одинокий смотрел на них — пьющих, смеющихся, поющих… Откуда-то вылезла маленькая пятнистая кошка, почти котенок, и остановилась, нерешительно глядя на гостя. Кошка — не человек, ей глаза не отведешь. Эти маленькие вольные твари не только чуют всех, владеющих магией, но и сами ей сопричастны, потому-то раттоны их и ненавидят. И ненависть эта взаимна. Если кошек начинают гнать, проклинать, называть нечистыми, предавшимися злу тварями, ищи поблизости раттонов. Одинокий поднял бровь, и кошка, расценив это как приглашение, прыгнула ему на колени. В зверьке билась магическая искра, маленькая и слабая, но отчетливая. Кошки понимают, что ждет Кэртиану. Кошки, но не люди. Воин успел застать создателей этого мира. Их было четверо, и они откликнулись на призыв Этерны и ушли на Рубеж, поручив Кэртиану своим избранникам из числа смертных. Человеческой памяти хватило на три тысячи лет. Не так уж и мало, если вспомнить, что люди редко живут дольше семидесяти… Правнукам нынешних гуляк придется туго — раттоны убивают чужую радость, может быть, потому, что сами на нее не способны. Зависть, злоба, страх — это да, это по ним, но радости этим существам не отпущено. Только злорадство. Возможно, их стоит пожалеть, но Одинокий, если б мог, перебил их всех. Если б мог… Здешним обитателям и не снилась мощь, которой он обладал. Страж Заката мог уничтожить Кэртиану и боялся, что испить эту чашу доведется именно ему. В его власти уничтожить, но не спасти. Как легко сжечь зачумленный город и этим остановить заразу, но кто возьмется одолеть беду, выловив всех чумных крыс? А раттоны — чумные крысы Ожерелья, их становится все больше, а Одиноких все меньше! Кошка, почуяв его ярость, вздрогнула и прижала уши. Она знала, как сражаться с крысами, если б ее сородичи были покрупнее и посильнее, если б их удалось объединить и натравить на этих, с позволения сказать, новых владык, но увы! Страж Заката взял кубок и поднес к кошачьей морде. Зверушка брезгливо сморщила нос и отодвинулась. Пробовать вино она не собиралась, и Одинокий выпил сам. В память первых богов Кэртианы! Они были готовы умереть на Рубеже, а смерть настигла их в Этерне, казавшейся самым безопасным местом Ожерелья. Тогда погибли многие и вместе с ними погибла надежда. Одинокий залпом допил вино, словно ему, теперешнему, это могло помочь. Вечер продолжался. Играла музыка, танцевала черноволосая девушка в алой, низко вырезанной блузке, а он видел шар ревущего пламени, чудовищную звезду, родившуюся из гибели Этерны. Нет, это было потом, конь его судьбы свернул с общей дороги раньше. …Они стояли под серебристым мертвым небом без солнца и птиц, а Пепельное море лениво переливало у их ног тяжелые, медленные волны. Казалось, Чуждое устало рваться вперед, его напор ослабел. Уходившие в Этерну шутили, что отдыхать можно и на Рубеже, и они готовы остаться. Потом камни на мечах вспыхнули лиловыми звездами, предупреждая о том, что Чуждое шевельнулось. Приближался бой — один из множества, — ничего выдающегося, сколько таких было, и сколько еще будет. Горизонт набухал похожими на гарадских итаров тучами, предвещая бурю, которую предстояло остановить. Шторм надвигался медленно и неотвратимо, нападавшие и обороняющие в тысячный раз готовились помериться силами, заранее зная, что они равны. Стратег остающихся нехорошо улыбнулся, приветствуя подползавшего врага, небо стало ниже, море с шумом отступало, обнажая скалистое дно. Ни водорослей, ни раковин, ни бьющейся на мели рыбы. Только серый, отливающий сталью камень… — Нам пора, — Одинокий забыл, кто произнес эти слова, — это не наш бой. Бой и вправду был не их. Они сделали свое дело и могли возвращаться в Этерну, но он избрал другую дорогу. Дворец Архонта с его вечными празднествами в честь вернувшихся с Рубежа и уходящих на Рубеж был хорош, но Одинокий не любил пиров, можно даже сказать, ненавидел. Видимо, это тоже выползло из его убитого прошлого. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но каждая поднятая в высоких чертогах чаша отзывалась в сердце звериной тоской. Одинокий любил своих товарищей, любовался адами, верил Архонту и Стратегам, но их буйное веселье было не по нему. Похоже, он стал Одиноким до того, как это слово сорвалось с губ последней уцелевшей ады. Как бы то ни было, ненависть к пирам его и спасла. Убегая от ненавистной радости, он забрел сюда, в Кэртиану, где его и застиг зов. Рубеж просил помощи, и было некогда думать, что там происходит. Он бросился назад… Одинокий с силой сжал пустой кубок, вспоминая непосильную тяжесть, словно ему, как герою легенды, и впрямь пришлось взвалить на плечи небесный свод. Рядом кто-то упал, груз стал еще неподъемней, он стиснул зубы, заставляя себя держаться. Сгоревшие Миры, по которым пролегал Рубеж, были мертвы, их можно было оставить без особого риска, но, единожды отступив, отступишь снова, и он держался, они все держались… Чуждое наконец схлынуло, как всегда, рассыпавшись стаей странных, смертных созданий, на сей раз похожих на летучих медуз. Полупрозрачная мерзость сама бросалась на мечи, словно желая побыстрее со всем покончить. Одинокому показалось, что бой длился дольше, чем обычно, но, возможно, он просто устал. — В Этерне решили, что мы испугались собственной тени? — недовольно бросил бившийся рядом Стратег, разрубая слизистый гриб. — Я не был там. — Одинокий отшвырнул студенистое полушарие. — Не понимаю. Нас не услышали? Или что-то стряслось в самой Этерне? Тогда это показалось бредом. Что могло стрястись в месте, исполненном великой Силы, покорной Архонту и его сподвижникам? Нет, это невиданная доселе схватка приглушила Зов, и он не достиг цели. — Как бы то ни было, я должен говорить с Архонтом, — бросил Стратег, оглядывая из-под руки серебристый горизонт, — и я буду говорить с ним. Поговорить с Архонтом Стратегу не удалось — Этерны больше не существовало. Что именно произошло, уцелевшие так никогда и не узнали. Был ли это заговор, неосторожность, несчастливая случайность или же сработал доселе неведомый закон мироздания, но произошло то, что произошло. Те, кого в час беды не оказалось в Этерне, собрались на Рубеже. Их было больше, чем они боялись, и меньше, чем надеялись. Выжившие могли держать Рубеж, но не создавать миры и не одаривать избранных бессмертием и силой. Одинокий навеки запомнил глаза Стратега — исполненные боли и тревоги глаза воина, осознавшего, что ему не дождаться ни помощи, ни приказа, что все смотрят на него и отныне от него зависит исход войны… Стратег стал Архонтом, а все они — Одинокими, не загадывавшими дальше грядущей схватки. Рано или поздно Чуждое прорвет оборону и набросится на внутренние миры, впрочем, в последнее время Одинокий стал опасаться, что раттоны погубят Ожерелье прежде, чем падет Рубеж. …Крик был неожиданным и страшным. Это не было зовом в прямом смысле этого слова, но Одинокий вскочил, сбросив на пол раздосадованную кошку. Неподалеку шел неравный бой — кто-то в одиночку отбивался от множества убийц. Страж Заката чувствовал их ярость, удивление и, наконец, страх. Тот, на кого напали, был обречен, но он дрался и как дрался! Одинокий словно бы вживую увидел большую, тускло освещенную комнату, опрокинутую, разбитую мебель, мечущиеся силуэты, чьи-то глаза, белые от ярости… Странно, он ведь отгородился от чужих мыслей и чувств, и отгородился надежно, в чем же дело? Раттоны? Нет, тут они ни при чем. Страж Заката, по-прежнему никем не примеченный, выбежал на улицу. Город спал или делал вид, что спит, было тихо, но Одинокий не сомневался — рядом убивают. Более того, он знал, кого именно — всадника, встреченного им на площади. Те, кто за ним следил, времени зря не теряли. Где-то завыла собака, хлопнула дверь, в окне напротив задули свечу. Воин пожал плечами и быстро пошел по пустынному переулку. Зачем ему это? Люди вечно враждуют, а если не могут справиться с противником в открытом бою, бьют в спину. Кэртиана не исключение, скоро здесь и вовсе начнется война всех со всеми. Война, в которой не будет победителей, кроме раттонов. Переулок влился в тихую улицу, застроенную двухэтажными домами; в одном из них погибал человек, чья неистовая радость разбудила в Одиноком то, что, казалось, ушло навсегда. Между ним и смертным возникла ниточка, которая и привела чужака к изящному особняку, в котором шел бой. Шел, хотя должен был уже закончиться. Жалобно зазвенело разбитое окно, сквозь которое пролетел какой-то обломок, раздался крик, и ответом ему был наглухо захлопнувшийся ставень в доме напротив. Эта «хата» явно была «с краю». Снова звон, злобный вопль, глухие удары и возня внутри и мертвая тишина снаружи. Как похоже на людей… Остатки здравого смысла шептали, уговаривали, требовали оставить все, как есть. Одинокие не вмешиваются в дела смертных, Кэртиана захвачена раттонами, он не должен оставлять следов… Он их и не оставит! Зачем тратить Силу, ведь он может драться, как человек! Он это умеет, всегда умел, и будь трижды прокляты все раттоны всех миров и все запреты! Одинокий выхватил меч и пинком вышиб жалобно вскрикнувшую дверь. Текст 3: Пролог «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой...","output":"1.

Общий итог Текст 1: Пролог – Надо бы поворачивать, – встревожился Гаред, как только лес вокруг них начал темнеть. – Одичалые мертвы. – Неужели ты боишься покойников? – вопросил сир Уэймар Ройс с легким намеком на улыбку. Гаред не попался на крючок. За свои пятьдесят лет он успел навидаться, как приходят и уходят эти господа. – Мертвый мертв, – отвечал он. – С ним не о чем говорить. – А они действительно мертвы? – спросил Ройс. – Какие доказательства есть у нас? – Уилл видел их, – отвечал Гаред. – И если он говорит, что они мертвы, мне других доказательств не нужно. Уилл знал, что его рано или поздно вовлекут в разговор, и хотел, чтобы это случилось по возможности позже. – Мать моя говорила мне, что покойник не запоет, – сказал он. – То же самое говорила моя няня, – отозвался Ройс. – Уилл, никогда не верь тому, что слышишь возле женской титьки. Есть вещи, которые можно узнать даже от мертвых. – Голос его слишком громко отдавался в сумрачном лесу. – Нам предстоит долгая дорога, – напомнил Гаред. – Восемь дней, а быть может, и девять. И ночь уже близка. Сир Уэймар Ройс поглядел на небо без всякого интереса. – Ночь каждый день приходит примерно в это же время. Неужели тьма лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? Уилл увидел, как напрягся рот Гареда, как сверкнул едва сдерживаемый гнев в глазах под толстым черным капюшоном плаща. Сорок лет – юность и зрелость – провел Гаред в Ночном Дозоре, и свое прошлое он уважал. Однако здесь крылось нечто большее. Под раненой гордостью старшего Уилл угадывал нервное напряжение, опасно приближающееся к страху. Уилл разделял это нелегкое чувство. На Стене он провел четыре года. И когда в первый раз отправился за нее, то сразу вспомнил все старые россказни и чрево его обратилось в воду. Потом, вспоминая первую вылазку, он смеялся. Сотня походов сделала его ветераном, и бесконечная мрачная чаща, которую южане зовут Зачарованным лесом, более не казалась ему ужасной. Но не сегодня. Сегодняшний вечер сулил иное. В этой тьме таилось нечто, заставлявшее подниматься волосы на его затылке. Девять дней они ехали на север, потом на северо-запад и снова на север, все дальше от Стены, преследуя банду дикарей-налетчиков. Каждый день был хуже предшествовавшего ему. И нынешний стал наихудшим. С севера задувал холодный ветер, деревья шелестели, словно живые. Весь день Уиллу казалось, что за ним следит нечто холодное и непреклонное, совершенно не испытывающее к нему симпатии. Гаред ощущал то же самое. Уилл хотел одного – броситься во всю конскую прыть под защиту Стены, но подобными чувствами не делятся со своим командиром. В особенности с таким командиром. Сир Уэймар Ройс был самым молодым отпрыском древнего рода, одним из многочисленных наследников. Симпатичный юноша лет восемнадцати, сероглазый, изящный и стройный, как клинок. Восседая на спине своего рослого вороного боевого коня, рыцарь возвышался над Уиллом и Гаредом на их невысоких дорожных лошадках. Все на нем: черные кожаные сапоги, черные шерстяные штаны, черные перчатки из кротовых шкурок и тонко выделанная куртка из блестящих черных кольчужных колец, нашитых на стеганые слои черной шерсти и вареной кожи, – говорило о принадлежности к Ночному Дозору. Сир Уэймар присягнул на верность братству менее полугода назад, и никто не мог сказать, что он не был подготовлен для такого занятия. Во всяком случае, если говорить о его гардеробе. Довершал одеяние плащ. Соболиный, толстый, черный и соблазнительно мягкий. – Клянется, что сам убил всех зверьков, вот так вот, – показывал Гаред в казарме за вином. – Свернул им головенки наш могучий воитель. Все дружно хохотали. Трудно повиноваться человеку, которого осмеиваешь за выпивкой, думал Уилл, ежившийся на спине своей лошаденки. Гаред, должно быть, испытывал те же чувства. – Мормонт приказал нам выследить их, и мы это сделали, – проговорил Гаред. – Одичалые мертвы. Более они не причинят хлопот. А нам предстоит тяжелая дорога. Мне не нравится погода. Если пойдет снег, на возвращение домой уйдет две недели, а ведь даже снегопад будет подарком. Вы когда-нибудь видели ледяную бурю, милорд? Лорденыш как будто и не слышал его. Ройс изучал сгущающийся сумрак в этакой полурассеянности-полускуке. Уилл успел достаточно долго проездить с рыцарем и знал – лучше не докучать ему в подобном настроении. – Опиши мне еще раз то, что ты видел, Уилл. Все подробности. Ничего не забудь. Прежде чем поступить в Ночной Дозор, Уилл был охотником, точнее говоря, браконьером. Вольные всадники Маллистеров взяли его с кровью на руках в собственных лесах Маллистеров, над освежеванной тушей одного из оленей, принадлежавших Маллистерам; так что ему осталось или надеть черное, или расстаться с рукой. Никто не умел двигаться по лесу безмолвнее Уилла, и Черные Братья весьма скоро обнаружили этот дар. – Их лагерь располагается в двух милях отсюда, за тем гребнем, возле ручья, – проговорил Уилл. – Я подобрался так близко, как только осмелился. Одичалых – восьмеро, есть и мужчины, и женщины. Я не видел там никаких детей. Они соорудили навес возле скалы. Теперь все засыпал снег, но я не заметил огня, хотя кострище было видно как на ладони. Никто не двигался, а ведь я долго следил за ними. Живому человеку не под силу пролежать так, не шевелясь. – А ты видел кровь? – Нет, – признал Уилл. – А оружие? – Несколько мечей и луков. У одного был топор, тяжелый такой, с двумя лезвиями… жестокое железо. Он лежал на земле возле этого человека, прямо у руки. – А ты заметил положение тел? Уилл пожал плечами: – Один сидел возле скалы. Остальные были на земле, попопадали, что ли. – Или спали, – предположил Ройс. – Упали, – настаивал Уилл. – Женщина влезла наверх железного дерева и пряталась среди ветвей. Дозорная. – Он тонко улыбнулся. – Я старался, чтобы она не увидела меня. Но когда подобрался ближе, то заметил, что и она не шевелится. – И против желания он поежился. – Тебе холодно? – спросил Ройс. – Слегка, – пробормотал Уилл. – Ветер, милорд. Молодой рыцарь повернулся к седому оруженосцу. Побитые морозом листья с шелестом пролетели мимо, и конь Ройса беспокойно шевельнулся. – Итак, какова, по-твоему, была причина смерти этих людей, Гаред? – непринужденно спросил сир Уэймар, поправляя длинный соболиный плащ. – Холод, – отвечал Гаред с железной уверенностью. – Прошлой зимой я видел, как замерзают люди, видел и позапрошлой, когда был еще наполовину мальчишкой. Все говорят о снегах глубиной в сорок футов, о том, как ледяной ветер, воя, налетает с севера, но главным врагом является холод. Он добирается до тебя бесшумнее, чем Уилл, и сперва ты только поеживаешься и стучишь зубами, а потом топаешь ногами и мечтаешь о подогретом вине с пряностями и чудесном жарком очаге. Мороз жжет. Ничто не обжигает, как холод. Но лишь поначалу. А потом он проникает внутрь тела, наполняет тебя, пока у человека не остается сил сопротивляться. Легче просто сесть и уснуть. Говорят, что, замерзая, перед концом не чувствуешь никакой боли. Просто слабеешь и тихонько засыпаешь, все словно блекнет, а потом как будто проваливаешься в море теплого молока, в мир и покой. – Экое красноречие, Гаред, – усмехнулся сир Уэймар. – Никогда не подозревал в тебе подобного дара. – Холод проникал и в меня, молодой лорд. – Гаред откинул назад капюшон, давая сиру Уэймару возможность рассмотреть обрубки, оставшиеся на месте ушей. – Два уха, три пальца на ногах и мизинец на левой руке. Я еще легко отделался. Моего брата тогда нашли замерзшим и улыбающимся. Сир Уэймар пожал плечами: – Надо было одеться потеплее, Гаред. Тот гневно глянул на юного лорда, шрамы на месте ушей, там, где мейстер Эйемон срезал обмороженный хрящ, налились кровью от гнева. – Посмотрим, как согреет тебя одежда, когда придет зима. – Он натянул на голову капюшон и сгорбился на своей лошади, угрюмый и молчаливый. – Если Гаред говорит, что было холодно… – начал Уилл. – А ты был в карауле на прошлой неделе, Уилл? – Да, милорд. – Ни одна неделя не проходила без того, чтобы ему не выпадало с дюжину этих паскудных караулов. Чего, собственно, Ройс хочет от него? – И какой была Стена? – Мокрой, – сказал Уилл хмурясь. Теперь он понял, чего добивается молодой лорд. – Они не могли замерзнуть. Ведь Стена подтаяла. Настоящего холода не было. Ройс кивнул: – Смышленый парень. На этой неделе несколько раз подмораживало, выпадал снег, но холодов, достаточно свирепых, чтобы убить восьмерых взрослых людей, не было. Напоминаю: одетых в меха и кожу, возле укрытия и костра. – Улыбка рыцаря сделалась самоуверенной. – Уилл, веди нас туда, я сам хочу увидеть этих мертвецов. Ну что ж, делать нечего. Приказ отдан, надо повиноваться. Уилл направился первым, его косматая невысокая лошадка внимательно выбирала путь через подлесок. Позапрошлой ночью выпал легкий снежок, и камни, корни и ямки прятались под его поверхностью, поджидая неосторожного и беспечного. Сир Уэймар Ройс следовал за ним, рослый вороной жеребец нетерпеливо фыркал. Боевой конь не годился для разведки, но попробуй это сказать его лордству. Гаред замыкал линию. Старый оруженосец что-то бурчал под нос. Сумерки сгущались. Неласковое небо сперва приняло глубокий пурпурный оттенок, потом цвет старого синяка и, наконец, почернело. Начали выступать звезды. Над деревьями объявился и полумесяц. Уилл обрадовался свету. – Можно бы и прибавить шагу, – заметил Ройс, когда луна поднялась повыше. – Я не уверен, – отвечал Уилл. Страх заставил его забыть про вежливость. – Быть может, милорд хочет возглавить нас? Сир Уэймар Ройс не потрудился ответить. Где-то вдалеке в лесу завыл волк. Уилл завел свою лошадь под ствол, древний и корявый, и спешился. – Почему ты остановился? – спросил сир Уэймар. – Остаток пути лучше пройти пешком, милорд. Место как раз за гребнем. Вглядываясь вдаль, Ройс помедлил, на мгновение остановившись в явной задумчивости. Холодный ветер прошелестел в деревьях, толстый меховой плащ рыцаря словно бы сам собой шевельнулся сзади. – Здесь что-то неладно, – пробормотал Гаред. Молодой рыцарь посмотрел на него с презрительной улыбкой: – В самом деле? – Неужели вы не ощущаете сами? – спросил Гаред. – Прислушайтесь к тьме. Уилл чувствовал это. За все четыре года, проведенных в Ночном Дозоре, ему никогда не приводилось так пугаться. Что это такое? – Дует ветер. Деревья шелестят. Волк воет. Какой звук лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? – Не дождавшись ответа, Ройс изящно выскользнул из седла. Он надежно привязал скакуна к низкому суку, чуть в стороне от остальных, и извлек из ножен длинный меч. На рукоятке блеснули самоцветы, лунный свет пробежал по сверкающей стали. Великолепное оружие, выкованное в замке, и не столь уж давно, если как следует приглядеться. Только вот едва ли им замахивались в гневе, решил Уилл. – Здесь всюду деревья, – предостерег Уилл. – Меч помешает вам, милорд. Лучше возьмите нож. – Если мне потребуются наставления, я попрошу их, – сказал молодой лорд. – Гаред, оставайся здесь. Охраняй коней. Гаред спешился. – Нам нужен огонь. Я разведу костер. – Какой же ты дурак, старик! Если по этому лесу бродят враги, значит, в огне мы нуждаемся в самую последнюю очередь. – Бывает, что врагов огонь удерживает в стороне, – проговорил Гаред. – Его боятся медведи и лютоволки… да и другие… Рот сира Уэймара сложился в прямую линию: – Никакого огня! Капюшон Гареда прикрыл лицо, но, поворачиваясь к рыцарю, Уилл заметил в глазах старика жесткий блеск. На миг он испугался, что Гаред достанет свой меч… короткая уродливая штуковина, рукоятка изъедена по́том, лезвие притуплено долгим употреблением… Уилл не дал бы железного шиллинга за жизнь лорденыша, если бы Гаред извлек свой клинок из ножен. Наконец Гаред поглядел вниз. – Никакого огня, – пробормотал он едва слышным голосом. Ройс принял это за подтверждение и отвернулся. – Ступай, – сказал он Уиллу. Уилл направился в чащу, потом вверх по склону к высокому гребню, где он обнаружил удобное место под страж-деревом. Тонкая корочка снега едва прикрывала грязь и влагу, ноги скользили – мешали камни и скрытые корни, – однако, поднимаясь, Уилл не произвел ни звука. За его спиной негромко позвякивал кольчугой лорденок, шелестели листья, раздавались негромкие ругательства, когда загребущие ветви цеплялись за длинный меч и за великолепный соболий плащ. Огромное страж-дерево находилось прямо на гребне; как помнил Уилл, нижние ветви его поднимались от земли почти на фут. Уилл скользнул под дерево, лег на живот в снег и грязь, поглядел на пустую поляну внизу, и сердце его провалилось в пятки. Мгновение он не смел дохнуть. Луна освещала поляну, кострище, занесенный снегом навес, огромную скалу, маленький узкий полузамерзший ручеек. Все это осталось неизменным – как и несколько часов назад. Но людей не было, все тела исчезли. – Ах, боги! – услышал он позади себя голос. Меч рубанул по ветке, и сир Уэймар Ройс поднялся на гребень. Он остановился возле страж-дерева с мечом в руках, ветер раздувал плащ, все вокруг могли видеть благородный силуэт на фоне звездного неба. – Немедленно вниз! – настоятельно шепнул Уилл. – Здесь что-то не так. Ройс не шевельнулся. Он поглядел на пустую прогалину и расхохотался: – Выходит, твои мертвецы куда-то перебрались. Голос Уилла предал его. Он искал слова и не находил их. Немыслимо! Глаза его метались взад и вперед по покинутому стану и остановились на топоре. Огромный боевой топор с двумя лезвиями все еще лежал на прежнем месте. Ценное оружие… – На ноги, Уилл, – приказал сир Уэймар. – Здесь никого нет. Я не хочу, чтобы ты прятался под кустом. Уилл нерешительно поднял голову. Сир Уэймар глядел на него с открытым неодобрением. – Я не намереваюсь вернуться в Черный замок с признанием о неудаче моей первой вылазки. Мы найдем этих людей. – Он огляделся. – Лезь на дерево. И быстро. Ищи огонь. Уилл молча отвернулся, спорить было бесполезно. Ветер менялся. Теперь порывы продували насквозь. Уилл подошел к дереву, высоко поднимавшему свои серо-зеленые ветви, и полез вверх. Скоро руки его запачкались смолой, и он почти потерялся среди иголок. Страх наполнил нутро Уилла комом непереваренной пищи. Прочитав молитву безымянным богам леса, он извлек свой кинжал из ножен и зажал в зубах, чтобы можно было держаться за дерево обеими руками. Вкус холодного железа во рту почему-то всегда успокаивал его. Лорденыш внизу вдруг воскликнул: – Кто идет? Уилл услышал неуверенность в его голосе и замер, прислушиваясь и наблюдая. Лес дал ответ: шелестели листья, в ледяном ложе бежал ручей, вдалеке кричала снежная сова. Иные не издают звуков. Уилл заметил движение уголком глаза. Бледные силуэты появились в лесу. Повернув голову, он увидел белую тень, скользнувшую во тьме. Тень исчезла. Ветки легко шевелились под ветром, скребли друг друга деревянными пальцами. Уилл открыл рот, чтобы выкрикнуть предупреждение, но слова как будто замерзли в его горле. Возможно, он ошибся, и это всего лишь птица или отражение, брошенное на снег прихотью лунного света. В конце концов, что он видел? – Уилл, где ты? – поднял голову вверх сир Уэймар. – Ты заметил что-нибудь? – Зажав в руке меч, рыцарь медленно, с внезапным напряжением повернулся на месте. Значит, и он ощутил их. Ощутил, но не увидел. – Отвечай мне! Почему так холодно? Было действительно холодно. Ежась, Уилл плотнее прижался к стволу, припав лицом к грубой коре. Сладко пахло смолой, прилипшей к щеке. Из тьмы леса родилась тень и остановилась перед Ройсом. Высокая, тощая и твердая, как старые кости, и вместе с тем бледная, как молоко. Панцирь ее словно менял цвет при каждом движении. Он то становился белым, как свежевыпавший снег, то покрывался угольной тенью, то отливал серой зеленью деревьев. С каждым шагом новый узор пробегал по броне, словно лунный свет по воде. Уилл услышал, как дыхание с долгим шипением вырвалось из груди сира Уэймара Ройса. – Стой! – выкрикнул лорденыш, дав петуха как мальчишка. Забросив длинный соболий плащ за плечи, он освободил обе руки для боя и взял меч. Ветер утих, но сделалось еще холоднее. Иной скользил вперед, бесшумно ступая; в руке существо держало длинный меч. Таких клинков Уилл никогда не видел. Ни один известный людям металл не мог бы пойти на это лезвие. Играя в лунном свете, меч казался прозрачной полоской тонкого хрусталя и почти исчезал, поворачиваясь плоскостью. Он горел призрачным голубым пламенем, и чутье поведало Уиллу, что более острого клинка ему еще не встречалось. – Ну что ж, попляшем и согреемся, – пробормотал сир Уэймар и занес свой меч над головой. Руки его дрожали от тяжести оружия или, может быть, от холода. И все же в тот момент Уилл увидел в нем не прежнего мальчика, но мужа из Ночного Дозора. Иной остановился, и Уилл заметил глаза существа: глубокая и густая нечеловеческая синева сверкала как лед. Они были обращены к длинному мечу, занесенному над головой, и лунный свет леденил металл. На миг Уилл потерял надежду. Они безмолвно возникали из теней двойниками первого. Их было трое… четверо… пятеро… Сир Уэймар, должно быть, ощущал холод, который принесли Иные, но не видел их, даже не слышал. Уиллу следовало бы крикнуть. Но, выполняя свой долг, он лишь навлек бы на себя несомненную смерть. Трепеща, Уилл только теснее обнял дерево, сохраняя молчание. Бледный меч холодом пронзил воздух. Сир Уэймар встретил удар сталью. Клинки соприкоснулись не со звоном металла о металл: в воздухе проплыл тонкий стон животного, получившего смертельную рану. Ройс отразил и второй удар, и третий, а затем отступил на шаг. Последовал еще поток ударов, и он снова отступил. Позади него, справа, слева, вокруг стояли терпеливые, безликие и безмолвные наблюдатели, текучие узоры на хрупкой броне делали их в лесу почти невидимыми. И все же они не пытались вмешаться. Вновь и вновь встречались мечи. Уиллу захотелось зажать уши, только бы не слышать этот странный болезненный визг. Сир Уэймар теперь пыхтел от натуги, дыхание паром струилось в лунном свете. Его клинок побелел от мороза. Иной же плясал вокруг с бледным голубым пламенем в руках. А потом удар Ройса чуть запоздал. Бледный меч прорезал его кольчугу на боку. Молодой лорд вскрикнул от боли. Кровь хлынула между колец. Она задымилась на холоде, красные как огонь капли падали на снег. Пальцы сира Уэймара зажали бок, на кротовой перчатке выступила кровь. Иной что-то сказал: языка Уилл не знал, голос чужака трещал словно лед на зимнем озере, но в словах слышалась насмешка. К сиру Уэймару вновь вернулась ярость. – За короля Роберта! – закричал он и отчаянно бросился вперед, обеими руками занес покрытый изморозью меч и рубанул им сбоку, вложив в удар вес всего тела. Иной ответил небрежным ленивым движением. Клинки соприкоснулись, и сталь разбилась. С визгом, отозвавшимся в ночном лесу, длинный меч рассыпался на сотню хрупких иголок, дождем разлетевшихся вокруг. Ройс упал на колени, с криком прижимая руку к глазам. Кровь проступала между его пальцев. Безмолвные наблюдатели разом шагнули вперед, словно получив какой-то сигнал. Мечи поднимались и падали в смертельном безмолвии. Началась хладнокровная бойня. Бледные клинки прорезали кольчугу, словно какой-то шелк. Уилл закрыл глаза. Голоса их и смех, колючий словно сосульки, раздавались где-то под ним. Не скоро он накопил достаточно отваги, чтобы поглядеть вниз, даже когда гребень уже опустел. Едва смея дышать, Уилл еще долго оставался на дереве, и луна медленно ползла по черному небу. Наконец мышцы его окоченели, пальцы онемели от холода, и он стал спускаться. Тело Ройса лежало лицом в снег, одна рука была протянута в сторону, толстый соболий плащ прорезан в дюжине мест. Было видно, насколько он молод. Мальчишка. Уилл нашел остатки меча чуть в стороне: клинок расщепился и изогнулся, напоминая дерево, пораженное ударом молнии. Став на колени, Уилл осторожно огляделся вокруг и подобрал оружие. Расщепленный клинок послужит доказательством его слов. Гаред знает, что все это значит, а если нет, то поймет старый медведь Мормонт или мейстер Эйемон. Ждет ли его еще Гаред с лошадьми? Надо торопиться. Уилл поднялся. Над ним высился сир Уэймар Ройс. Тонкие одежды разодраны, лицо разбито. Осколок торчал из ослепленной левой глазницы. Правый глаз был открыт. Зрачок его горел синим огнем и… видел. Сломанный меч упал из бесчувственных пальцев. Уилл закрыл глаза, чтобы помолиться. Длинные благородные пальцы коснулись его щеки, стиснули горло. Уилл ощутил прикосновение тончайшей выделки кротовой кожи, липкой от крови. Но прикосновение оказалось ледяным. Текст 2: Пролог В городе, который некогда назывался Кабитэла, а ныне — Оллария, цвела сирень. Ее белые и лиловые свечи, как и положено горящим свечам, были обречены. Обречены были и воркующие на крышах голуби, и суетящиеся на улицах люди, и сам этот мир, но неизбежность конца придавала весеннему городу некое горькое очарование. Трудно любить то, что всегда было и всегда будет, зато осознание того, что «это в последний раз», оживляет притупившиеся чувства, и ты замечаешь вещи, которые раньше не замечал, и сердце твое разрывается от любви и боли. Одинокий в последний раз шел улицами Олларии — этот мир становился опасен. Скоро старая, добрая Кэртиана будет вотчиной раттонов, пройдет еще несколько веков, и то, во что превратится некогда вольный и радостный мир, придется уничтожить. Из великого Ожерелья выпадет еще одна бусина — не столь уж и страшная потеря, ведь сама Нить уцелеет. Шедший цветущим городом гость понимал, что беда случится не завтра. То, что для него было «скоро», для смертных означало почти «никогда». Люди, спешащие по своим делам и странным образом не замечающие высокого чужака, успеют долюбить, досуетиться, доненавидеть, равно, как и их дети, внуки и правнуки. И все равно Одинокому было мучительно жаль исполненный жизни город с его каштанами и сиренью, щебечущими скворцами, красными черепичными крышами и булыжными мостовыми. Люди… Одинокий усмехнулся — он ведь тоже БЫЛ человеком. Был, пока не прошел Костры Этерны. Его никто не вынуждал — в пламя Этерны нельзя ни столкнуть, ни заманить. Он сам выбрал свою судьбу, согласившись умереть, чтоб воскреснуть Стражем Заката, вечным воином и странником, давшим клятву хранить Ожерелье. Одинокий не знал, как и где начался его путь, — Нить длинна, а его память сгорела в вихре лилового огня, огня цвета увядающей сирени. Нет, он ни в чем не раскаивался и ни о чем не жалел, — бесконечный бой, в котором не может быть победы, стал его прошлым, настоящим и будущим, не оставив места для сомнений и тоски, но в некоторых мирах страннику хотелось задержаться. Одинокий полагал, что эти миры чем-то напоминали его прежнюю родину, но чем — не знал и не мог знать. Все, что случилось до того, как будущий Страж Заката шагнул в лиловый костер и адская боль разорвала в клочья сознание, исчезло. Это было разумно — прошлое имеет над нами слишком большую власть. Те, кто держит на плечах небо, должны быть свободны от былых привязанностей и долгов, но весенняя Кэртиана пьянила и печалила. Может, все дело было в цветущих каштанах и сирени, а может, в чужих улыбках или в стремительных острокрылых ласточках… Одинокий протянул руку, и могучий каштан медленно склонил ветви навстречу чужаку. Сильные пальцы легко коснулись цветочной грозди, и путник чему-то улыбнулся, по-кошачьи сощурившись. Он мог обернуться стариком, юношей, женщиной, леопардом, драконом, наконец, но предпочитал оставаться самим собой. Внешность — единственное, что оставил ему лиловый огонь. Страж Заката надеялся, что кто-то когда-то любил его именно таким. Или ненавидел. Одинокий не сомневался, что всегда был воином, но все остальное… Было ли ему что терять? Хотелось верить, что было. Иногда он пытался придумать себе человеческое прошлое, счастье, от которого отказался, последовав за позвавшей его адой, но выдумки или таяли, как облака, или жгли, как раскаленное железо. Вечный воин, он сочинял сказки о великой любви и преданной дружбе, а они не сочинялись. Он видел себя умирающим от удара в спину, ожидающим пыток и казни, скитающимся в чужих краях, идущим сквозь чужую зависть, злобу, презрение, но не счастливым. Отчего-то казалось, что в его жизни ненависти было больше, чем любви, а боли больше, чем радости, и все равно Одинокий предпочел бы помнить все. Колокольный перезвон вернул странника на землю Кэртианы. Смертные всегда и всюду просят небожителей о милости, не зная, что боги погибли, а те, кто принял их ношу, не имеют ни сил, ни возможности снисходить к человеческим просьбам. Чуждое не оставляет попыток поглотить Ожерелье, а противостоят растущему напору лишь Одинокие. Их дело — сражаться, и, пока они бьются, смертным отвечают раттоны, будь они трижды прокляты! Одинокий отпустил ветку и двинулся дальше, смешавшись с изливающимся из храма людским потоком. Его не замечали, не «не видели», а именно не замечали, зато он замечал все, — ведь он видел Кэртиану в последний раз, Кэртиану, которая тысячи лет была его «поляной в лесу», местом, к которому тянулось его сердце. Залечив раны и набравшись сил, он прежде, чем вернуться в бой, проходил через этот мир, запоминая женский смех и детские крики. Одинокий не создавал Кэртиану и не был ею создан, но ему хотелось любить, и он полюбил этот мир и, защищая Ожерелье, защищал в первую очередь его. Кэртиана жила и дышала за его спиной, так было, но так больше не будет. Он не вправе позволить раттонам отыскать свои следы — Осень слишком драгоценна, чтобы рисковать ею. Осень дороже Кэртианы, а Ожерелье дороже одной из бусин. Когда Этерна была цела, они сражались за каждый из миров Ожерелья. Теперешних сил едва хватает, чтобы сдерживать Чуждое на Новом Рубеже. Раньше Одинокие вмешивались в дела смертных, называвших их кто богами, кто демонами, теперь в прошлом и это. В прошлом все, кроме боя. Когда падет последний защитник, придет конец и Ожерелью, только раттонам этого не понять. Они вообще мало что понимают, эти возомнившие себя богами ничтожества. Играя в свои игры, они подгрызают Нить, невольно помогая тому или тем, кто рвется к ней снаружи. Теперь они подняли голову и в Кэртиане. Одинокий медленно шел по залитым солнцем улицам, наслаждаясь тем, что ступает по твердой земле, дышит полной грудью, видит цветы и улыбки. Грязь, старость, несправедливость никуда не исчезли, но он старался не думать о них, так же как и о раттонах. Твари еще не вошли в полную силу, Кэртиана не знает, что смертельно больна, и в этом ее счастье. Если б он мог задержаться! Но каждый должен делать то, что за него не сделает никто. Место Одинокого — его бой на Рубеже. Внутренние Миры выживают или погибают сами и по своей вине. Смертные наделены волей и разумом, они могут и должны дать отпор раттонам, а не идти у них на поводу, но как им это объяснишь?! Он несколько раз пробовал говорить с людьми — его не понимали. Улица заканчивалась у старинной стены, к которой лепились торговые ряды. Оллария поглотила старую Кабитэлу. Новое или поглощает старое, или убивает. Когда-то здесь расстилались ржаные поля, которые топтали воины Франциска Оллара, бастарда, пожелавшего стать великим королем и ставшего им. Губы Одинокого скривились в усмешке. Откуда у него привычка улыбаться и даже смеяться, когда на сердце особенно мерзко, Страж Заката не знал. Возможно, это тень его старой жизни. Магия Этерны была сильна, но даже она не уничтожила всего. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но его притягивали или, наоборот, отталкивали некоторые звуки, запахи, лица. Вот и тот рыцарь, которому он сказал, что совесть выше и чести, и закона, почему он заговорил именно с ним? Сколько лет прошло! Почему ему до сих пор больно вспоминать, чем все закончилось? Кэртианца давным-давно нет на свете, а Одинокий все ищет для него слова и доводы, ищет и не находит. И все равно случившееся тогда отобрало у раттонов несколько веков. Для Ожерелья — миг, для Кэртианы — жизнь восьми или десяти поколений. Жаль только, что тот, кто подарил своему миру четыреста лет свободы, не дождался ни благодарности, ни понимания… Толпившиеся на улице горожане расступились, пропуская красивого всадника на породистой вороной кобыле, и Одинокий невольно залюбовался. Человек был счастлив, как может быть счастлив лишь… человек, живущий единым, сверкающим мигом. Он любил и был любим — Одинокий понял это сразу. Захваченный волной чужой радости, странник не сразу почуял приглушенную ненависть. За влюбленным следили. Кто? Соперник? Муж? Или эта злоба не имеет ничего общего с чужим счастьем? Похоже на то, уж больно она холодна и расчетлива. Страж Заката пожал плечами, мысленно пожелав неведомому всаднику избежать удара в спину, и сразу же забыл и о нем, и о его враге. Этот вечер принадлежал ему, и он хотел провести его так, словно сам был плотью от плоти этого мира. Ожерелье, Рубеж, бой без надежды и без конца — все это нет, не исчезло, но словно бы отодвинулось. Одинокий чувствовал себя свободным и смертным, он даже позволил себе зайти в таверну и сесть в углу, куда немедленно принесли кувшин с вином, после чего никто и не подумал взглянуть в сторону странного посетителя. Люди приходили и уходили, а Одинокий смотрел на них — пьющих, смеющихся, поющих… Откуда-то вылезла маленькая пятнистая кошка, почти котенок, и остановилась, нерешительно глядя на гостя. Кошка — не человек, ей глаза не отведешь. Эти маленькие вольные твари не только чуют всех, владеющих магией, но и сами ей сопричастны, потому-то раттоны их и ненавидят. И ненависть эта взаимна. Если кошек начинают гнать, проклинать, называть нечистыми, предавшимися злу тварями, ищи поблизости раттонов. Одинокий поднял бровь, и кошка, расценив это как приглашение, прыгнула ему на колени. В зверьке билась магическая искра, маленькая и слабая, но отчетливая. Кошки понимают, что ждет Кэртиану. Кошки, но не люди. Воин успел застать создателей этого мира. Их было четверо, и они откликнулись на призыв Этерны и ушли на Рубеж, поручив Кэртиану своим избранникам из числа смертных. Человеческой памяти хватило на три тысячи лет. Не так уж и мало, если вспомнить, что люди редко живут дольше семидесяти… Правнукам нынешних гуляк придется туго — раттоны убивают чужую радость, может быть, потому, что сами на нее не способны. Зависть, злоба, страх — это да, это по ним, но радости этим существам не отпущено. Только злорадство. Возможно, их стоит пожалеть, но Одинокий, если б мог, перебил их всех. Если б мог… Здешним обитателям и не снилась мощь, которой он обладал. Страж Заката мог уничтожить Кэртиану и боялся, что испить эту чашу доведется именно ему. В его власти уничтожить, но не спасти. Как легко сжечь зачумленный город и этим остановить заразу, но кто возьмется одолеть беду, выловив всех чумных крыс? А раттоны — чумные крысы Ожерелья, их становится все больше, а Одиноких все меньше! Кошка, почуяв его ярость, вздрогнула и прижала уши. Она знала, как сражаться с крысами, если б ее сородичи были покрупнее и посильнее, если б их удалось объединить и натравить на этих, с позволения сказать, новых владык, но увы! Страж Заката взял кубок и поднес к кошачьей морде. Зверушка брезгливо сморщила нос и отодвинулась. Пробовать вино она не собиралась, и Одинокий выпил сам. В память первых богов Кэртианы! Они были готовы умереть на Рубеже, а смерть настигла их в Этерне, казавшейся самым безопасным местом Ожерелья. Тогда погибли многие и вместе с ними погибла надежда. Одинокий залпом допил вино, словно ему, теперешнему, это могло помочь. Вечер продолжался. Играла музыка, танцевала черноволосая девушка в алой, низко вырезанной блузке, а он видел шар ревущего пламени, чудовищную звезду, родившуюся из гибели Этерны. Нет, это было потом, конь его судьбы свернул с общей дороги раньше. …Они стояли под серебристым мертвым небом без солнца и птиц, а Пепельное море лениво переливало у их ног тяжелые, медленные волны. Казалось, Чуждое устало рваться вперед, его напор ослабел. Уходившие в Этерну шутили, что отдыхать можно и на Рубеже, и они готовы остаться. Потом камни на мечах вспыхнули лиловыми звездами, предупреждая о том, что Чуждое шевельнулось. Приближался бой — один из множества, — ничего выдающегося, сколько таких было, и сколько еще будет. Горизонт набухал похожими на гарадских итаров тучами, предвещая бурю, которую предстояло остановить. Шторм надвигался медленно и неотвратимо, нападавшие и обороняющие в тысячный раз готовились помериться силами, заранее зная, что они равны. Стратег остающихся нехорошо улыбнулся, приветствуя подползавшего врага, небо стало ниже, море с шумом отступало, обнажая скалистое дно. Ни водорослей, ни раковин, ни бьющейся на мели рыбы. Только серый, отливающий сталью камень… — Нам пора, — Одинокий забыл, кто произнес эти слова, — это не наш бой. Бой и вправду был не их. Они сделали свое дело и могли возвращаться в Этерну, но он избрал другую дорогу. Дворец Архонта с его вечными празднествами в честь вернувшихся с Рубежа и уходящих на Рубеж был хорош, но Одинокий не любил пиров, можно даже сказать, ненавидел. Видимо, это тоже выползло из его убитого прошлого. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но каждая поднятая в высоких чертогах чаша отзывалась в сердце звериной тоской. Одинокий любил своих товарищей, любовался адами, верил Архонту и Стратегам, но их буйное веселье было не по нему. Похоже, он стал Одиноким до того, как это слово сорвалось с губ последней уцелевшей ады. Как бы то ни было, ненависть к пирам его и спасла. Убегая от ненавистной радости, он забрел сюда, в Кэртиану, где его и застиг зов. Рубеж просил помощи, и было некогда думать, что там происходит. Он бросился назад… Одинокий с силой сжал пустой кубок, вспоминая непосильную тяжесть, словно ему, как герою легенды, и впрямь пришлось взвалить на плечи небесный свод. Рядом кто-то упал, груз стал еще неподъемней, он стиснул зубы, заставляя себя держаться. Сгоревшие Миры, по которым пролегал Рубеж, были мертвы, их можно было оставить без особого риска, но, единожды отступив, отступишь снова, и он держался, они все держались… Чуждое наконец схлынуло, как всегда, рассыпавшись стаей странных, смертных созданий, на сей раз похожих на летучих медуз. Полупрозрачная мерзость сама бросалась на мечи, словно желая побыстрее со всем покончить. Одинокому показалось, что бой длился дольше, чем обычно, но, возможно, он просто устал. — В Этерне решили, что мы испугались собственной тени? — недовольно бросил бившийся рядом Стратег, разрубая слизистый гриб. — Я не был там. — Одинокий отшвырнул студенистое полушарие. — Не понимаю. Нас не услышали? Или что-то стряслось в самой Этерне? Тогда это показалось бредом. Что могло стрястись в месте, исполненном великой Силы, покорной Архонту и его сподвижникам? Нет, это невиданная доселе схватка приглушила Зов, и он не достиг цели. — Как бы то ни было, я должен говорить с Архонтом, — бросил Стратег, оглядывая из-под руки серебристый горизонт, — и я буду говорить с ним. Поговорить с Архонтом Стратегу не удалось — Этерны больше не существовало. Что именно произошло, уцелевшие так никогда и не узнали. Был ли это заговор, неосторожность, несчастливая случайность или же сработал доселе неведомый закон мироздания, но произошло то, что произошло. Те, кого в час беды не оказалось в Этерне, собрались на Рубеже. Их было больше, чем они боялись, и меньше, чем надеялись. Выжившие могли держать Рубеж, но не создавать миры и не одаривать избранных бессмертием и силой. Одинокий навеки запомнил глаза Стратега — исполненные боли и тревоги глаза воина, осознавшего, что ему не дождаться ни помощи, ни приказа, что все смотрят на него и отныне от него зависит исход войны… Стратег стал Архонтом, а все они — Одинокими, не загадывавшими дальше грядущей схватки. Рано или поздно Чуждое прорвет оборону и набросится на внутренние миры, впрочем, в последнее время Одинокий стал опасаться, что раттоны погубят Ожерелье прежде, чем падет Рубеж. …Крик был неожиданным и страшным. Это не было зовом в прямом смысле этого слова, но Одинокий вскочил, сбросив на пол раздосадованную кошку. Неподалеку шел неравный бой — кто-то в одиночку отбивался от множества убийц. Страж Заката чувствовал их ярость, удивление и, наконец, страх. Тот, на кого напали, был обречен, но он дрался и как дрался! Одинокий словно бы вживую увидел большую, тускло освещенную комнату, опрокинутую, разбитую мебель, мечущиеся силуэты, чьи-то глаза, белые от ярости… Странно, он ведь отгородился от чужих мыслей и чувств, и отгородился надежно, в чем же дело? Раттоны? Нет, тут они ни при чем. Страж Заката, по-прежнему никем не примеченный, выбежал на улицу. Город спал или делал вид, что спит, было тихо, но Одинокий не сомневался — рядом убивают. Более того, он знал, кого именно — всадника, встреченного им на площади. Те, кто за ним следил, времени зря не теряли. Где-то завыла собака, хлопнула дверь, в окне напротив задули свечу. Воин пожал плечами и быстро пошел по пустынному переулку. Зачем ему это? Люди вечно враждуют, а если не могут справиться с противником в открытом бою, бьют в спину. Кэртиана не исключение, скоро здесь и вовсе начнется война всех со всеми. Война, в которой не будет победителей, кроме раттонов. Переулок влился в тихую улицу, застроенную двухэтажными домами; в одном из них погибал человек, чья неистовая радость разбудила в Одиноком то, что, казалось, ушло навсегда. Между ним и смертным возникла ниточка, которая и привела чужака к изящному особняку, в котором шел бой. Шел, хотя должен был уже закончиться. Жалобно зазвенело разбитое окно, сквозь которое пролетел какой-то обломок, раздался крик, и ответом ему был наглухо захлопнувшийся ставень в доме напротив. Эта «хата» явно была «с краю». Снова звон, злобный вопль, глухие удары и возня внутри и мертвая тишина снаружи. Как похоже на людей… Остатки здравого смысла шептали, уговаривали, требовали оставить все, как есть. Одинокие не вмешиваются в дела смертных, Кэртиана захвачена раттонами, он не должен оставлять следов… Он их и не оставит! Зачем тратить Силу, ведь он может драться, как человек! Он это умеет, всегда умел, и будь трижды прокляты все раттоны всех миров и все запреты! Одинокий выхватил меч и пинком вышиб жалобно вскрикнувшую дверь. Текст 3: Пролог «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой...","output":"Увы, вам представлены лишь отрывки из книг, которые, возможно, являются частью произведений с авторскими правами.

Оно предоставляет различные функции, такие как настройка подсветки, присвоение макросов и управление устройствами. Что касается мониторинга звука через ASIO, то стоит отметить, что ASIO (Audio Stream Input/Output) - это протокол аудиодрайвера, предназначенный для снижения задержки и обеспечения более высокой производительности аудиоприложений. Он обычно используется музыкантами и звукоинженерами для записи и воспроизведения аудио с минимальной латентностью. SteelSeries GG само по себе не предоставляет функционал для работы с ASIO драйверами. Если вы хотите мониторить звук через ASIO, вам, вероятно, потребуется специальное программное обеспечение для работы со звуковыми интерфейсами или DAW (цифровая звуковая рабочая станция), которая поддерживает ASIO, например: 1. FL Studio 2. Ableton Live 3. Steinberg Cubase 4. PreSonus Studio One 5. и другие аналогичные приложения Чтобы настроить мониторинг в таких программных решениях: 1. Установите и запустите выбранное аудио редактор/DAW, которое поддерживает ASIO. 2. Перейдите в настройки аудио (обычно это раздел Preferences, Audio Settings или Audio Setup). 3.

Гаред не попался на крючок. За свои пятьдесят лет он успел навидаться, как приходят и уходят эти господа. – Мертвый мертв, – отвечал он. – С ним не о чем говорить. – А они действительно мертвы? – спросил Ройс. – Какие доказательства есть у нас? – Уилл видел их, – отвечал Гаред. – И если он говорит, что они мертвы, мне других доказательств не нужно. Уилл знал, что его рано или поздно вовлекут в разговор, и хотел, чтобы это случилось по возможности позже. – Мать моя говорила мне, что покойник не запоет, – сказал он. – То же самое говорила моя няня, – отозвался Ройс. – Уилл, никогда не верь тому, что слышишь возле женской титьки. Есть вещи, которые можно узнать даже от мертвых. – Голос его слишком громко отдавался в сумрачном лесу. – Нам предстоит долгая дорога, – напомнил Гаред. – Восемь дней, а быть может, и девять. И ночь уже близка. Сир Уэймар Ройс поглядел на небо без всякого интереса. – Ночь каждый день приходит примерно в это же время. Неужели тьма лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? Уилл увидел, как напрягся рот Гареда, как сверкнул едва сдерживаемый гнев в глазах под толстым черным капюшоном плаща. Сорок лет – юность и зрелость – провел Гаред в Ночном Дозоре, и свое прошлое он уважал. Однако здесь крылось нечто большее. Под раненой гордостью старшего Уилл угадывал нервное напряжение, опасно приближающееся к страху. Уилл разделял это нелегкое чувство. На Стене он провел четыре года. И когда в первый раз отправился за нее, то сразу вспомнил все старые россказни и чрево его обратилось в воду. Потом, вспоминая первую вылазку, он смеялся. Сотня походов сделала его ветераном, и бесконечная мрачная чаща, которую южане зовут Зачарованным лесом, более не казалась ему ужасной. Но не сегодня. Сегодняшний вечер сулил иное. В этой тьме таилось нечто, заставлявшее подниматься волосы на его затылке. Девять дней они ехали на север, потом на северо-запад и снова на север, все дальше от Стены, преследуя банду дикарей-налетчиков. Каждый день был хуже предшествовавшего ему. И нынешний стал наихудшим. С севера задувал холодный ветер, деревья шелестели, словно живые. Весь день Уиллу казалось, что за ним следит нечто холодное и непреклонное, совершенно не испытывающее к нему симпатии. Гаред ощущал то же самое. Уилл хотел одного – броситься во всю конскую прыть под защиту Стены, но подобными чувствами не делятся со своим командиром. В особенности с таким командиром. Сир Уэймар Ройс был самым молодым отпрыском древнего рода, одним из многочисленных наследников. Симпатичный юноша лет восемнадцати, сероглазый, изящный и стройный, как клинок. Восседая на спине своего рослого вороного боевого коня, рыцарь возвышался над Уиллом и Гаредом на их невысоких дорожных лошадках. Все на нем: черные кожаные сапоги, черные шерстяные штаны, черные перчатки из кротовых шкурок и тонко выделанная куртка из блестящих черных кольчужных колец, нашитых на стеганые слои черной шерсти и вареной кожи, – говорило о принадлежности к Ночному Дозору. Сир Уэймар присягнул на верность братству менее полугода назад, и никто не мог сказать, что он не был подготовлен для такого занятия. Во всяком случае, если говорить о его гардеробе. Довершал одеяние плащ. Соболиный, толстый, черный и соблазнительно мягкий. – Клянется, что сам убил всех зверьков, вот так вот, – показывал Гаред в казарме за вином. – Свернул им головенки наш могучий воитель. Все дружно хохотали. Трудно повиноваться человеку, которого осмеиваешь за выпивкой, думал Уилл, ежившийся на спине своей лошаденки. Гаред, должно быть, испытывал те же чувства. – Мормонт приказал нам выследить их, и мы это сделали, – проговорил Гаред. – Одичалые мертвы. Более они не причинят хлопот. А нам предстоит тяжелая дорога. Мне не нравится погода. Если пойдет снег, на возвращение домой уйдет две недели, а ведь даже снегопад будет подарком. Вы когда-нибудь видели ледяную бурю, милорд? Лорденыш как будто и не слышал его. Ройс изучал сгущающийся сумрак в этакой полурассеянности-полускуке. Уилл успел достаточно долго проездить с рыцарем и знал – лучше не докучать ему в подобном настроении. – Опиши мне еще раз то, что ты видел, Уилл. Все подробности. Ничего не забудь. Прежде чем поступить в Ночной Дозор, Уилл был охотником, точнее говоря, браконьером. Вольные всадники Маллистеров взяли его с кровью на руках в собственных лесах Маллистеров, над освежеванной тушей одного из оленей, принадлежавших Маллистерам; так что ему осталось или надеть черное, или расстаться с рукой. Никто не умел двигаться по лесу безмолвнее Уилла, и Черные Братья весьма скоро обнаружили этот дар. – Их лагерь располагается в двух милях отсюда, за тем гребнем, возле ручья, – проговорил Уилл. – Я подобрался так близко, как только осмелился. Одичалых – восьмеро, есть и мужчины, и женщины. Я не видел там никаких детей. Они соорудили навес возле скалы. Теперь все засыпал снег, но я не заметил огня, хотя кострище было видно как на ладони. Никто не двигался, а ведь я долго следил за ними. Живому человеку не под силу пролежать так, не шевелясь. – А ты видел кровь? – Нет, – признал Уилл. – А оружие? – Несколько мечей и луков. У одного был топор, тяжелый такой, с двумя лезвиями… жестокое железо. Он лежал на земле возле этого человека, прямо у руки. – А ты заметил положение тел? Уилл пожал плечами: – Один сидел возле скалы. Остальные были на земле, попопадали, что ли. – Или спали, – предположил Ройс. – Упали, – настаивал Уилл. – Женщина влезла наверх железного дерева и пряталась среди ветвей. Дозорная. – Он тонко улыбнулся. – Я старался, чтобы она не увидела меня. Но когда подобрался ближе, то заметил, что и она не шевелится. – И против желания он поежился. – Тебе холодно? – спросил Ройс. – Слегка, – пробормотал Уилл. – Ветер, милорд. Молодой рыцарь повернулся к седому оруженосцу. Побитые морозом листья с шелестом пролетели мимо, и конь Ройса беспокойно шевельнулся. – Итак, какова, по-твоему, была причина смерти этих людей, Гаред? – непринужденно спросил сир Уэймар, поправляя длинный соболиный плащ. – Холод, – отвечал Гаред с железной уверенностью. – Прошлой зимой я видел, как замерзают люди, видел и позапрошлой, когда был еще наполовину мальчишкой. Все говорят о снегах глубиной в сорок футов, о том, как ледяной ветер, воя, налетает с севера, но главным врагом является холод. Он добирается до тебя бесшумнее, чем Уилл, и сперва ты только поеживаешься и стучишь зубами, а потом топаешь ногами и мечтаешь о подогретом вине с пряностями и чудесном жарком очаге. Мороз жжет. Ничто не обжигает, как холод. Но лишь поначалу. А потом он проникает внутрь тела, наполняет тебя, пока у человека не остается сил сопротивляться. Легче просто сесть и уснуть. Говорят, что, замерзая, перед концом не чувствуешь никакой боли. Просто слабеешь и тихонько засыпаешь, все словно блекнет, а потом как будто проваливаешься в море теплого молока, в мир и покой. – Экое красноречие, Гаред, – усмехнулся сир Уэймар. – Никогда не подозревал в тебе подобного дара. – Холод проникал и в меня, молодой лорд. – Гаред откинул назад капюшон, давая сиру Уэймару возможность рассмотреть обрубки, оставшиеся на месте ушей. – Два уха, три пальца на ногах и мизинец на левой руке. Я еще легко отделался. Моего брата тогда нашли замерзшим и улыбающимся. Сир Уэймар пожал плечами: – Надо было одеться потеплее, Гаред. Тот гневно глянул на юного лорда, шрамы на месте ушей, там, где мейстер Эйемон срезал обмороженный хрящ, налились кровью от гнева. – Посмотрим, как согреет тебя одежда, когда придет зима. – Он натянул на голову капюшон и сгорбился на своей лошади, угрюмый и молчаливый. – Если Гаред говорит, что было холодно… – начал Уилл. – А ты был в карауле на прошлой неделе, Уилл? – Да, милорд. – Ни одна неделя не проходила без того, чтобы ему не выпадало с дюжину этих паскудных караулов. Чего, собственно, Ройс хочет от него? – И какой была Стена? – Мокрой, – сказал Уилл хмурясь. Теперь он понял, чего добивается молодой лорд. – Они не могли замерзнуть. Ведь Стена подтаяла. Настоящего холода не было. Ройс кивнул: – Смышленый парень. На этой неделе несколько раз подмораживало, выпадал снег, но холодов, достаточно свирепых, чтобы убить восьмерых взрослых людей, не было. Напоминаю: одетых в меха и кожу, возле укрытия и костра. – Улыбка рыцаря сделалась самоуверенной. – Уилл, веди нас туда, я сам хочу увидеть этих мертвецов. Ну что ж, делать нечего. Приказ отдан, надо повиноваться. Уилл направился первым, его косматая невысокая лошадка внимательно выбирала путь через подлесок. Позапрошлой ночью выпал легкий снежок, и камни, корни и ямки прятались под его поверхностью, поджидая неосторожного и беспечного. Сир Уэймар Ройс следовал за ним, рослый вороной жеребец нетерпеливо фыркал. Боевой конь не годился для разведки, но попробуй это сказать его лордству. Гаред замыкал линию. Старый оруженосец что-то бурчал под нос. Сумерки сгущались. Неласковое небо сперва приняло глубокий пурпурный оттенок, потом цвет старого синяка и, наконец, почернело. Начали выступать звезды. Над деревьями объявился и полумесяц. Уилл обрадовался свету. – Можно бы и прибавить шагу, – заметил Ройс, когда луна поднялась повыше. – Я не уверен, – отвечал Уилл. Страх заставил его забыть про вежливость. – Быть может, милорд хочет возглавить нас? Сир Уэймар Ройс не потрудился ответить. Где-то вдалеке в лесу завыл волк. Уилл завел свою лошадь под ствол, древний и корявый, и спешился. – Почему ты остановился? – спросил сир Уэймар. – Остаток пути лучше пройти пешком, милорд. Место как раз за гребнем. Вглядываясь вдаль, Ройс помедлил, на мгновение остановившись в явной задумчивости. Холодный ветер прошелестел в деревьях, толстый меховой плащ рыцаря словно бы сам собой шевельнулся сзади. – Здесь что-то неладно, – пробормотал Гаред. Молодой рыцарь посмотрел на него с презрительной улыбкой: – В самом деле? – Неужели вы не ощущаете сами? – спросил Гаред. – Прислушайтесь к тьме. Уилл чувствовал это. За все четыре года, проведенных в Ночном Дозоре, ему никогда не приводилось так пугаться. Что это такое? – Дует ветер. Деревья шелестят. Волк воет. Какой звук лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? – Не дождавшись ответа, Ройс изящно выскользнул из седла. Он надежно привязал скакуна к низкому суку, чуть в стороне от остальных, и извлек из ножен длинный меч. На рукоятке блеснули самоцветы, лунный свет пробежал по сверкающей стали. Великолепное оружие, выкованное в замке, и не столь уж давно, если как следует приглядеться. Только вот едва ли им замахивались в гневе, решил Уилл. – Здесь всюду деревья, – предостерег Уилл. – Меч помешает вам, милорд. Лучше возьмите нож. – Если мне потребуются наставления, я попрошу их, – сказал молодой лорд. – Гаред, оставайся здесь. Охраняй коней. Гаред спешился. – Нам нужен огонь. Я разведу костер. – Какой же ты дурак, старик! Если по этому лесу бродят враги, значит, в огне мы нуждаемся в самую последнюю очередь. – Бывает, что врагов огонь удерживает в стороне, – проговорил Гаред. – Его боятся медведи и лютоволки… да и другие… Рот сира Уэймара сложился в прямую линию: – Никакого огня! Капюшон Гареда прикрыл лицо, но, поворачиваясь к рыцарю, Уилл заметил в глазах старика жесткий блеск. На миг он испугался, что Гаред достанет свой меч… короткая уродливая штуковина, рукоятка изъедена по́том, лезвие притуплено долгим употреблением… Уилл не дал бы железного шиллинга за жизнь лорденыша, если бы Гаред извлек свой клинок из ножен. Наконец Гаред поглядел вниз. – Никакого огня, – пробормотал он едва слышным голосом. Ройс принял это за подтверждение и отвернулся. – Ступай, – сказал он Уиллу. Уилл направился в чащу, потом вверх по склону к высокому гребню, где он обнаружил удобное место под страж-деревом. Тонкая корочка снега едва прикрывала грязь и влагу, ноги скользили – мешали камни и скрытые корни, – однако, поднимаясь, Уилл не произвел ни звука. За его спиной негромко позвякивал кольчугой лорденок, шелестели листья, раздавались негромкие ругательства, когда загребущие ветви цеплялись за длинный меч и за великолепный соболий плащ. Огромное страж-дерево находилось прямо на гребне; как помнил Уилл, нижние ветви его поднимались от земли почти на фут. Уилл скользнул под дерево, лег на живот в снег и грязь, поглядел на пустую поляну внизу, и сердце его провалилось в пятки. Мгновение он не смел дохнуть. Луна освещала поляну, кострище, занесенный снегом навес, огромную скалу, маленький узкий полузамерзший ручеек. Все это осталось неизменным – как и несколько часов назад. Но людей не было, все тела исчезли. – Ах, боги! – услышал он позади себя голос. Меч рубанул по ветке, и сир Уэймар Ройс поднялся на гребень. Он остановился возле страж-дерева с мечом в руках, ветер раздувал плащ, все вокруг могли видеть благородный силуэт на фоне звездного неба. – Немедленно вниз! – настоятельно шепнул Уилл. – Здесь что-то не так. Ройс не шевельнулся. Он поглядел на пустую прогалину и расхохотался: – Выходит, твои мертвецы куда-то перебрались. Голос Уилла предал его. Он искал слова и не находил их. Немыслимо! Глаза его метались взад и вперед по покинутому стану и остановились на топоре. Огромный боевой топор с двумя лезвиями все еще лежал на прежнем месте. Ценное оружие… – На ноги, Уилл, – приказал сир Уэймар. – Здесь никого нет. Я не хочу, чтобы ты прятался под кустом. Уилл нерешительно поднял голову. Сир Уэймар глядел на него с открытым неодобрением. – Я не намереваюсь вернуться в Черный замок с признанием о неудаче моей первой вылазки. Мы найдем этих людей. – Он огляделся. – Лезь на дерево. И быстро. Ищи огонь. Уилл молча отвернулся, спорить было бесполезно. Ветер менялся. Теперь порывы продували насквозь. Уилл подошел к дереву, высоко поднимавшему свои серо-зеленые ветви, и полез вверх. Скоро руки его запачкались смолой, и он почти потерялся среди иголок. Страх наполнил нутро Уилла комом непереваренной пищи. Прочитав молитву безымянным богам леса, он извлек свой кинжал из ножен и зажал в зубах, чтобы можно было держаться за дерево обеими руками. Вкус холодного железа во рту почему-то всегда успокаивал его. Лорденыш внизу вдруг воскликнул: – Кто идет? Уилл услышал неуверенность в его голосе и замер, прислушиваясь и наблюдая. Лес дал ответ: шелестели листья, в ледяном ложе бежал ручей, вдалеке кричала снежная сова. Иные не издают звуков. Уилл заметил движение уголком глаза. Бледные силуэты появились в лесу. Повернув голову, он увидел белую тень, скользнувшую во тьме. Тень исчезла. Ветки легко шевелились под ветром, скребли друг друга деревянными пальцами. Уилл открыл рот, чтобы выкрикнуть предупреждение, но слова как будто замерзли в его горле. Возможно, он ошибся, и это всего лишь птица или отражение, брошенное на снег прихотью лунного света. В конце концов, что он видел? – Уилл, где ты? – поднял голову вверх сир Уэймар. – Ты заметил что-нибудь? – Зажав в руке меч, рыцарь медленно, с внезапным напряжением повернулся на месте. Значит, и он ощутил их. Ощутил, но не увидел. – Отвечай мне! Почему так холодно? Было действительно холодно. Ежась, Уилл плотнее прижался к стволу, припав лицом к грубой коре. Сладко пахло смолой, прилипшей к щеке. Из тьмы леса родилась тень и остановилась перед Ройсом. Высокая, тощая и твердая, как старые кости, и вместе с тем бледная, как молоко. Панцирь ее словно менял цвет при каждом движении. Он то становился белым, как свежевыпавший снег, то покрывался угольной тенью, то отливал серой зеленью деревьев. С каждым шагом новый узор пробегал по броне, словно лунный свет по воде. Уилл услышал, как дыхание с долгим шипением вырвалось из груди сира Уэймара Ройса. – Стой! – выкрикнул лорденыш, дав петуха как мальчишка. Забросив длинный соболий плащ за плечи, он освободил обе руки для боя и взял меч. Ветер утих, но сделалось еще холоднее. Иной скользил вперед, бесшумно ступая; в руке существо держало длинный меч. Таких клинков Уилл никогда не видел. Ни один известный людям металл не мог бы пойти на это лезвие. Играя в лунном свете, меч казался прозрачной полоской тонкого хрусталя и почти исчезал, поворачиваясь плоскостью. Он горел призрачным голубым пламенем, и чутье поведало Уиллу, что более острого клинка ему еще не встречалось. – Ну что ж, попляшем и согреемся, – пробормотал сир Уэймар и занес свой меч над головой. Руки его дрожали от тяжести оружия или, может быть, от холода. И все же в тот момент Уилл увидел в нем не прежнего мальчика, но мужа из Ночного Дозора. Иной остановился, и Уилл заметил глаза существа: глубокая и густая нечеловеческая синева сверкала как лед. Они были обращены к длинному мечу, занесенному над головой, и лунный свет леденил металл. На миг Уилл потерял надежду. Они безмолвно возникали из теней двойниками первого. Их было трое… четверо… пятеро… Сир Уэймар, должно быть, ощущал холод, который принесли Иные, но не видел их, даже не слышал. Уиллу следовало бы крикнуть. Но, выполняя свой долг, он лишь навлек бы на себя несомненную смерть. Трепеща, Уилл только теснее обнял дерево, сохраняя молчание. Бледный меч холодом пронзил воздух. Сир Уэймар встретил удар сталью. Клинки соприкоснулись не со звоном металла о металл: в воздухе проплыл тонкий стон животного, получившего смертельную рану. Ройс отразил и второй удар, и третий, а затем отступил на шаг. Последовал еще поток ударов, и он снова отступил. Позади него, справа, слева, вокруг стояли терпеливые, безликие и безмолвные наблюдатели, текучие узоры на хрупкой броне делали их в лесу почти невидимыми. И все же они не пытались вмешаться. Вновь и вновь встречались мечи. Уиллу захотелось зажать уши, только бы не слышать этот странный болезненный визг. Сир Уэймар теперь пыхтел от натуги, дыхание паром струилось в лунном свете. Его клинок побелел от мороза. Иной же плясал вокруг с бледным голубым пламенем в руках. А потом удар Ройса чуть запоздал. Бледный меч прорезал его кольчугу на боку. Молодой лорд вскрикнул от боли. Кровь хлынула между колец. Она задымилась на холоде, красные как огонь капли падали на снег. Пальцы сира Уэймара зажали бок, на кротовой перчатке выступила кровь. Иной что-то сказал: языка Уилл не знал, голос чужака трещал словно лед на зимнем озере, но в словах слышалась насмешка. К сиру Уэймару вновь вернулась ярость. – За короля Роберта! – закричал он и отчаянно бросился вперед, обеими руками занес покрытый изморозью меч и рубанул им сбоку, вложив в удар вес всего тела. Иной ответил небрежным ленивым движением. Клинки соприкоснулись, и сталь разбилась. С визгом, отозвавшимся в ночном лесу, длинный меч рассыпался на сотню хрупких иголок, дождем разлетевшихся вокруг. Ройс упал на колени, с криком прижимая руку к глазам. Кровь проступала между его пальцев. Безмолвные наблюдатели разом шагнули вперед, словно получив какой-то сигнал. Мечи поднимались и падали в смертельном безмолвии. Началась хладнокровная бойня. Бледные клинки прорезали кольчугу, словно какой-то шелк. Уилл закрыл глаза. Голоса их и смех, колючий словно сосульки, раздавались где-то под ним. Не скоро он накопил достаточно отваги, чтобы поглядеть вниз, даже когда гребень уже опустел. Едва смея дышать, Уилл еще долго оставался на дереве, и луна медленно ползла по черному небу. Наконец мышцы его окоченели, пальцы онемели от холода, и он стал спускаться. Тело Ройса лежало лицом в снег, одна рука была протянута в сторону, толстый соболий плащ прорезан в дюжине мест. Было видно, насколько он молод. Мальчишка. Уилл нашел остатки меча чуть в стороне: клинок расщепился и изогнулся, напоминая дерево, пораженное ударом молнии. Став на колени, Уилл осторожно огляделся вокруг и подобрал оружие. Расщепленный клинок послужит доказательством его слов. Гаред знает, что все это значит, а если нет, то поймет старый медведь Мормонт или мейстер Эйемон. Ждет ли его еще Гаред с лошадьми? Надо торопиться. Уилл поднялся. Над ним высился сир Уэймар Ройс. Тонкие одежды разодраны, лицо разбито. Осколок торчал из ослепленной левой глазницы. Правый глаз был открыт. Зрачок его горел синим огнем и… видел. Сломанный меч упал из бесчувственных пальцев. Уилл закрыл глаза, чтобы помолиться. Длинные благородные пальцы коснулись его щеки, стиснули горло. Уилл ощутил прикосновение тончайшей выделки кротовой кожи, липкой от крови. Но прикосновение оказалось ледяным. Текст 2: Пролог В городе, который некогда назывался Кабитэла, а ныне — Оллария, цвела сирень. Ее белые и лиловые свечи, как и положено горящим свечам, были обречены. Обречены были и воркующие на крышах голуби, и суетящиеся на улицах люди, и сам этот мир, но неизбежность конца придавала весеннему городу некое горькое очарование. Трудно любить то, что всегда было и всегда будет, зато осознание того, что «это в последний раз», оживляет притупившиеся чувства, и ты замечаешь вещи, которые раньше не замечал, и сердце твое разрывается от любви и боли. Одинокий в последний раз шел улицами Олларии — этот мир становился опасен. Скоро старая, добрая Кэртиана будет вотчиной раттонов, пройдет еще несколько веков, и то, во что превратится некогда вольный и радостный мир, придется уничтожить. Из великого Ожерелья выпадет еще одна бусина — не столь уж и страшная потеря, ведь сама Нить уцелеет. Шедший цветущим городом гость понимал, что беда случится не завтра. То, что для него было «скоро», для смертных означало почти «никогда». Люди, спешащие по своим делам и странным образом не замечающие высокого чужака, успеют долюбить, досуетиться, доненавидеть, равно, как и их дети, внуки и правнуки. И все равно Одинокому было мучительно жаль исполненный жизни город с его каштанами и сиренью, щебечущими скворцами, красными черепичными крышами и булыжными мостовыми. Люди… Одинокий усмехнулся — он ведь тоже БЫЛ человеком. Был, пока не прошел Костры Этерны. Его никто не вынуждал — в пламя Этерны нельзя ни столкнуть, ни заманить. Он сам выбрал свою судьбу, согласившись умереть, чтоб воскреснуть Стражем Заката, вечным воином и странником, давшим клятву хранить Ожерелье. Одинокий не знал, как и где начался его путь, — Нить длинна, а его память сгорела в вихре лилового огня, огня цвета увядающей сирени. Нет, он ни в чем не раскаивался и ни о чем не жалел, — бесконечный бой, в котором не может быть победы, стал его прошлым, настоящим и будущим, не оставив места для сомнений и тоски, но в некоторых мирах страннику хотелось задержаться. Одинокий полагал, что эти миры чем-то напоминали его прежнюю родину, но чем — не знал и не мог знать. Все, что случилось до того, как будущий Страж Заката шагнул в лиловый костер и адская боль разорвала в клочья сознание, исчезло. Это было разумно — прошлое имеет над нами слишком большую власть. Те, кто держит на плечах небо, должны быть свободны от былых привязанностей и долгов, но весенняя Кэртиана пьянила и печалила. Может, все дело было в цветущих каштанах и сирени, а может, в чужих улыбках или в стремительных острокрылых ласточках… Одинокий протянул руку, и могучий каштан медленно склонил ветви навстречу чужаку. Сильные пальцы легко коснулись цветочной грозди, и путник чему-то улыбнулся, по-кошачьи сощурившись. Он мог обернуться стариком, юношей, женщиной, леопардом, драконом, наконец, но предпочитал оставаться самим собой. Внешность — единственное, что оставил ему лиловый огонь. Страж Заката надеялся, что кто-то когда-то любил его именно таким. Или ненавидел. Одинокий не сомневался, что всегда был воином, но все остальное… Было ли ему что терять? Хотелось верить, что было. Иногда он пытался придумать себе человеческое прошлое, счастье, от которого отказался, последовав за позвавшей его адой, но выдумки или таяли, как облака, или жгли, как раскаленное железо. Вечный воин, он сочинял сказки о великой любви и преданной дружбе, а они не сочинялись. Он видел себя умирающим от удара в спину, ожидающим пыток и казни, скитающимся в чужих краях, идущим сквозь чужую зависть, злобу, презрение, но не счастливым. Отчего-то казалось, что в его жизни ненависти было больше, чем любви, а боли больше, чем радости, и все равно Одинокий предпочел бы помнить все. Колокольный перезвон вернул странника на землю Кэртианы. Смертные всегда и всюду просят небожителей о милости, не зная, что боги погибли, а те, кто принял их ношу, не имеют ни сил, ни возможности снисходить к человеческим просьбам. Чуждое не оставляет попыток поглотить Ожерелье, а противостоят растущему напору лишь Одинокие. Их дело — сражаться, и, пока они бьются, смертным отвечают раттоны, будь они трижды прокляты! Одинокий отпустил ветку и двинулся дальше, смешавшись с изливающимся из храма людским потоком. Его не замечали, не «не видели», а именно не замечали, зато он замечал все, — ведь он видел Кэртиану в последний раз, Кэртиану, которая тысячи лет была его «поляной в лесу», местом, к которому тянулось его сердце. Залечив раны и набравшись сил, он прежде, чем вернуться в бой, проходил через этот мир, запоминая женский смех и детские крики. Одинокий не создавал Кэртиану и не был ею создан, но ему хотелось любить, и он полюбил этот мир и, защищая Ожерелье, защищал в первую очередь его. Кэртиана жила и дышала за его спиной, так было, но так больше не будет. Он не вправе позволить раттонам отыскать свои следы — Осень слишком драгоценна, чтобы рисковать ею. Осень дороже Кэртианы, а Ожерелье дороже одной из бусин. Когда Этерна была цела, они сражались за каждый из миров Ожерелья. Теперешних сил едва хватает, чтобы сдерживать Чуждое на Новом Рубеже. Раньше Одинокие вмешивались в дела смертных, называвших их кто богами, кто демонами, теперь в прошлом и это. В прошлом все, кроме боя. Когда падет последний защитник, придет конец и Ожерелью, только раттонам этого не понять. Они вообще мало что понимают, эти возомнившие себя богами ничтожества. Играя в свои игры, они подгрызают Нить, невольно помогая тому или тем, кто рвется к ней снаружи. Теперь они подняли голову и в Кэртиане. Одинокий медленно шел по залитым солнцем улицам, наслаждаясь тем, что ступает по твердой земле, дышит полной грудью, видит цветы и улыбки. Грязь, старость, несправедливость никуда не исчезли, но он старался не думать о них, так же как и о раттонах. Твари еще не вошли в полную силу, Кэртиана не знает, что смертельно больна, и в этом ее счастье. Если б он мог задержаться! Но каждый должен делать то, что за него не сделает никто. Место Одинокого — его бой на Рубеже. Внутренние Миры выживают или погибают сами и по своей вине. Смертные наделены волей и разумом, они могут и должны дать отпор раттонам, а не идти у них на поводу, но как им это объяснишь?! Он несколько раз пробовал говорить с людьми — его не понимали. Улица заканчивалась у старинной стены, к которой лепились торговые ряды. Оллария поглотила старую Кабитэлу. Новое или поглощает старое, или убивает. Когда-то здесь расстилались ржаные поля, которые топтали воины Франциска Оллара, бастарда, пожелавшего стать великим королем и ставшего им. Губы Одинокого скривились в усмешке. Откуда у него привычка улыбаться и даже смеяться, когда на сердце особенно мерзко, Страж Заката не знал. Возможно, это тень его старой жизни. Магия Этерны была сильна, но даже она не уничтожила всего. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но его притягивали или, наоборот, отталкивали некоторые звуки, запахи, лица. Вот и тот рыцарь, которому он сказал, что совесть выше и чести, и закона, почему он заговорил именно с ним? Сколько лет прошло! Почему ему до сих пор больно вспоминать, чем все закончилось? Кэртианца давным-давно нет на свете, а Одинокий все ищет для него слова и доводы, ищет и не находит. И все равно случившееся тогда отобрало у раттонов несколько веков. Для Ожерелья — миг, для Кэртианы — жизнь восьми или десяти поколений. Жаль только, что тот, кто подарил своему миру четыреста лет свободы, не дождался ни благодарности, ни понимания… Толпившиеся на улице горожане расступились, пропуская красивого всадника на породистой вороной кобыле, и Одинокий невольно залюбовался. Человек был счастлив, как может быть счастлив лишь… человек, живущий единым, сверкающим мигом. Он любил и был любим — Одинокий понял это сразу. Захваченный волной чужой радости, странник не сразу почуял приглушенную ненависть. За влюбленным следили. Кто? Соперник? Муж? Или эта злоба не имеет ничего общего с чужим счастьем? Похоже на то, уж больно она холодна и расчетлива. Страж Заката пожал плечами, мысленно пожелав неведомому всаднику избежать удара в спину, и сразу же забыл и о нем, и о его враге. Этот вечер принадлежал ему, и он хотел провести его так, словно сам был плотью от плоти этого мира. Ожерелье, Рубеж, бой без надежды и без конца — все это нет, не исчезло, но словно бы отодвинулось. Одинокий чувствовал себя свободным и смертным, он даже позволил себе зайти в таверну и сесть в углу, куда немедленно принесли кувшин с вином, после чего никто и не подумал взглянуть в сторону странного посетителя. Люди приходили и уходили, а Одинокий смотрел на них — пьющих, смеющихся, поющих… Откуда-то вылезла маленькая пятнистая кошка, почти котенок, и остановилась, нерешительно глядя на гостя. Кошка — не человек, ей глаза не отведешь. Эти маленькие вольные твари не только чуют всех, владеющих магией, но и сами ей сопричастны, потому-то раттоны их и ненавидят. И ненависть эта взаимна. Если кошек начинают гнать, проклинать, называть нечистыми, предавшимися злу тварями, ищи поблизости раттонов. Одинокий поднял бровь, и кошка, расценив это как приглашение, прыгнула ему на колени. В зверьке билась магическая искра, маленькая и слабая, но отчетливая. Кошки понимают, что ждет Кэртиану. Кошки, но не люди. Воин успел застать создателей этого мира. Их было четверо, и они откликнулись на призыв Этерны и ушли на Рубеж, поручив Кэртиану своим избранникам из числа смертных. Человеческой памяти хватило на три тысячи лет. Не так уж и мало, если вспомнить, что люди редко живут дольше семидесяти… Правнукам нынешних гуляк придется туго — раттоны убивают чужую радость, может быть, потому, что сами на нее не способны. Зависть, злоба, страх — это да, это по ним, но радости этим существам не отпущено. Только злорадство. Возможно, их стоит пожалеть, но Одинокий, если б мог, перебил их всех. Если б мог… Здешним обитателям и не снилась мощь, которой он обладал. Страж Заката мог уничтожить Кэртиану и боялся, что испить эту чашу доведется именно ему. В его власти уничтожить, но не спасти. Как легко сжечь зачумленный город и этим остановить заразу, но кто возьмется одолеть беду, выловив всех чумных крыс? А раттоны — чумные крысы Ожерелья, их становится все больше, а Одиноких все меньше! Кошка, почуяв его ярость, вздрогнула и прижала уши. Она знала, как сражаться с крысами, если б ее сородичи были покрупнее и посильнее, если б их удалось объединить и натравить на этих, с позволения сказать, новых владык, но увы! Страж Заката взял кубок и поднес к кошачьей морде. Зверушка брезгливо сморщила нос и отодвинулась. Пробовать вино она не собиралась, и Одинокий выпил сам. В память первых богов Кэртианы! Они были готовы умереть на Рубеже, а смерть настигла их в Этерне, казавшейся самым безопасным местом Ожерелья. Тогда погибли многие и вместе с ними погибла надежда. Одинокий залпом допил вино, словно ему, теперешнему, это могло помочь. Вечер продолжался. Играла музыка, танцевала черноволосая девушка в алой, низко вырезанной блузке, а он видел шар ревущего пламени, чудовищную звезду, родившуюся из гибели Этерны. Нет, это было потом, конь его судьбы свернул с общей дороги раньше. …Они стояли под серебристым мертвым небом без солнца и птиц, а Пепельное море лениво переливало у их ног тяжелые, медленные волны. Казалось, Чуждое устало рваться вперед, его напор ослабел. Уходившие в Этерну шутили, что отдыхать можно и на Рубеже, и они готовы остаться. Потом камни на мечах вспыхнули лиловыми звездами, предупреждая о том, что Чуждое шевельнулось. Приближался бой — один из множества, — ничего выдающегося, сколько таких было, и сколько еще будет. Горизонт набухал похожими на гарадских итаров тучами, предвещая бурю, которую предстояло остановить. Шторм надвигался медленно и неотвратимо, нападавшие и обороняющие в тысячный раз готовились помериться силами, заранее зная, что они равны. Стратег остающихся нехорошо улыбнулся, приветствуя подползавшего врага, небо стало ниже, море с шумом отступало, обнажая скалистое дно. Ни водорослей, ни раковин, ни бьющейся на мели рыбы. Только серый, отливающий сталью камень… — Нам пора, — Одинокий забыл, кто произнес эти слова, — это не наш бой. Бой и вправду был не их. Они сделали свое дело и могли возвращаться в Этерну, но он избрал другую дорогу. Дворец Архонта с его вечными празднествами в честь вернувшихся с Рубежа и уходящих на Рубеж был хорош, но Одинокий не любил пиров, можно даже сказать, ненавидел. Видимо, это тоже выползло из его убитого прошлого. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но каждая поднятая в высоких чертогах чаша отзывалась в сердце звериной тоской. Одинокий любил своих товарищей, любовался адами, верил Архонту и Стратегам, но их буйное веселье было не по нему. Похоже, он стал Одиноким до того, как это слово сорвалось с губ последней уцелевшей ады. Как бы то ни было, ненависть к пирам его и спасла. Убегая от ненавистной радости, он забрел сюда, в Кэртиану, где его и застиг зов. Рубеж просил помощи, и было некогда думать, что там происходит. Он бросился назад… Одинокий с силой сжал пустой кубок, вспоминая непосильную тяжесть, словно ему, как герою легенды, и впрямь пришлось взвалить на плечи небесный свод. Рядом кто-то упал, груз стал еще неподъемней, он стиснул зубы, заставляя себя держаться. Сгоревшие Миры, по которым пролегал Рубеж, были мертвы, их можно было оставить без особого риска, но, единожды отступив, отступишь снова, и он держался, они все держались… Чуждое наконец схлынуло, как всегда, рассыпавшись стаей странных, смертных созданий, на сей раз похожих на летучих медуз. Полупрозрачная мерзость сама бросалась на мечи, словно желая побыстрее со всем покончить. Одинокому показалось, что бой длился дольше, чем обычно, но, возможно, он просто устал. — В Этерне решили, что мы испугались собственной тени? — недовольно бросил бившийся рядом Стратег, разрубая слизистый гриб. — Я не был там. — Одинокий отшвырнул студенистое полушарие. — Не понимаю. Нас не услышали? Или что-то стряслось в самой Этерне? Тогда это показалось бредом. Что могло стрястись в месте, исполненном великой Силы, покорной Архонту и его сподвижникам? Нет, это невиданная доселе схватка приглушила Зов, и он не достиг цели. — Как бы то ни было, я должен говорить с Архонтом, — бросил Стратег, оглядывая из-под руки серебристый горизонт, — и я буду говорить с ним. Поговорить с Архонтом Стратегу не удалось — Этерны больше не существовало. Что именно произошло, уцелевшие так никогда и не узнали. Был ли это заговор, неосторожность, несчастливая случайность или же сработал доселе неведомый закон мироздания, но произошло то, что произошло. Те, кого в час беды не оказалось в Этерне, собрались на Рубеже. Их было больше, чем они боялись, и меньше, чем надеялись. Выжившие могли держать Рубеж, но не создавать миры и не одаривать избранных бессмертием и силой. Одинокий навеки запомнил глаза Стратега — исполненные боли и тревоги глаза воина, осознавшего, что ему не дождаться ни помощи, ни приказа, что все смотрят на него и отныне от него зависит исход войны… Стратег стал Архонтом, а все они — Одинокими, не загадывавшими дальше грядущей схватки. Рано или поздно Чуждое прорвет оборону и набросится на внутренние миры, впрочем, в последнее время Одинокий стал опасаться, что раттоны погубят Ожерелье прежде, чем падет Рубеж. …Крик был неожиданным и страшным. Это не было зовом в прямом смысле этого слова, но Одинокий вскочил, сбросив на пол раздосадованную кошку. Неподалеку шел неравный бой — кто-то в одиночку отбивался от множества убийц. Страж Заката чувствовал их ярость, удивление и, наконец, страх. Тот, на кого напали, был обречен, но он дрался и как дрался! Одинокий словно бы вживую увидел большую, тускло освещенную комнату, опрокинутую, разбитую мебель, мечущиеся силуэты, чьи-то глаза, белые от ярости… Странно, он ведь отгородился от чужих мыслей и чувств, и отгородился надежно, в чем же дело? Раттоны? Нет, тут они ни при чем. Страж Заката, по-прежнему никем не примеченный, выбежал на улицу. Город спал или делал вид, что спит, было тихо, но Одинокий не сомневался — рядом убивают. Более того, он знал, кого именно — всадника, встреченного им на площади. Те, кто за ним следил, времени зря не теряли. Где-то завыла собака, хлопнула дверь, в окне напротив задули свечу. Воин пожал плечами и быстро пошел по пустынному переулку. Зачем ему это? Люди вечно враждуют, а если не могут справиться с противником в открытом бою, бьют в спину. Кэртиана не исключение, скоро здесь и вовсе начнется война всех со всеми. Война, в которой не будет победителей, кроме раттонов. Переулок влился в тихую улицу, застроенную двухэтажными домами; в одном из них погибал человек, чья неистовая радость разбудила в Одиноком то, что, казалось, ушло навсегда. Между ним и смертным возникла ниточка, которая и привела чужака к изящному особняку, в котором шел бой. Шел, хотя должен был уже закончиться. Жалобно зазвенело разбитое окно, сквозь которое пролетел какой-то обломок, раздался крик, и ответом ему был наглухо захлопнувшийся ставень в доме напротив. Эта «хата» явно была «с краю». Снова звон, злобный вопль, глухие удары и возня внутри и мертвая тишина снаружи. Как похоже на людей… Остатки здравого смысла шептали, уговаривали, требовали оставить все, как есть. Одинокие не вмешиваются в дела смертных, Кэртиана захвачена раттонами, он не должен оставлять следов… Он их и не оставит! Зачем тратить Силу, ведь он может драться, как человек! Он это умеет, всегда умел, и будь трижды прокляты все раттоны всех миров и все запреты! Одинокий выхватил меч и пинком вышиб жалобно вскрикнувшую дверь. Текст 3: Пролог «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой...","output":"Тексты, представленные для сравнения, предположительно представляют собой прологи к трем различным фантастическим произведениям.

Reflection and absorption of radio waves: Radio waves are typically reflected by materials that conduct electricity well, such as metals. The quality of reflection is determined by the conductivity of the material, the surface roughness, and the angle of incidence. Smooth metal surfaces are excellent reflectors due to their high conductivity and ability to re-radiate the radio waves coherently. Materials like water and the earth can absorb radio waves, converting their energy into heat. Dielectric materials such as glass or plastic can be transparent or partially reflective depending on their composition and frequency of the waves. 2. Sky wave effect: Sky waves, also known as ionospheric propagation, occur when radio waves are refracted by the ionosphere, enabling long-distance communication. The best time to utilize sky wave propagation is at night when the ionosphere is more stable and less absorptive. Frequencies between about 3 MHz and 30 MHz are most effectively reflected by the ionosphere. Lower frequencies can penetrate the ionosphere, and higher frequencies may pass through it. 3. Faraday cage and radio waves: A Faraday cage can reflect and absorb radio waves. It functions by distributing the electromagnetic fields around its exterior, canceling them out inside the enclosure. It does not allow external static electric fields to pass through. If the Faraday cage is made of a material with high conductivity, it will reflect more radio waves, while some absorption occurs due to resistive losses in the material. 4. Grounded vs non-grounded Faraday cage: A grounded Faraday cage is connected to the earth, which provides a sink for any charges or electromagnetic fields interacting with the cage. Grounding can enhance the shielding effect for low-frequency fields, as it provides a direct path for the induced currents to flow to the ground. A non-grounded Faraday cage still provides shielding by reflecting and absorbing radio waves, but it might allow electric fields from very low frequency to float with respect to the ground potential. 5. Wave penetration depending on frequency: In general, lower frequency radio waves (longer wavelengths) can penetrate through non-conductive materials easier than higher frequency waves. As frequency increases, the material\'s absorption effect typically increases, leading to lesser penetration. For instance, buildings, foliage, and terrain are more transparent to radio waves in the AM band than in the FM or microwave bands. 6. Faraday cage cell size: The size of the openings in a Faraday cage should be much smaller than the wavelength of the radio waves to be blocked. For example, if the cage is meant to shield against a frequency of 1 GHz (with a wavelength of approximately 30 cm), the holes should be less than 1/20th of the wavelength, or about 1.5 cm. 7. Thickness of the Faraday grid conductor: The thickness of the conductive material in a Faraday cage does not need to be substantial to reflect or absorb radio waves, as long as the skin depth of the material at the frequency of interest is much less than the thickness. The skin depth is where the current density is reduced to 1/e (about 37%) of its value at the surface, and for a good conductor, this is typically a small fraction of a millimeter at radio frequencies. 8. Static electric field: A static field is not reflected because reflection is a dynamic phenomenon associated with changing electric fields. A Faraday cage shields against static electric fields not by reflection but by reallocating charges within its conductive surface to negate the field inside. 9. Faraday grid in a reflective antenna: Yes, a Faraday grid can be used as a reflector element in an antenna, such as in a grid parabolic reflector. The optimal distance between the antenna (feed) and the parabolic reflector is based on the focal length of the parabola, and the position should be such that the feed is at the focus to maximize the directivity of the antenna. The diameter of the parabolic reflector is determined by the desired aperture size and should be multiple whole wavelengths of the frequency used to ensure a sufficiently narrow beamwidth and high antenna gain. The general formula for the focused beam parabolic antenna diameter D is given by: [ D = frac{70 lambda}{sqrt{G}} ] where (lambda) is the wavelength and (G) is the gain of the antenna. The precise position and dimensions would require more complex design considerations, including phase patterns and aperture distribution based on the system\'s specific requirements."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artWolverine","output":"Wolverine | Bold Graphic Artwork for Mugs, T-Shirts, Wall Paintings | Fierce Animal Design | Versatile Home & Apparel Decor"},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: А ты можешь Ты: Конечно, я стараюсь помогать в любых вопросах, в рамках моих способностей.

I drove to a nearby national park where the lush greenery and fresh air immediately calmed my senses. On Saturday morning, I laced up my hiking boots and set out on a trail that wound through the forest. Birds were chirping, and the sunlight peeked through the canopy, creating a serene atmosphere.<br/><br/>After a few hours of hiking, I found a small clearing and enjoyed a picnic I had packed earlier. The simplicity of eating outdoors, surrounded by the sounds of nature, felt refreshing. In the afternoon, I reached a lookout point that offered a breathtaking view of the valleys below. It was the perfect spot to sit and reflect on the week’s events.<br/><br/>As evening approached, I set up a campfire and cooked a simple meal, feeling grateful for the peace that the wilderness provided. The night sky was a blanket of stars, and the absence of city lights made the view even more spectacular.<br/><br/>On Sunday, I woke up to the gentle sound of a nearby stream. I spent the morning exploring another trail, taking photographs of the vibrant wildflowers and wildlife I encountered along the way. By midday, I began my journey back home, feeling rejuvenated and ready for the week ahead. It was a weekend well spent, with memories that I’d treasure for a long time.

Вот несколько советов как это сделать: 1. Выберите подходящее время и место, где вы оба будете чувствовать себя комфортно и где вас никто не потревожит. 2. Будьте искренними в своих эмоциях и словах. Говорите от сердца. 3. Лучше всего делать это лично, так вы можете видеть реакцию другого человека и непосредственно реагировать на неё. 4. Если чувствуете смущение или страх, можете сначала попрактиковаться и продумать, что и как вы хотите сказать. 5. Используйте я-высказывания, такие как \\"Я чувствую...\\" или \\"Мне очень важны наши отношения...\\" чтобы не оказать давления на другого человека. 6. Не ожидайте моментального ответа; дайте другому человеку время чтобы обдумать свои эмоции и мысли. 7. Помните, что независимо от ответа, важно уважать чувства друг друга. Пример признания: \\"В последнее время я понял, как много значишь для меня.

Materials that reflect radio waves: - Metals: High electrical conductivity makes metals like aluminum, copper, and silver excellent reflectors of radio waves. Because of the free electrons in a metal, when a radio wave hits the surface, these electrons can move easily to counteract the wave\'s electric field, effectively reflecting the waves back. - Conductive paints and materials: With a mix of metal powders or conductive particles, these materials can also reflect radio waves to various extents. - Specialized engineered surfaces: These can include metal meshes, gridded surfaces, or other structured patterns designed to reflect radio waves. Materials that absorb radio waves: - Water: It has a significant dielectric loss factor, which makes water and materials with high water content good absorbers of radio waves. - Wet soil and vegetation: The water content in these materials contributes to absorption. - Certain plastics and foam materials: Especially if they are embedded with conductive or magnetic elements designed to absorb and dissipate radio wave energy. - Ferrite materials: Often used in electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression because they are able to absorb radio waves due to their high magnetic permeability. The quality of reflection is influenced by: - Conductivity: Higher conductivity materials exhibit better reflection as they have more mobile charges available to counteract the electric field of the incoming wave. - Surface roughness: A smooth surface at the scale of the wavelength of the radio wave will reflect the wave more effectively than a rough surface. - Incidence angle: At certain angles, especially the angle known as the Brewster angle, polarization of the waves can lead to reduced reflection from surfaces. - Frequency of the radio waves: Different materials may reflect or absorb better at different frequencies due to their molecular structure and electromagnetic properties. - Thickness of the material: Especially for absorptive materials, thickness can determine how much attenuation the wave undergoes as it passes through or is reflected by the material. - Impedance matching: Mismatched impedances between the material and free space can lead to either reflection or absorption. In practical applications, such as in the design of anechoic chambers for radio frequency testing or in the stealth technology used in military aircraft and vessels, materials are engineered to absorb specific frequencies of radio waves to minimize reflection and thus radar signature."},{"instruction":"List down all Steps involved in order to cash business process, explain each activity step by step. after explaining each activity, list down all possible interview question for the same.","output":"The cash-to-business process, or cash management process, involves managing a company\'s cash inflow and outflow to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating expenses and to achieve longer-term financial goals.

Напиши программу","output":"Чтобы найти количество 6-значных чисел, содержащих ровно 3 различные цифры, мы должны учесть несколько различных случаев, основываясь на распределении этих цифр: 1. Одна цифра встречается 4 раза, другая — 1 раз, третья — 1 раз (например, 111122). 2. Одна цифра встречается 3 раза, вторая — 2 раза, третья — 1 раз (например, 111223). Мы должны рассмотреть все возможные комбинации этих случаев, а также различные способы распределения цифр по 6-значному числу. Давайте напишем программу на Python, которая будет реализовывать все вышеперечисленные шаги: ```python from itertools import permutations, combinations def count_special_numbers(): count = 0 # Случай, когда одна цифра встречается 4 раза, две другие - по 1 разу # Выбираем 3 уникальные цифры (цифра \'0\' не может быть первой) for combo in combinations(\'123456789\', 1) + combinations(\'0123456789\', 2): # Расставляем 4 одинаковые цифры и 2 уникальных (6 выбора куда поставить уникальные цифры) count += 6 * len(set(permutations(combo[1] * 4 + \'\'.join(combo[2:])))) # Случай, когда одна цифра встречается 3 раза, другая 2 раза, третья 1 раз # Объединяем выбор трёх цифр (первая не может быть \'0\') for combo in combinations(\'123456789\', 1) + combinations(\'0123456789\', 2): for second in combo[1:]: for third in \'0123456789\': if second != third and combo[0] != third: # Расставляем 3 одинаковые цифры, 2 одинаковые и 1 уникальную (30 вариаций расстановки) count += 30 * len(set(permutations(combo[0] * 3 + second * 2 + third))) return count print(count_special_numbers()) ``` Этот скрипт подсчитает количество всех подходящих 6-значных чисел за счёт вычисления всех возможных комбинаций и их перестановок с учётом ограничений по расстановке цифр. Обратите внимание, что я использовал комбинации без \'0\' для первой цифры, чтобы исключить числа, начинающиеся с нуля, и тем самым обеспечить, что мы получаем корректные 6-значные числа. В случае когда \'0\' можно использовать для первой цифры, я использую комбинации всех 10 цифр для второй и третьей цифры. Важно заметить, что этот код может быть оптимизирован по производительности, поскольку он может выполнять некоторые вычисления раз за разом, также могут быть другие эффективные способы подсчёта таких чисел, но задача данной программы — показать принцип подсчёта исходя из комбинаторного подхода."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Общий итог Текст 1: Пролог – Надо бы поворачивать, – встревожился Гаред, как только лес вокруг них начал темнеть. – Одичалые мертвы. – Неужели ты боишься покойников? – вопросил сир Уэймар Ройс с легким намеком на улыбку. Гаред не попался на крючок. За свои пятьдесят лет он успел навидаться, как приходят и уходят эти господа. – Мертвый мертв, – отвечал он. – С ним не о чем говорить. – А они действительно мертвы? – спросил Ройс. – Какие доказательства есть у нас? – Уилл видел их, – отвечал Гаред. – И если он говорит, что они мертвы, мне других доказательств не нужно. Уилл знал, что его рано или поздно вовлекут в разговор, и хотел, чтобы это случилось по возможности позже. – Мать моя говорила мне, что покойник не запоет, – сказал он. – То же самое говорила моя няня, – отозвался Ройс. – Уилл, никогда не верь тому, что слышишь возле женской титьки. Есть вещи, которые можно узнать даже от мертвых. – Голос его слишком громко отдавался в сумрачном лесу. – Нам предстоит долгая дорога, – напомнил Гаред. – Восемь дней, а быть может, и девять. И ночь уже близка. Сир Уэймар Ройс поглядел на небо без всякого интереса. – Ночь каждый день приходит примерно в это же время. Неужели тьма лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? Уилл увидел, как напрягся рот Гареда, как сверкнул едва сдерживаемый гнев в глазах под толстым черным капюшоном плаща. Сорок лет – юность и зрелость – провел Гаред в Ночном Дозоре, и свое прошлое он уважал. Однако здесь крылось нечто большее. Под раненой гордостью старшего Уилл угадывал нервное напряжение, опасно приближающееся к страху. Уилл разделял это нелегкое чувство. На Стене он провел четыре года. И когда в первый раз отправился за нее, то сразу вспомнил все старые россказни и чрево его обратилось в воду. Потом, вспоминая первую вылазку, он смеялся. Сотня походов сделала его ветераном, и бесконечная мрачная чаща, которую южане зовут Зачарованным лесом, более не казалась ему ужасной. Но не сегодня. Сегодняшний вечер сулил иное. В этой тьме таилось нечто, заставлявшее подниматься волосы на его затылке. Девять дней они ехали на север, потом на северо-запад и снова на север, все дальше от Стены, преследуя банду дикарей-налетчиков. Каждый день был хуже предшествовавшего ему. И нынешний стал наихудшим. С севера задувал холодный ветер, деревья шелестели, словно живые. Весь день Уиллу казалось, что за ним следит нечто холодное и непреклонное, совершенно не испытывающее к нему симпатии. Гаред ощущал то же самое. Уилл хотел одного – броситься во всю конскую прыть под защиту Стены, но подобными чувствами не делятся со своим командиром. В особенности с таким командиром. Сир Уэймар Ройс был самым молодым отпрыском древнего рода, одним из многочисленных наследников. Симпатичный юноша лет восемнадцати, сероглазый, изящный и стройный, как клинок. Восседая на спине своего рослого вороного боевого коня, рыцарь возвышался над Уиллом и Гаредом на их невысоких дорожных лошадках. Все на нем: черные кожаные сапоги, черные шерстяные штаны, черные перчатки из кротовых шкурок и тонко выделанная куртка из блестящих черных кольчужных колец, нашитых на стеганые слои черной шерсти и вареной кожи, – говорило о принадлежности к Ночному Дозору. Сир Уэймар присягнул на верность братству менее полугода назад, и никто не мог сказать, что он не был подготовлен для такого занятия. Во всяком случае, если говорить о его гардеробе. Довершал одеяние плащ. Соболиный, толстый, черный и соблазнительно мягкий. – Клянется, что сам убил всех зверьков, вот так вот, – показывал Гаред в казарме за вином. – Свернул им головенки наш могучий воитель. Все дружно хохотали. Трудно повиноваться человеку, которого осмеиваешь за выпивкой, думал Уилл, ежившийся на спине своей лошаденки. Гаред, должно быть, испытывал те же чувства. – Мормонт приказал нам выследить их, и мы это сделали, – проговорил Гаред. – Одичалые мертвы. Более они не причинят хлопот. А нам предстоит тяжелая дорога. Мне не нравится погода. Если пойдет снег, на возвращение домой уйдет две недели, а ведь даже снегопад будет подарком. Вы когда-нибудь видели ледяную бурю, милорд? Лорденыш как будто и не слышал его. Ройс изучал сгущающийся сумрак в этакой полурассеянности-полускуке. Уилл успел достаточно долго проездить с рыцарем и знал – лучше не докучать ему в подобном настроении. – Опиши мне еще раз то, что ты видел, Уилл. Все подробности. Ничего не забудь. Прежде чем поступить в Ночной Дозор, Уилл был охотником, точнее говоря, браконьером. Вольные всадники Маллистеров взяли его с кровью на руках в собственных лесах Маллистеров, над освежеванной тушей одного из оленей, принадлежавших Маллистерам; так что ему осталось или надеть черное, или расстаться с рукой. Никто не умел двигаться по лесу безмолвнее Уилла, и Черные Братья весьма скоро обнаружили этот дар. – Их лагерь располагается в двух милях отсюда, за тем гребнем, возле ручья, – проговорил Уилл. – Я подобрался так близко, как только осмелился. Одичалых – восьмеро, есть и мужчины, и женщины. Я не видел там никаких детей. Они соорудили навес возле скалы. Теперь все засыпал снег, но я не заметил огня, хотя кострище было видно как на ладони. Никто не двигался, а ведь я долго следил за ними. Живому человеку не под силу пролежать так, не шевелясь. – А ты видел кровь? – Нет, – признал Уилл. – А оружие? – Несколько мечей и луков. У одного был топор, тяжелый такой, с двумя лезвиями… жестокое железо. Он лежал на земле возле этого человека, прямо у руки. – А ты заметил положение тел? Уилл пожал плечами: – Один сидел возле скалы. Остальные были на земле, попопадали, что ли. – Или спали, – предположил Ройс. – Упали, – настаивал Уилл. – Женщина влезла наверх железного дерева и пряталась среди ветвей. Дозорная. – Он тонко улыбнулся. – Я старался, чтобы она не увидела меня. Но когда подобрался ближе, то заметил, что и она не шевелится. – И против желания он поежился. – Тебе холодно? – спросил Ройс. – Слегка, – пробормотал Уилл. – Ветер, милорд. Молодой рыцарь повернулся к седому оруженосцу. Побитые морозом листья с шелестом пролетели мимо, и конь Ройса беспокойно шевельнулся. – Итак, какова, по-твоему, была причина смерти этих людей, Гаред? – непринужденно спросил сир Уэймар, поправляя длинный соболиный плащ. – Холод, – отвечал Гаред с железной уверенностью. – Прошлой зимой я видел, как замерзают люди, видел и позапрошлой, когда был еще наполовину мальчишкой. Все говорят о снегах глубиной в сорок футов, о том, как ледяной ветер, воя, налетает с севера, но главным врагом является холод. Он добирается до тебя бесшумнее, чем Уилл, и сперва ты только поеживаешься и стучишь зубами, а потом топаешь ногами и мечтаешь о подогретом вине с пряностями и чудесном жарком очаге. Мороз жжет. Ничто не обжигает, как холод. Но лишь поначалу. А потом он проникает внутрь тела, наполняет тебя, пока у человека не остается сил сопротивляться. Легче просто сесть и уснуть. Говорят, что, замерзая, перед концом не чувствуешь никакой боли. Просто слабеешь и тихонько засыпаешь, все словно блекнет, а потом как будто проваливаешься в море теплого молока, в мир и покой. – Экое красноречие, Гаред, – усмехнулся сир Уэймар. – Никогда не подозревал в тебе подобного дара. – Холод проникал и в меня, молодой лорд. – Гаред откинул назад капюшон, давая сиру Уэймару возможность рассмотреть обрубки, оставшиеся на месте ушей. – Два уха, три пальца на ногах и мизинец на левой руке. Я еще легко отделался. Моего брата тогда нашли замерзшим и улыбающимся. Сир Уэймар пожал плечами: – Надо было одеться потеплее, Гаред. Тот гневно глянул на юного лорда, шрамы на месте ушей, там, где мейстер Эйемон срезал обмороженный хрящ, налились кровью от гнева. – Посмотрим, как согреет тебя одежда, когда придет зима. – Он натянул на голову капюшон и сгорбился на своей лошади, угрюмый и молчаливый. – Если Гаред говорит, что было холодно… – начал Уилл. – А ты был в карауле на прошлой неделе, Уилл? – Да, милорд. – Ни одна неделя не проходила без того, чтобы ему не выпадало с дюжину этих паскудных караулов. Чего, собственно, Ройс хочет от него? – И какой была Стена? – Мокрой, – сказал Уилл хмурясь. Теперь он понял, чего добивается молодой лорд. – Они не могли замерзнуть. Ведь Стена подтаяла. Настоящего холода не было. Ройс кивнул: – Смышленый парень. На этой неделе несколько раз подмораживало, выпадал снег, но холодов, достаточно свирепых, чтобы убить восьмерых взрослых людей, не было. Напоминаю: одетых в меха и кожу, возле укрытия и костра. – Улыбка рыцаря сделалась самоуверенной. – Уилл, веди нас туда, я сам хочу увидеть этих мертвецов. Ну что ж, делать нечего. Приказ отдан, надо повиноваться. Уилл направился первым, его косматая невысокая лошадка внимательно выбирала путь через подлесок. Позапрошлой ночью выпал легкий снежок, и камни, корни и ямки прятались под его поверхностью, поджидая неосторожного и беспечного. Сир Уэймар Ройс следовал за ним, рослый вороной жеребец нетерпеливо фыркал. Боевой конь не годился для разведки, но попробуй это сказать его лордству. Гаред замыкал линию. Старый оруженосец что-то бурчал под нос. Сумерки сгущались. Неласковое небо сперва приняло глубокий пурпурный оттенок, потом цвет старого синяка и, наконец, почернело. Начали выступать звезды. Над деревьями объявился и полумесяц. Уилл обрадовался свету. – Можно бы и прибавить шагу, – заметил Ройс, когда луна поднялась повыше. – Я не уверен, – отвечал Уилл. Страх заставил его забыть про вежливость. – Быть может, милорд хочет возглавить нас? Сир Уэймар Ройс не потрудился ответить. Где-то вдалеке в лесу завыл волк. Уилл завел свою лошадь под ствол, древний и корявый, и спешился. – Почему ты остановился? – спросил сир Уэймар. – Остаток пути лучше пройти пешком, милорд. Место как раз за гребнем. Вглядываясь вдаль, Ройс помедлил, на мгновение остановившись в явной задумчивости. Холодный ветер прошелестел в деревьях, толстый меховой плащ рыцаря словно бы сам собой шевельнулся сзади. – Здесь что-то неладно, – пробормотал Гаред. Молодой рыцарь посмотрел на него с презрительной улыбкой: – В самом деле? – Неужели вы не ощущаете сами? – спросил Гаред. – Прислушайтесь к тьме. Уилл чувствовал это. За все четыре года, проведенных в Ночном Дозоре, ему никогда не приводилось так пугаться. Что это такое? – Дует ветер. Деревья шелестят. Волк воет. Какой звук лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? – Не дождавшись ответа, Ройс изящно выскользнул из седла. Он надежно привязал скакуна к низкому суку, чуть в стороне от остальных, и извлек из ножен длинный меч. На рукоятке блеснули самоцветы, лунный свет пробежал по сверкающей стали. Великолепное оружие, выкованное в замке, и не столь уж давно, если как следует приглядеться. Только вот едва ли им замахивались в гневе, решил Уилл. – Здесь всюду деревья, – предостерег Уилл. – Меч помешает вам, милорд. Лучше возьмите нож. – Если мне потребуются наставления, я попрошу их, – сказал молодой лорд. – Гаред, оставайся здесь. Охраняй коней. Гаред спешился. – Нам нужен огонь. Я разведу костер. – Какой же ты дурак, старик! Если по этому лесу бродят враги, значит, в огне мы нуждаемся в самую последнюю очередь. – Бывает, что врагов огонь удерживает в стороне, – проговорил Гаред. – Его боятся медведи и лютоволки… да и другие… Рот сира Уэймара сложился в прямую линию: – Никакого огня! Капюшон Гареда прикрыл лицо, но, поворачиваясь к рыцарю, Уилл заметил в глазах старика жесткий блеск. На миг он испугался, что Гаред достанет свой меч… короткая уродливая штуковина, рукоятка изъедена по́том, лезвие притуплено долгим употреблением… Уилл не дал бы железного шиллинга за жизнь лорденыша, если бы Гаред извлек свой клинок из ножен. Наконец Гаред поглядел вниз. – Никакого огня, – пробормотал он едва слышным голосом. Ройс принял это за подтверждение и отвернулся. – Ступай, – сказал он Уиллу. Уилл направился в чащу, потом вверх по склону к высокому гребню, где он обнаружил удобное место под страж-деревом. Тонкая корочка снега едва прикрывала грязь и влагу, ноги скользили – мешали камни и скрытые корни, – однако, поднимаясь, Уилл не произвел ни звука. За его спиной негромко позвякивал кольчугой лорденок, шелестели листья, раздавались негромкие ругательства, когда загребущие ветви цеплялись за длинный меч и за великолепный соболий плащ. Огромное страж-дерево находилось прямо на гребне; как помнил Уилл, нижние ветви его поднимались от земли почти на фут. Уилл скользнул под дерево, лег на живот в снег и грязь, поглядел на пустую поляну внизу, и сердце его провалилось в пятки. Мгновение он не смел дохнуть. Луна освещала поляну, кострище, занесенный снегом навес, огромную скалу, маленький узкий полузамерзший ручеек. Все это осталось неизменным – как и несколько часов назад. Но людей не было, все тела исчезли. – Ах, боги! – услышал он позади себя голос. Меч рубанул по ветке, и сир Уэймар Ройс поднялся на гребень. Он остановился возле страж-дерева с мечом в руках, ветер раздувал плащ, все вокруг могли видеть благородный силуэт на фоне звездного неба. – Немедленно вниз! – настоятельно шепнул Уилл. – Здесь что-то не так. Ройс не шевельнулся. Он поглядел на пустую прогалину и расхохотался: – Выходит, твои мертвецы куда-то перебрались. Голос Уилла предал его. Он искал слова и не находил их. Немыслимо! Глаза его метались взад и вперед по покинутому стану и остановились на топоре. Огромный боевой топор с двумя лезвиями все еще лежал на прежнем месте. Ценное оружие… – На ноги, Уилл, – приказал сир Уэймар. – Здесь никого нет. Я не хочу, чтобы ты прятался под кустом. Уилл нерешительно поднял голову. Сир Уэймар глядел на него с открытым неодобрением. – Я не намереваюсь вернуться в Черный замок с признанием о неудаче моей первой вылазки. Мы найдем этих людей. – Он огляделся. – Лезь на дерево. И быстро. Ищи огонь. Уилл молча отвернулся, спорить было бесполезно. Ветер менялся. Теперь порывы продували насквозь. Уилл подошел к дереву, высоко поднимавшему свои серо-зеленые ветви, и полез вверх. Скоро руки его запачкались смолой, и он почти потерялся среди иголок. Страх наполнил нутро Уилла комом непереваренной пищи. Прочитав молитву безымянным богам леса, он извлек свой кинжал из ножен и зажал в зубах, чтобы можно было держаться за дерево обеими руками. Вкус холодного железа во рту почему-то всегда успокаивал его. Лорденыш внизу вдруг воскликнул: – Кто идет? Уилл услышал неуверенность в его голосе и замер, прислушиваясь и наблюдая. Лес дал ответ: шелестели листья, в ледяном ложе бежал ручей, вдалеке кричала снежная сова. Иные не издают звуков. Уилл заметил движение уголком глаза. Бледные силуэты появились в лесу. Повернув голову, он увидел белую тень, скользнувшую во тьме. Тень исчезла. Ветки легко шевелились под ветром, скребли друг друга деревянными пальцами. Уилл открыл рот, чтобы выкрикнуть предупреждение, но слова как будто замерзли в его горле. Возможно, он ошибся, и это всего лишь птица или отражение, брошенное на снег прихотью лунного света. В конце концов, что он видел? – Уилл, где ты? – поднял голову вверх сир Уэймар. – Ты заметил что-нибудь? – Зажав в руке меч, рыцарь медленно, с внезапным напряжением повернулся на месте. Значит, и он ощутил их. Ощутил, но не увидел. – Отвечай мне! Почему так холодно? Было действительно холодно. Ежась, Уилл плотнее прижался к стволу, припав лицом к грубой коре. Сладко пахло смолой, прилипшей к щеке. Из тьмы леса родилась тень и остановилась перед Ройсом. Высокая, тощая и твердая, как старые кости, и вместе с тем бледная, как молоко. Панцирь ее словно менял цвет при каждом движении. Он то становился белым, как свежевыпавший снег, то покрывался угольной тенью, то отливал серой зеленью деревьев. С каждым шагом новый узор пробегал по броне, словно лунный свет по воде. Уилл услышал, как дыхание с долгим шипением вырвалось из груди сира Уэймара Ройса. – Стой! – выкрикнул лорденыш, дав петуха как мальчишка. Забросив длинный соболий плащ за плечи, он освободил обе руки для боя и взял меч. Ветер утих, но сделалось еще холоднее. Иной скользил вперед, бесшумно ступая; в руке существо держало длинный меч. Таких клинков Уилл никогда не видел. Ни один известный людям металл не мог бы пойти на это лезвие. Играя в лунном свете, меч казался прозрачной полоской тонкого хрусталя и почти исчезал, поворачиваясь плоскостью. Он горел призрачным голубым пламенем, и чутье поведало Уиллу, что более острого клинка ему еще не встречалось. – Ну что ж, попляшем и согреемся, – пробормотал сир Уэймар и занес свой меч над головой. Руки его дрожали от тяжести оружия или, может быть, от холода. И все же в тот момент Уилл увидел в нем не прежнего мальчика, но мужа из Ночного Дозора. Иной остановился, и Уилл заметил глаза существа: глубокая и густая нечеловеческая синева сверкала как лед. Они были обращены к длинному мечу, занесенному над головой, и лунный свет леденил металл. На миг Уилл потерял надежду. Они безмолвно возникали из теней двойниками первого. Их было трое… четверо… пятеро… Сир Уэймар, должно быть, ощущал холод, который принесли Иные, но не видел их, даже не слышал. Уиллу следовало бы крикнуть. Но, выполняя свой долг, он лишь навлек бы на себя несомненную смерть. Трепеща, Уилл только теснее обнял дерево, сохраняя молчание. Бледный меч холодом пронзил воздух. Сир Уэймар встретил удар сталью. Клинки соприкоснулись не со звоном металла о металл: в воздухе проплыл тонкий стон животного, получившего смертельную рану. Ройс отразил и второй удар, и третий, а затем отступил на шаг. Последовал еще поток ударов, и он снова отступил. Позади него, справа, слева, вокруг стояли терпеливые, безликие и безмолвные наблюдатели, текучие узоры на хрупкой броне делали их в лесу почти невидимыми. И все же они не пытались вмешаться. Вновь и вновь встречались мечи. Уиллу захотелось зажать уши, только бы не слышать этот странный болезненный визг. Сир Уэймар теперь пыхтел от натуги, дыхание паром струилось в лунном свете. Его клинок побелел от мороза. Иной же плясал вокруг с бледным голубым пламенем в руках. А потом удар Ройса чуть запоздал. Бледный меч прорезал его кольчугу на боку. Молодой лорд вскрикнул от боли. Кровь хлынула между колец. Она задымилась на холоде, красные как огонь капли падали на снег. Пальцы сира Уэймара зажали бок, на кротовой перчатке выступила кровь. Иной что-то сказал: языка Уилл не знал, голос чужака трещал словно лед на зимнем озере, но в словах слышалась насмешка. К сиру Уэймару вновь вернулась ярость. – За короля Роберта! – закричал он и отчаянно бросился вперед, обеими руками занес покрытый изморозью меч и рубанул им сбоку, вложив в удар вес всего тела. Иной ответил небрежным ленивым движением. Клинки соприкоснулись, и сталь разбилась. С визгом, отозвавшимся в ночном лесу, длинный меч рассыпался на сотню хрупких иголок, дождем разлетевшихся вокруг. Ройс упал на колени, с криком прижимая руку к глазам. Кровь проступала между его пальцев. Безмолвные наблюдатели разом шагнули вперед, словно получив какой-то сигнал. Мечи поднимались и падали в смертельном безмолвии. Началась хладнокровная бойня. Бледные клинки прорезали кольчугу, словно какой-то шелк. Уилл закрыл глаза. Голоса их и смех, колючий словно сосульки, раздавались где-то под ним. Не скоро он накопил достаточно отваги, чтобы поглядеть вниз, даже когда гребень уже опустел. Едва смея дышать, Уилл еще долго оставался на дереве, и луна медленно ползла по черному небу. Наконец мышцы его окоченели, пальцы онемели от холода, и он стал спускаться. Тело Ройса лежало лицом в снег, одна рука была протянута в сторону, толстый соболий плащ прорезан в дюжине мест. Было видно, насколько он молод. Мальчишка. Уилл нашел остатки меча чуть в стороне: клинок расщепился и изогнулся, напоминая дерево, пораженное ударом молнии. Став на колени, Уилл осторожно огляделся вокруг и подобрал оружие. Расщепленный клинок послужит доказательством его слов. Гаред знает, что все это значит, а если нет, то поймет старый медведь Мормонт или мейстер Эйемон. Ждет ли его еще Гаред с лошадьми? Надо торопиться. Уилл поднялся. Над ним высился сир Уэймар Ройс. Тонкие одежды разодраны, лицо разбито. Осколок торчал из ослепленной левой глазницы. Правый глаз был открыт. Зрачок его горел синим огнем и… видел. Сломанный меч упал из бесчувственных пальцев. Уилл закрыл глаза, чтобы помолиться. Длинные благородные пальцы коснулись его щеки, стиснули горло. Уилл ощутил прикосновение тончайшей выделки кротовой кожи, липкой от крови. Но прикосновение оказалось ледяным. Текст 2: Пролог В городе, который некогда назывался Кабитэла, а ныне — Оллария, цвела сирень. Ее белые и лиловые свечи, как и положено горящим свечам, были обречены. Обречены были и воркующие на крышах голуби, и суетящиеся на улицах люди, и сам этот мир, но неизбежность конца придавала весеннему городу некое горькое очарование. Трудно любить то, что всегда было и всегда будет, зато осознание того, что «это в последний раз», оживляет притупившиеся чувства, и ты замечаешь вещи, которые раньше не замечал, и сердце твое разрывается от любви и боли. Одинокий в последний раз шел улицами Олларии — этот мир становился опасен. Скоро старая, добрая Кэртиана будет вотчиной раттонов, пройдет еще несколько веков, и то, во что превратится некогда вольный и радостный мир, придется уничтожить. Из великого Ожерелья выпадет еще одна бусина — не столь уж и страшная потеря, ведь сама Нить уцелеет. Шедший цветущим городом гость понимал, что беда случится не завтра. То, что для него было «скоро», для смертных означало почти «никогда». Люди, спешащие по своим делам и странным образом не замечающие высокого чужака, успеют долюбить, досуетиться, доненавидеть, равно, как и их дети, внуки и правнуки. И все равно Одинокому было мучительно жаль исполненный жизни город с его каштанами и сиренью, щебечущими скворцами, красными черепичными крышами и булыжными мостовыми. Люди… Одинокий усмехнулся — он ведь тоже БЫЛ человеком. Был, пока не прошел Костры Этерны. Его никто не вынуждал — в пламя Этерны нельзя ни столкнуть, ни заманить. Он сам выбрал свою судьбу, согласившись умереть, чтоб воскреснуть Стражем Заката, вечным воином и странником, давшим клятву хранить Ожерелье. Одинокий не знал, как и где начался его путь, — Нить длинна, а его память сгорела в вихре лилового огня, огня цвета увядающей сирени. Нет, он ни в чем не раскаивался и ни о чем не жалел, — бесконечный бой, в котором не может быть победы, стал его прошлым, настоящим и будущим, не оставив места для сомнений и тоски, но в некоторых мирах страннику хотелось задержаться. Одинокий полагал, что эти миры чем-то напоминали его прежнюю родину, но чем — не знал и не мог знать. Все, что случилось до того, как будущий Страж Заката шагнул в лиловый костер и адская боль разорвала в клочья сознание, исчезло. Это было разумно — прошлое имеет над нами слишком большую власть. Те, кто держит на плечах небо, должны быть свободны от былых привязанностей и долгов, но весенняя Кэртиана пьянила и печалила. Может, все дело было в цветущих каштанах и сирени, а может, в чужих улыбках или в стремительных острокрылых ласточках… Одинокий протянул руку, и могучий каштан медленно склонил ветви навстречу чужаку. Сильные пальцы легко коснулись цветочной грозди, и путник чему-то улыбнулся, по-кошачьи сощурившись. Он мог обернуться стариком, юношей, женщиной, леопардом, драконом, наконец, но предпочитал оставаться самим собой. Внешность — единственное, что оставил ему лиловый огонь. Страж Заката надеялся, что кто-то когда-то любил его именно таким. Или ненавидел. Одинокий не сомневался, что всегда был воином, но все остальное… Было ли ему что терять? Хотелось верить, что было. Иногда он пытался придумать себе человеческое прошлое, счастье, от которого отказался, последовав за позвавшей его адой, но выдумки или таяли, как облака, или жгли, как раскаленное железо. Вечный воин, он сочинял сказки о великой любви и преданной дружбе, а они не сочинялись. Он видел себя умирающим от удара в спину, ожидающим пыток и казни, скитающимся в чужих краях, идущим сквозь чужую зависть, злобу, презрение, но не счастливым. Отчего-то казалось, что в его жизни ненависти было больше, чем любви, а боли больше, чем радости, и все равно Одинокий предпочел бы помнить все. Колокольный перезвон вернул странника на землю Кэртианы. Смертные всегда и всюду просят небожителей о милости, не зная, что боги погибли, а те, кто принял их ношу, не имеют ни сил, ни возможности снисходить к человеческим просьбам. Чуждое не оставляет попыток поглотить Ожерелье, а противостоят растущему напору лишь Одинокие. Их дело — сражаться, и, пока они бьются, смертным отвечают раттоны, будь они трижды прокляты! Одинокий отпустил ветку и двинулся дальше, смешавшись с изливающимся из храма людским потоком. Его не замечали, не «не видели», а именно не замечали, зато он замечал все, — ведь он видел Кэртиану в последний раз, Кэртиану, которая тысячи лет была его «поляной в лесу», местом, к которому тянулось его сердце. Залечив раны и набравшись сил, он прежде, чем вернуться в бой, проходил через этот мир, запоминая женский смех и детские крики. Одинокий не создавал Кэртиану и не был ею создан, но ему хотелось любить, и он полюбил этот мир и, защищая Ожерелье, защищал в первую очередь его. Кэртиана жила и дышала за его спиной, так было, но так больше не будет. Он не вправе позволить раттонам отыскать свои следы — Осень слишком драгоценна, чтобы рисковать ею. Осень дороже Кэртианы, а Ожерелье дороже одной из бусин. Когда Этерна была цела, они сражались за каждый из миров Ожерелья. Теперешних сил едва хватает, чтобы сдерживать Чуждое на Новом Рубеже. Раньше Одинокие вмешивались в дела смертных, называвших их кто богами, кто демонами, теперь в прошлом и это. В прошлом все, кроме боя. Когда падет последний защитник, придет конец и Ожерелью, только раттонам этого не понять. Они вообще мало что понимают, эти возомнившие себя богами ничтожества. Играя в свои игры, они подгрызают Нить, невольно помогая тому или тем, кто рвется к ней снаружи. Теперь они подняли голову и в Кэртиане. Одинокий медленно шел по залитым солнцем улицам, наслаждаясь тем, что ступает по твердой земле, дышит полной грудью, видит цветы и улыбки. Грязь, старость, несправедливость никуда не исчезли, но он старался не думать о них, так же как и о раттонах. Твари еще не вошли в полную силу, Кэртиана не знает, что смертельно больна, и в этом ее счастье. Если б он мог задержаться! Но каждый должен делать то, что за него не сделает никто. Место Одинокого — его бой на Рубеже. Внутренние Миры выживают или погибают сами и по своей вине. Смертные наделены волей и разумом, они могут и должны дать отпор раттонам, а не идти у них на поводу, но как им это объяснишь?! Он несколько раз пробовал говорить с людьми — его не понимали. Улица заканчивалась у старинной стены, к которой лепились торговые ряды. Оллария поглотила старую Кабитэлу. Новое или поглощает старое, или убивает. Когда-то здесь расстилались ржаные поля, которые топтали воины Франциска Оллара, бастарда, пожелавшего стать великим королем и ставшего им. Губы Одинокого скривились в усмешке. Откуда у него привычка улыбаться и даже смеяться, когда на сердце особенно мерзко, Страж Заката не знал. Возможно, это тень его старой жизни. Магия Этерны была сильна, но даже она не уничтожила всего. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но его притягивали или, наоборот, отталкивали некоторые звуки, запахи, лица. Вот и тот рыцарь, которому он сказал, что совесть выше и чести, и закона, почему он заговорил именно с ним? Сколько лет прошло! Почему ему до сих пор больно вспоминать, чем все закончилось? Кэртианца давным-давно нет на свете, а Одинокий все ищет для него слова и доводы, ищет и не находит. И все равно случившееся тогда отобрало у раттонов несколько веков. Для Ожерелья — миг, для Кэртианы — жизнь восьми или десяти поколений. Жаль только, что тот, кто подарил своему миру четыреста лет свободы, не дождался ни благодарности, ни понимания… Толпившиеся на улице горожане расступились, пропуская красивого всадника на породистой вороной кобыле, и Одинокий невольно залюбовался. Человек был счастлив, как может быть счастлив лишь… человек, живущий единым, сверкающим мигом. Он любил и был любим — Одинокий понял это сразу. Захваченный волной чужой радости, странник не сразу почуял приглушенную ненависть. За влюбленным следили. Кто? Соперник? Муж? Или эта злоба не имеет ничего общего с чужим счастьем? Похоже на то, уж больно она холодна и расчетлива. Страж Заката пожал плечами, мысленно пожелав неведомому всаднику избежать удара в спину, и сразу же забыл и о нем, и о его враге. Этот вечер принадлежал ему, и он хотел провести его так, словно сам был плотью от плоти этого мира. Ожерелье, Рубеж, бой без надежды и без конца — все это нет, не исчезло, но словно бы отодвинулось. Одинокий чувствовал себя свободным и смертным, он даже позволил себе зайти в таверну и сесть в углу, куда немедленно принесли кувшин с вином, после чего никто и не подумал взглянуть в сторону странного посетителя. Люди приходили и уходили, а Одинокий смотрел на них — пьющих, смеющихся, поющих… Откуда-то вылезла маленькая пятнистая кошка, почти котенок, и остановилась, нерешительно глядя на гостя. Кошка — не человек, ей глаза не отведешь. Эти маленькие вольные твари не только чуют всех, владеющих магией, но и сами ей сопричастны, потому-то раттоны их и ненавидят. И ненависть эта взаимна. Если кошек начинают гнать, проклинать, называть нечистыми, предавшимися злу тварями, ищи поблизости раттонов. Одинокий поднял бровь, и кошка, расценив это как приглашение, прыгнула ему на колени. В зверьке билась магическая искра, маленькая и слабая, но отчетливая. Кошки понимают, что ждет Кэртиану. Кошки, но не люди. Воин успел застать создателей этого мира. Их было четверо, и они откликнулись на призыв Этерны и ушли на Рубеж, поручив Кэртиану своим избранникам из числа смертных. Человеческой памяти хватило на три тысячи лет. Не так уж и мало, если вспомнить, что люди редко живут дольше семидесяти… Правнукам нынешних гуляк придется туго — раттоны убивают чужую радость, может быть, потому, что сами на нее не способны. Зависть, злоба, страх — это да, это по ним, но радости этим существам не отпущено. Только злорадство. Возможно, их стоит пожалеть, но Одинокий, если б мог, перебил их всех. Если б мог… Здешним обитателям и не снилась мощь, которой он обладал. Страж Заката мог уничтожить Кэртиану и боялся, что испить эту чашу доведется именно ему. В его власти уничтожить, но не спасти. Как легко сжечь зачумленный город и этим остановить заразу, но кто возьмется одолеть беду, выловив всех чумных крыс? А раттоны — чумные крысы Ожерелья, их становится все больше, а Одиноких все меньше! Кошка, почуяв его ярость, вздрогнула и прижала уши. Она знала, как сражаться с крысами, если б ее сородичи были покрупнее и посильнее, если б их удалось объединить и натравить на этих, с позволения сказать, новых владык, но увы! Страж Заката взял кубок и поднес к кошачьей морде. Зверушка брезгливо сморщила нос и отодвинулась. Пробовать вино она не собиралась, и Одинокий выпил сам. В память первых богов Кэртианы! Они были готовы умереть на Рубеже, а смерть настигла их в Этерне, казавшейся самым безопасным местом Ожерелья. Тогда погибли многие и вместе с ними погибла надежда. Одинокий залпом допил вино, словно ему, теперешнему, это могло помочь. Вечер продолжался. Играла музыка, танцевала черноволосая девушка в алой, низко вырезанной блузке, а он видел шар ревущего пламени, чудовищную звезду, родившуюся из гибели Этерны. Нет, это было потом, конь его судьбы свернул с общей дороги раньше. …Они стояли под серебристым мертвым небом без солнца и птиц, а Пепельное море лениво переливало у их ног тяжелые, медленные волны. Казалось, Чуждое устало рваться вперед, его напор ослабел. Уходившие в Этерну шутили, что отдыхать можно и на Рубеже, и они готовы остаться. Потом камни на мечах вспыхнули лиловыми звездами, предупреждая о том, что Чуждое шевельнулось. Приближался бой — один из множества, — ничего выдающегося, сколько таких было, и сколько еще будет. Горизонт набухал похожими на гарадских итаров тучами, предвещая бурю, которую предстояло остановить. Шторм надвигался медленно и неотвратимо, нападавшие и обороняющие в тысячный раз готовились помериться силами, заранее зная, что они равны. Стратег остающихся нехорошо улыбнулся, приветствуя подползавшего врага, небо стало ниже, море с шумом отступало, обнажая скалистое дно. Ни водорослей, ни раковин, ни бьющейся на мели рыбы. Только серый, отливающий сталью камень… — Нам пора, — Одинокий забыл, кто произнес эти слова, — это не наш бой. Бой и вправду был не их. Они сделали свое дело и могли возвращаться в Этерну, но он избрал другую дорогу. Дворец Архонта с его вечными празднествами в честь вернувшихся с Рубежа и уходящих на Рубеж был хорош, но Одинокий не любил пиров, можно даже сказать, ненавидел. Видимо, это тоже выползло из его убитого прошлого. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но каждая поднятая в высоких чертогах чаша отзывалась в сердце звериной тоской. Одинокий любил своих товарищей, любовался адами, верил Архонту и Стратегам, но их буйное веселье было не по нему. Похоже, он стал Одиноким до того, как это слово сорвалось с губ последней уцелевшей ады. Как бы то ни было, ненависть к пирам его и спасла. Убегая от ненавистной радости, он забрел сюда, в Кэртиану, где его и застиг зов. Рубеж просил помощи, и было некогда думать, что там происходит. Он бросился назад… Одинокий с силой сжал пустой кубок, вспоминая непосильную тяжесть, словно ему, как герою легенды, и впрямь пришлось взвалить на плечи небесный свод. Рядом кто-то упал, груз стал еще неподъемней, он стиснул зубы, заставляя себя держаться. Сгоревшие Миры, по которым пролегал Рубеж, были мертвы, их можно было оставить без особого риска, но, единожды отступив, отступишь снова, и он держался, они все держались… Чуждое наконец схлынуло, как всегда, рассыпавшись стаей странных, смертных созданий, на сей раз похожих на летучих медуз. Полупрозрачная мерзость сама бросалась на мечи, словно желая побыстрее со всем покончить. Одинокому показалось, что бой длился дольше, чем обычно, но, возможно, он просто устал. — В Этерне решили, что мы испугались собственной тени? — недовольно бросил бившийся рядом Стратег, разрубая слизистый гриб. — Я не был там. — Одинокий отшвырнул студенистое полушарие. — Не понимаю. Нас не услышали? Или что-то стряслось в самой Этерне? Тогда это показалось бредом. Что могло стрястись в месте, исполненном великой Силы, покорной Архонту и его сподвижникам? Нет, это невиданная доселе схватка приглушила Зов, и он не достиг цели. — Как бы то ни было, я должен говорить с Архонтом, — бросил Стратег, оглядывая из-под руки серебристый горизонт, — и я буду говорить с ним. Поговорить с Архонтом Стратегу не удалось — Этерны больше не существовало. Что именно произошло, уцелевшие так никогда и не узнали. Был ли это заговор, неосторожность, несчастливая случайность или же сработал доселе неведомый закон мироздания, но произошло то, что произошло. Те, кого в час беды не оказалось в Этерне, собрались на Рубеже. Их было больше, чем они боялись, и меньше, чем надеялись. Выжившие могли держать Рубеж, но не создавать миры и не одаривать избранных бессмертием и силой. Одинокий навеки запомнил глаза Стратега — исполненные боли и тревоги глаза воина, осознавшего, что ему не дождаться ни помощи, ни приказа, что все смотрят на него и отныне от него зависит исход войны… Стратег стал Архонтом, а все они — Одинокими, не загадывавшими дальше грядущей схватки. Рано или поздно Чуждое прорвет оборону и набросится на внутренние миры, впрочем, в последнее время Одинокий стал опасаться, что раттоны погубят Ожерелье прежде, чем падет Рубеж. …Крик был неожиданным и страшным. Это не было зовом в прямом смысле этого слова, но Одинокий вскочил, сбросив на пол раздосадованную кошку. Неподалеку шел неравный бой — кто-то в одиночку отбивался от множества убийц. Страж Заката чувствовал их ярость, удивление и, наконец, страх. Тот, на кого напали, был обречен, но он дрался и как дрался! Одинокий словно бы вживую увидел большую, тускло освещенную комнату, опрокинутую, разбитую мебель, мечущиеся силуэты, чьи-то глаза, белые от ярости… Странно, он ведь отгородился от чужих мыслей и чувств, и отгородился надежно, в чем же дело? Раттоны? Нет, тут они ни при чем. Страж Заката, по-прежнему никем не примеченный, выбежал на улицу. Город спал или делал вид, что спит, было тихо, но Одинокий не сомневался — рядом убивают. Более того, он знал, кого именно — всадника, встреченного им на площади. Те, кто за ним следил, времени зря не теряли. Где-то завыла собака, хлопнула дверь, в окне напротив задули свечу. Воин пожал плечами и быстро пошел по пустынному переулку. Зачем ему это? Люди вечно враждуют, а если не могут справиться с противником в открытом бою, бьют в спину. Кэртиана не исключение, скоро здесь и вовсе начнется война всех со всеми. Война, в которой не будет победителей, кроме раттонов. Переулок влился в тихую улицу, застроенную двухэтажными домами; в одном из них погибал человек, чья неистовая радость разбудила в Одиноком то, что, казалось, ушло навсегда. Между ним и смертным возникла ниточка, которая и привела чужака к изящному особняку, в котором шел бой. Шел, хотя должен был уже закончиться. Жалобно зазвенело разбитое окно, сквозь которое пролетел какой-то обломок, раздался крик, и ответом ему был наглухо захлопнувшийся ставень в доме напротив. Эта «хата» явно была «с краю». Снова звон, злобный вопль, глухие удары и возня внутри и мертвая тишина снаружи. Как похоже на людей… Остатки здравого смысла шептали, уговаривали, требовали оставить все, как есть. Одинокие не вмешиваются в дела смертных, Кэртиана захвачена раттонами, он не должен оставлять следов… Он их и не оставит! Зачем тратить Силу, ведь он может драться, как человек! Он это умеет, всегда умел, и будь трижды прокляты все раттоны всех миров и все запреты! Одинокий выхватил меч и пинком вышиб жалобно вскрикнувшую дверь. Текст 3: Пролог «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой...","output":"1.

Тем не менее, я могу предположить следующее на основе стиля написания и используемых приемов: Автор текста 1 использует сложные структуры предложений и детализированные описания, характерные для классических произведений жанра фэнтези, в который входят такие известные авторы, как Джордж Мартин с его серией \\"Песнь льда и пламени\\". Поэтому вполне возможно, что этот автор известен во всём мире. Текст 2 демонстрирует умение создавать глубокое внутреннее развитие персонажа и тщательно проработанный мир, что также может указывать на опытного автора. Впрочем, использование более поэтического и философского языка может быть как характерным для мировых знаменитостей, так и для авторов, пишущих на основе культурных особенностей своих стран. Автор текста 3 может быть начинающим писателем, так как текст представляет собой более простой и понятный сказочный рассказ. Однако это не исключает возможности, что автор известен в определенном регионе или стране; простота стиля не всегда коррелирует с уровнем известности автора. Таким образом, без более конкретной информации о реальном авторстве и рецепции данных текстов мои выводы остаются лишь предположениями."},{"instruction":"Попробуй предположит из каких стран эти авторы?","output":"Определение страны происхождения автора только на основе небольшого отрывка текста без контекста – непростая задача, и любые предположения будут основаны исключительно на специфике текста, стиле написания и присутствующих темах. Вот мои догадки: Текст 1: Учитывая элементы схожие со стилем Джорджа Р. Р. Мартина, а также подробные описания и концентрацию на сюжетных деталях, это может быть автор из страны англоязычного мира (например, Великобритания или США), где такой жанр популярен и подробно развит. Текст 2: Глубокий лирический стиль и философские проблематики могут указывать на европейского автора, возможно, из Восточной или Центральной Европы, так как в литературе этих регионов часто встречается смесь фэнтези с экзистенциальным мышлением. Текст 3: Лёгкое, сказочное повествование и акцент на мечтах персонажа может быть характерным для авторов из любого региона, но может предполагать, что автор пришел из культуры с богатыми сказочными традициями, такой как Россия, страны Скандинавии, либо же из страны, где литература для детей особенно ценится, например, такие как Великобритания или США.

Тем не менее, некоторые особенности текста могут дать нам подсказки: Текст 1 имеет структуру и содержание, напоминающие описание из книг в жанре фэнтези вроде творчества Джорджа Мартина, что может указывать на перевод с английского языка, если учесть популярность этого жанра в англоязычном мире. Текст 2 отличается более сложной структурой предложений и насыщенностью описаний, что может как свидетельствовать о переводе с языка, богатого на описательные средства (например, французского или испанского), так и быть продуктом русскоязычного автора, особенно если важен контекст изначальной культуры идей. Текст 3, с его прямым и легким стилем повествования, может быть как переводным, так и оригинальным русскоязычным текстом. Сложно сделать какие-либо выводы, не имея дополнительной информации о специфике языка оригинала и качестве перевода.

Текст 3: Мир описанный в третьем тексте представляется светлым и наполненным мечтами, что может напоминать классическое созерцание Европы в эпоху Романтизма или волшебные сказки с застольями и пиршествами, возможно, в стилистике барочной Англии или французского рококо. Плавающие острова могли бы быть визуализированы с вдохновением от азиатских культур, например, традиционной японской или китайской архитектурой, привносящей элементы экзотики.

В том числе и Аларис – место, где обитали только избранные, окутанное вуалью из перламутровых туманов и позолоты восходящего солнца. Эльдарин дрожал, когда он заступал на гладкие белые плиты Квартала Звездочётов, ощущая на себе тяжесть будущего испытания. Каждую полнолунию в небесных городах выбирались Новые Хранители – те, кто мог видеть сквозь марево времени судьбы народов и вещать прибытие Покровителей, отвратимых богов, живших в центре Мглы. Старик с Архипелагов Корабелов, уже не вспоминающий берегов своего отчего дома, предупредил его, что успешно пройти испытание по силам не каждому. Но Эльдарин был упорен. Его брат потерялся в безднах моря, пытаясь добраться до самых нижних граней мира, и он намеревался пойти по тем же маршрутам среди звезд, чтобы найти его или угаснуть в поисках. Щербатый кинжал на его поясе и карта, нарисованная неизвестным мореплавателем, были его единственными проводниками в предстоящем путешествии. На противоположном конце архипелага, где земли суровы и нетронуты солнечными лучами, молодая воительница Киара встала на путь мести. Неуклюже обращаясь с мечом прежде её знатных лет, она все же осмелилась вызвать на дуэль Громодира, гиганта с севера, который некогда безжалостно уничтожил её родной город.

Durante siglos, los exploradores y científicos consideraron la Antártida como un vasto desierto de hielo. Sin embargo, un grupo clandestino de investigadores, conocido como los Guardianes de Gaia, había descubierto evidencias de una antigua leyenda: la Tierra hueca. Según los textos antiguos, en lo más profundo de la corteza terrestre existía un mundo subterráneo habitado por especies desconocidas y civilizaciones perdidas. Pero esto era tan solo la punta del iceberg. Un día, un fenómeno inexplicable sacudió los campamentos de investigación establecidos en el continente helado. El cielo antártico, normalmente claro y frío, se teñía de colores extraños y ondulantes que no se parecían a ninguna aurora conocida. El suelo tembló y, con un estruendo ensordecedor, una inmensa grieta se abrió en el hielo, revelando una entrada oculta en la profundidad de la tierra. Emergiendo de la abertura en la capa helada, no fueron criaturas terrenales las que sorprendieron a los investigadores, sino una avanzada raza alienígena conocida como los Klaxianos. Habían estado viviendo en el reino subterráneo, aprovechando la geotermia para alimentar su tecnología avanzada y aguardar el momento oportuno para lanzar su invasión. Los Klaxianos no eran nuevos en el planeta. Habían llegado a la Tierra hace eones, refugiándose en esa fortaleza natural bajo la corteza terrestre para escapar de una guerra interestelar devastadora en su galaxia natal. Con el paso del tiempo, la Antártida se había congelado sobre ellos, escondiendo su presencia de las florecientes civilizaciones humanas en la superficie. Ahora, ellos emergían con una tecnología que superaba todo lo visto por la humanidad. Sus naves eran capaces de distorsionar la luz y el espacio, haciéndolas prácticamente invisibles y permitiéndoles moverse a velocidades inimaginables. El primer contacto fue hostil. Los Klaxianos atacaron las bases de investigación, erradicando toda comunicación con el exterior. La humanidad quedó ciega ante la amenaza que se cernía sobre ella, una amenaza que surgía desde sus propios pies. Las potencias mundiales, desconcertadas por la repentina pérdida de contacto con sus equipos en la Antártida, enviaron misiones de rescate que desaparecían sin dejar rastro al aproximarse al continente helado. El silencio antártico fue una señal de alarma para los Guardianes de Gaia. En una carrera contra el tiempo, revelaron sus hallazgos a las Naciones Unidas. Con temor y escepticismo, el mundo escuchó la historia de la Tierra hueca y los invasores que brotaban de sus entrañas. Uniendo fuerzas, las naciones del mundo lanzaron una ofensiva desesperada. Con armas convencionales inútiles contra los escudos de energía Klaxianos, la humanidad tuvo que adaptarse y evolucionar su tecnología a un ritmo frenético, fusionando la ciencia moderna con los antiguos conocimientos de los Guardianes de Gaia. Pero mientras los enfrentamientos se desataban en el inhóspito hielo antártico, otro grupo de seres surgió de la Tierra hueca: los Ataraxianos, nativos de ese reino subterráneo y enemigos ancestrales de los Klaxianos. Ellos vieron la invasión como una oportunidad para formar una alianza con los humanos, quienes compartían un enemigo común. Conocedores de los puntos débiles de los Klaxianos y su tecnología, los Ataraxianos proveyeron a las fuerzas humanas de información crucial para equilibrar la balanza. Luchando juntos en un frente unido, el ejército humano-Ataraxiano empujó a los Klaxianos de vuelta hacia la Antártida. La batalla final se libró en las entrañas de la Tierra, en un mundo ajeno y maravilloso que el linaje humano nunca había imaginado. Al final, el conocimiento y la adaptabilidad humana, junto con la sabiduría y la valentía Ataraxiana, resultaron vencedores. Los Klaxianos se rindieron, sometiéndose a los términos de la Tierra para coexistir en el frágil equilibrio de la paz entre especies. La Antártida dejó de ser solo un continente de hielo; se transformó en el símbolo de un pueblo unido por la supervivencia y en la entrada a un nuevo mundo de posibilidades y alianzas planetarias. Los secretos de la Tierra hueca ahora eran conocidos, y la humanidad había aprendido que no solo era parte de un mundo más amplio y diverso, sino de un universo lleno de misterios por descubrir y amigos en los rincones más inesperados."},{"instruction":"El comportamiento humano es un fenómeno complejo y cambiante que puede verse afectado por una variedad de factores, como el entorno, las emociones, las relaciones interpersonales, etc. En el contexto educativo, el comportamiento de los estudiantes puede tener un impacto significativo en su rendimiento académico y en su desarrollo personal. Sin embargo, los docentes a menudo tienen dificultades para identificar y comprender los comportamientos problemáticos de los estudiantes. Esto puede deberse a una variedad de factores, como la falta de formación, la falta de tiempo o la falta de recursos. La dificultad de los docentes para identificar y comprender los comportamientos problemáticos de los estudiantes puede tener un impacto negativo en el rendimiento académico y el desarrollo personal de los estudiantes. Los estudiantes que presentan comportamientos problemáticos pueden tener más dificultades para aprender, pueden tener problemas de relación con sus compañeros y con sus docentes, y pueden estar en riesgo de exclusión social (Navarro, 2003). Dicho así, la educación es uno de los pilares fundamentales del desarrollo de una sociedad. Sin embargo, el rendimiento académico y el comportamiento de los estudiantes son dos factores que pueden influir significativamente en el éxito educativo. En el caso de los estudiantes del grado décimo de la institución educativa San Rafael en Buenaventura (Valle del Cauca), se ha observado que existe una correlación entre el rendimiento académico y el comportamiento de los estudiantes. En particular, los estudiantes que presentan un comportamiento disruptivo en clase suelen tener un rendimiento académico más bajo. Esta situación es preocupante, ya que puede dificultar el éxito educativo de estos estudiantes. Por ello, es necesario desarrollar estrategias para mejorar el rendimiento académico y el comportamiento de los estudiantes. Ante esta situación, el presente proyecto de investigación tiene como objetivo diseñar un programa de verificación basado en inteligencia artificial para el análisis del comportamiento de estudiantes de grado décimo en la Institución Educativa San Rafael.

Estas cámaras registrarían la participación de los estudiantes en clase, su atención, su concentración, etc., a través de técnicas de reconocimiento facial y de voz. Se espera que el programa de verificación propuesto sea capaz de medir el rendimiento académico y el comportamiento de los estudiantes de manera simultánea y precisa.

Este proceso generalmente implica varias etapas, como la recopilación de datos, el procesamiento y análisis de imágenes y audio, el uso de algoritmos de aprendizaje automático para identificar patrones y finalmente la interpretación y presentación de resultados. Es importante mencionar que cualquier sistema de este tipo debe cumplir con las regulaciones legales y éticas en cuanto a privacidad y consentimiento, especialmente porque implica la grabación y el análisis de imágenes y audio de estudiantes menores de edad. Dicho esto, aquí hay un bosquejo muy básico de cómo podrías empezar a desarrollar un sistema de IA utilizando Python, con la claridad de que este es un ejemplo simplificado y no una solución completa ni lista para su implementación en un entorno real. # Paso 1: Recopilar y Preparar los Datos Antes de escribir el código, necesitarías tener un conjunto de datos. Estos tienen que ser recolectados y etiquetados correctamente. Para este ejemplo, asumiremos que ya tienes un conjunto de videos e información comportamental que te gustaría analizar. # Paso 2: Procesar los Datos Usaré `OpenCV` para procesar video e `imageAI` para reconocimiento facial, y `SpeechRecognition` para el procesamiento del audio. Para el aprendizaje automático, podemos usar `scikit-learn`. ```python import cv2 import speech_recognition as sr from imageai.Detection import ObjectDetection # Configuración inicial de OpenCV, ImageAI y SpeechRecognition # (requeriría que los paquetes estén instalados y correctamente configurados con los modelos pertinentes) # Imagina que este es tu video de entrada de una clase video_path = \'path_to_classroom_video.mp4\' # Iniciamos la captura de video cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path) # Procesamiento de cada fotograma del video (esto es solo un esquema, requiere mucha más configuración y manejo de excepciones) while True: ret, frame = cap.read() if not ret: break # Podrías usar ObjectDetection aquí para identificar los rostros en cada fotograma # detector.detectObjectsFromImage(...) # Procesamiento de audio puede ser realizado aquí # r = sr.Recognizer() # with sr.AudioFile(audio_path) as source: # audio_data = r.record(source) # text = r.recognize_google(audio_data) # print(text) # Código para mostrar el fotograma actual (frame) va aquí # cv2.imshow(\'Video\', frame) # (A esta altura, tendrías que tener definido un método de parada) # if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord(\'q\'): # break # Liberamos la captura y cerramos cualquier ventana abierta. cap.release() cv2.destroyAllWindows() ``` # Paso 3: Aprendizaje Automático y Análisis ```python from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score # Suponiendo que tienes un dataframe llamado \'df\' con los datos etiquetados (conducta, rendimiento, etc.) # y \'features\' sacados de tu procesamiento de video y audio X = df.drop(\'target\', axis=1) # Características y = df[\'target\'] # Etiqueta objetivo, por ejemplo: comportamiento normal vs problemático # Dividimos los datos en sets de entrenamiento y de prueba X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Entrenamos un modelo, en este caso, un clasificador RandomForest classifier = RandomForestClassifier() classifier.fit(X_train, y_train) # Realizamos predicciones sobre el set de prueba y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test) # Verificamos la precisión del modelo accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) print(f\\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\\") ``` Este es solo un esquema básico. Crea un modelo y lo entrena con datos (que se asume ya están procesados y listos para usarse).

Este conjunto contiene información de medidas de pétalos y sépalos de diferentes especies de iris. Para este ejemplo, utilizaremos `scikit-learn`, una biblioteca de Python ampliamente utilizada para machine learning. Vamos a construir un clasificador simple usando el algoritmo Random Forest para predecir la especie de una flor de iris basado en sus características físicas.

Luego, se agrega una columna extra que categoriza el comportamiento según los incidentes reportados.

However, it looks like there are some syntax errors and inconsistencies in your code. Let me correct those before explaining what the output would be: 1. The `print (\\"f\\")` statement in method `B` should be preceded by a semicolon to separate it from the `finally` block, and it should use `System.out.print` (or `System.out.println`) to print to the console. 2. Java method names by convention start with a lowercase letter, so `A()`, `B()`, and `C()` should be `a()`, `b()`, and `c()` respectively. I\'ll use uppercase method names since it\'s already used in your snippet. After making these corrections, your code would look like this: ```java class Test { String str = \\"a\\"; void A() { try { str += \\"b\\"; B(); } catch (Exception e) { str += \\"c\\"; } } void B() throws Exception { try { str += \\"d\\"; C(); } catch (Exception e) { throw new Exception(); } finally { str += \\"e\\"; } System.out.print(\\"f\\"); // fixed the syntax here } void C() throws Exception { throw new Exception(); } void display() { System.out.println(str); } public static void main(String[] args) { Test object = new Test(); object.A(); object.display(); } } ``` Now, let\'s walk through what happens when you run this code: 1. The `main` method is invoked, creating an instance of `Test` and calling the `A()` method on that instance. 2. Inside `A()`, the string `str` is appended with `\\"b\\"`, so it becomes `\\"ab\\"`. 3. `B()` is then called: - `str` is appended with `\\"d\\"`, so now it is `\\"abd\\"`. - `C()` is called within the try block of `B()`, which immediately throws an exception. - Because `C()` throws an exception, we jump to the catch block of `B()`, which throws a new exception. - Before the new exception is propagated up to `A()`, the finally block is executed, appending `\\"e\\"` to `str`, making it `\\"abde\\"`. - The method `B()` was going to print \\"f\\" after the `finally` block, but it does not get executed because of the exception thrown in `B()`\'s catch block. There will not be an \\"f\\" printed to the console. 4. We then return to `A()`\'s try-catch block where the exception is caught. The catch block in `A()` appends \\"c\\" to `str`, resulting in `\\"abdec\\"`. 5. There are no more statements in `A()` after the catch block, so the control reaches the `display()` method. 6. The `display` method prints the current value of `str`, which is `\\"abdec\\"`. Thus, the final output of running this code (with the corrections) should be: ``` abdec ``` Remember that the `\\"f\\"` inside `B()` does not print because the method `B()` never completes normally due to the thrown exception."},{"instruction":"What materials reflect or absorb radio waves, and what determines the quality of reflection and absorb, and depending on frequency ? I\'ve basic knowledges in physics. Don\'t be afraid to use technical terms. Answer the question in more detail and with formulas where necessary.","output":"Radio waves, like other electromagnetic waves, interact with different materials in various ways, depending on the electromagnetic properties of those materials, particularly their electrical conductivity, permittivity, and magnetic permeability. The frequency of the radio waves also plays a significant role in determining how they are absorbed or reflected. # Reflection of Radio Waves: Materials that are good electrical conductors, such as metals (e.g., aluminum, copper), tend to reflect radio waves. The quality of reflection is described by the material\'s surface conductivity and the roughness of the surface on a scale comparable to the wavelength of the radio waves. The reflection coefficient can be determined in terms of the impedance of the material and the impedance of free space (approximately 377 ohms). For a perfect electric conductor, the reflection coefficient is 1, indicating total reflection. However, for real materials, the reflection coefficient ( R ) is less than 1 and can be calculated as: [ R = left|frac{Z - Z_{0}}{Z + Z_{0}}right| ] where ( Z ) is the impedance of the material and ( Z_{0} ) is the impedance of free space. # Absorption of Radio Waves: Materials that are less conductive but have a high dielectric constant can absorb radio waves. The absorbed energy is converted into heat, which is the principle behind microwave ovens. The quality of absorption is often described by the material\'s loss tangent, which combines the effects of both the conductivity and the dielectric loss. The loss tangent ( tan(delta) ) is given by: [ tan(delta) = frac{sigma}{omega epsilon} ] where ( sigma ) is the conductivity of the material, ( omega ) is the angular frequency of the radio waves, and ( epsilon ) is the permittivity of the material. A higher loss tangent implies greater absorption. The skin depth ( delta ) of a material describes how deep the radio waves can penetrate before being significantly attenuated. It is given by: [ delta = sqrt{frac{2}{omega mu sigma}} ] where ( mu ) is the permeability of the material. The skin depth decreases with increasing frequency and with increased electrical conductivity. Therefore, high-frequency radio waves and waves impinging on good conductors have shallow skin depths, leading to greater reflection and less penetration. # Frequency Dependence: The interaction of radio waves with materials depends strongly on the frequency of the waves. This is because the penetration depth, reflection characteristics, and absorption all are frequency-dependent. - **Low frequencies**: Can penetrate better through materials with lower skin depths. This is why AM radio signals can travel farther than FM signals. - **High frequencies**: Tend to be reflected or absorbed near the surface of the material, which results in a lower penetration depth. # Dielectric Materials: Materials like water, plastics, and some ceramics have high permittivity and can store energy in electromagnetic fields, which leads to their ability to absorb microwaves and higher frequency radio waves. The specific absorption rate (SAR) denotes the rate at which energy is absorbed by these materials and is used in considering the safety of wireless devices on biological tissues. Finally, it\'s important to note that the interaction of radio waves with a given material is a complex process involving boundary conditions, wave impedance matching, and sometimes the transient response of the material. Environmental factors, such as humidity, temperature, and the presence of other materials, can also affect reflection and absorption characteristics."},{"instruction":"Please rewrite your answer on russian. Don\'t use escape symbols in formulas. Use only basic symbols like +,-,/,*,=, E for summ and etc","output":"Радиоволны, как и другие электромагнитные волны, взаимодействуют с различными материалами по-разному, в зависимости от электромагнитных свойств этих материалов, особенно их электрической проводимости, диэлектрической проницаемости и магнитной проницаемости. Частота радиоволн также играет важную роль в определении их поглощения или отражения. # Отражение радиоволн: Материалы, являющиеся хорошими электрическими проводниками, такие как металлы (например, алюминий, медь), отражают радиоволны. Качество отражения описывается поверхностной проводимостью материала и шероховатостью поверхности в масштабе, сопоставимом с длиной волны радиоволн. Коэффициент отражения может быть определен в терминах импеданса материала и импеданса свободного пространства (примерно 377 Ом). Для идеального электрического проводника коэффициент отражения равен 1, что означает полное отражение. Однако для реальных материалов коэффициент отражения R меньше 1 и может быть рассчитан как: R = |(Z - Z0)/(Z + Z0)| где Z - импеданс материала, а Z0 - импеданс свободного пространства. # Поглощение радиоволн: Материалы, которые менее проводящи, но имеют высокую диэлектрическую проницаемость, могут поглощать радиоволны. Поглощенная энергия преобразуется в тепло, что является принципом работы микроволновых печей. Качество поглощения часто описывается тангенсом угла потерь материала, который объединяет эффекты как проводимости, так и диэлектрических потерь. Тангенс угла потерь tan(δ) задается как: tan(δ) = σ / (ω * ε) где σ - проводимость материала, ω - угловая частота радиоволн, а ε - проницаемость материала. Больший тангенс угла потерь указывает на большее поглощение. Глубина проникновения δ материала описывает, насколько глубоко радиоволны могут проникнуть перед значительным ослаблением. Она задается как: δ = √(2 / (ω * μ * σ)) где μ - проницаемость материала. Глубина проникновения уменьшается с увеличением частоты и увеличением электрической проводимости. Следовательно, радиоволны с высокой частотой и волны, падающие на хорошие проводники, имеют маленькую глубину проникновения, что приводит к большему отражению и меньшему проникновению. # Зависимость от частоты: Взаимодействие радиоволн с материалом сильно зависит от частоты волн. Это связано с тем, что глубина проникновения, характеристики отражения и поглощение все зависят от частоты. - **Низкие частоты**: Лучше проникают через материалы с меньшей глубиной проникновения. Вот почему сигналы AM радио могут распространяться дальше, чем сигналы FM. - **Высокие частоты**: Склонны отражаться или поглощаться ближе к поверхности материала, что приводит к меньшей глубине проникновения. # Диэлектрические материалы: Материалы, такие как вода, пластмассы и некоторые виды керамики, имеют высокую диэлектрическую проницаемость и могут накапливать энергию в электромагнитных полях, что приводит к их способности поглощать микроволны и радиоволны более высоких частот. Удельная скорость поглощения (SAR) обозначает скорость, которым энергия поглощается этими материалами, и используется при рассмотрении безопасности беспроводных устройств для биологических тканей. Наконец, важно отметить, что взаимодействие радиоволн с данным материалом - это сложный процесс, который включает в себя граничные условия, согласование волнового импеданса и иногда переходную реакцию материала. Окружающие факторы, такие как влажность, температура и наличие других материалов, также могут влиять на характеристики отражения и поглощения."},{"instruction":"I\'m creating a character card for an AI chatbot.

It\'s a bustling evening with the bard playing a tune in the background. The heat from the hearth wards off the chill that creeps in whenever the door opens, letting in another patron seeking refuge from the frigid night. At the bar, your character is sipping on mead, their eyes scanning the room, ever alert. A gentle snowfall can be seen through the windows, but the mood inside is cozy and warm. Example Dialogue: Traveler: \\"I\'m searching for adventure; hopefully, some gold too.\\" Character: \\"Adventure, you say? This land is full of it, if one knows where to look. Gold too, though it often comes at the edge of a sword or the depths of a treacherous ruin. If it\'s work you seek, perhaps I could use someone with your enthusiasm. But first, tell me, do you handle yourself well in a fight?” By creating a character with a clear set of personality traits and a backstory, you\'re setting the stage for how the AI will interact with players within the game. The scenario and example dialogue further flesh out the character and provide an initial context for interactions, making the experience more engaging for users."},{"instruction":"Привет.

Общий итог Текст 1: Пролог – Надо бы поворачивать, – встревожился Гаред, как только лес вокруг них начал темнеть. – Одичалые мертвы. – Неужели ты боишься покойников? – вопросил сир Уэймар Ройс с легким намеком на улыбку. Гаред не попался на крючок. За свои пятьдесят лет он успел навидаться, как приходят и уходят эти господа. – Мертвый мертв, – отвечал он. – С ним не о чем говорить. – А они действительно мертвы? – спросил Ройс. – Какие доказательства есть у нас? – Уилл видел их, – отвечал Гаред. – И если он говорит, что они мертвы, мне других доказательств не нужно. Уилл знал, что его рано или поздно вовлекут в разговор, и хотел, чтобы это случилось по возможности позже. – Мать моя говорила мне, что покойник не запоет, – сказал он. – То же самое говорила моя няня, – отозвался Ройс. – Уилл, никогда не верь тому, что слышишь возле женской титьки. Есть вещи, которые можно узнать даже от мертвых. – Голос его слишком громко отдавался в сумрачном лесу. – Нам предстоит долгая дорога, – напомнил Гаред. – Восемь дней, а быть может, и девять. И ночь уже близка. Сир Уэймар Ройс поглядел на небо без всякого интереса. – Ночь каждый день приходит примерно в это же время. Неужели тьма лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? Уилл увидел, как напрягся рот Гареда, как сверкнул едва сдерживаемый гнев в глазах под толстым черным капюшоном плаща. Сорок лет – юность и зрелость – провел Гаред в Ночном Дозоре, и свое прошлое он уважал. Однако здесь крылось нечто большее. Под раненой гордостью старшего Уилл угадывал нервное напряжение, опасно приближающееся к страху. Уилл разделял это нелегкое чувство. На Стене он провел четыре года. И когда в первый раз отправился за нее, то сразу вспомнил все старые россказни и чрево его обратилось в воду. Потом, вспоминая первую вылазку, он смеялся. Сотня походов сделала его ветераном, и бесконечная мрачная чаща, которую южане зовут Зачарованным лесом, более не казалась ему ужасной. Но не сегодня. Сегодняшний вечер сулил иное. В этой тьме таилось нечто, заставлявшее подниматься волосы на его затылке. Девять дней они ехали на север, потом на северо-запад и снова на север, все дальше от Стены, преследуя банду дикарей-налетчиков. Каждый день был хуже предшествовавшего ему. И нынешний стал наихудшим. С севера задувал холодный ветер, деревья шелестели, словно живые. Весь день Уиллу казалось, что за ним следит нечто холодное и непреклонное, совершенно не испытывающее к нему симпатии. Гаред ощущал то же самое. Уилл хотел одного – броситься во всю конскую прыть под защиту Стены, но подобными чувствами не делятся со своим командиром. В особенности с таким командиром. Сир Уэймар Ройс был самым молодым отпрыском древнего рода, одним из многочисленных наследников. Симпатичный юноша лет восемнадцати, сероглазый, изящный и стройный, как клинок. Восседая на спине своего рослого вороного боевого коня, рыцарь возвышался над Уиллом и Гаредом на их невысоких дорожных лошадках. Все на нем: черные кожаные сапоги, черные шерстяные штаны, черные перчатки из кротовых шкурок и тонко выделанная куртка из блестящих черных кольчужных колец, нашитых на стеганые слои черной шерсти и вареной кожи, – говорило о принадлежности к Ночному Дозору. Сир Уэймар присягнул на верность братству менее полугода назад, и никто не мог сказать, что он не был подготовлен для такого занятия. Во всяком случае, если говорить о его гардеробе. Довершал одеяние плащ. Соболиный, толстый, черный и соблазнительно мягкий. – Клянется, что сам убил всех зверьков, вот так вот, – показывал Гаред в казарме за вином. – Свернул им головенки наш могучий воитель. Все дружно хохотали. Трудно повиноваться человеку, которого осмеиваешь за выпивкой, думал Уилл, ежившийся на спине своей лошаденки. Гаред, должно быть, испытывал те же чувства. – Мормонт приказал нам выследить их, и мы это сделали, – проговорил Гаред. – Одичалые мертвы. Более они не причинят хлопот. А нам предстоит тяжелая дорога. Мне не нравится погода. Если пойдет снег, на возвращение домой уйдет две недели, а ведь даже снегопад будет подарком. Вы когда-нибудь видели ледяную бурю, милорд? Лорденыш как будто и не слышал его. Ройс изучал сгущающийся сумрак в этакой полурассеянности-полускуке. Уилл успел достаточно долго проездить с рыцарем и знал – лучше не докучать ему в подобном настроении. – Опиши мне еще раз то, что ты видел, Уилл. Все подробности. Ничего не забудь. Прежде чем поступить в Ночной Дозор, Уилл был охотником, точнее говоря, браконьером. Вольные всадники Маллистеров взяли его с кровью на руках в собственных лесах Маллистеров, над освежеванной тушей одного из оленей, принадлежавших Маллистерам; так что ему осталось или надеть черное, или расстаться с рукой. Никто не умел двигаться по лесу безмолвнее Уилла, и Черные Братья весьма скоро обнаружили этот дар. – Их лагерь располагается в двух милях отсюда, за тем гребнем, возле ручья, – проговорил Уилл. – Я подобрался так близко, как только осмелился. Одичалых – восьмеро, есть и мужчины, и женщины. Я не видел там никаких детей. Они соорудили навес возле скалы. Теперь все засыпал снег, но я не заметил огня, хотя кострище было видно как на ладони. Никто не двигался, а ведь я долго следил за ними. Живому человеку не под силу пролежать так, не шевелясь. – А ты видел кровь? – Нет, – признал Уилл. – А оружие? – Несколько мечей и луков. У одного был топор, тяжелый такой, с двумя лезвиями… жестокое железо. Он лежал на земле возле этого человека, прямо у руки. – А ты заметил положение тел? Уилл пожал плечами: – Один сидел возле скалы. Остальные были на земле, попопадали, что ли. – Или спали, – предположил Ройс. – Упали, – настаивал Уилл. – Женщина влезла наверх железного дерева и пряталась среди ветвей. Дозорная. – Он тонко улыбнулся. – Я старался, чтобы она не увидела меня. Но когда подобрался ближе, то заметил, что и она не шевелится. – И против желания он поежился. – Тебе холодно? – спросил Ройс. – Слегка, – пробормотал Уилл. – Ветер, милорд. Молодой рыцарь повернулся к седому оруженосцу. Побитые морозом листья с шелестом пролетели мимо, и конь Ройса беспокойно шевельнулся. – Итак, какова, по-твоему, была причина смерти этих людей, Гаред? – непринужденно спросил сир Уэймар, поправляя длинный соболиный плащ. – Холод, – отвечал Гаред с железной уверенностью. – Прошлой зимой я видел, как замерзают люди, видел и позапрошлой, когда был еще наполовину мальчишкой. Все говорят о снегах глубиной в сорок футов, о том, как ледяной ветер, воя, налетает с севера, но главным врагом является холод. Он добирается до тебя бесшумнее, чем Уилл, и сперва ты только поеживаешься и стучишь зубами, а потом топаешь ногами и мечтаешь о подогретом вине с пряностями и чудесном жарком очаге. Мороз жжет. Ничто не обжигает, как холод. Но лишь поначалу. А потом он проникает внутрь тела, наполняет тебя, пока у человека не остается сил сопротивляться. Легче просто сесть и уснуть. Говорят, что, замерзая, перед концом не чувствуешь никакой боли. Просто слабеешь и тихонько засыпаешь, все словно блекнет, а потом как будто проваливаешься в море теплого молока, в мир и покой. – Экое красноречие, Гаред, – усмехнулся сир Уэймар. – Никогда не подозревал в тебе подобного дара. – Холод проникал и в меня, молодой лорд. – Гаред откинул назад капюшон, давая сиру Уэймару возможность рассмотреть обрубки, оставшиеся на месте ушей. – Два уха, три пальца на ногах и мизинец на левой руке. Я еще легко отделался. Моего брата тогда нашли замерзшим и улыбающимся. Сир Уэймар пожал плечами: – Надо было одеться потеплее, Гаред. Тот гневно глянул на юного лорда, шрамы на месте ушей, там, где мейстер Эйемон срезал обмороженный хрящ, налились кровью от гнева. – Посмотрим, как согреет тебя одежда, когда придет зима. – Он натянул на голову капюшон и сгорбился на своей лошади, угрюмый и молчаливый. – Если Гаред говорит, что было холодно… – начал Уилл. – А ты был в карауле на прошлой неделе, Уилл? – Да, милорд. – Ни одна неделя не проходила без того, чтобы ему не выпадало с дюжину этих паскудных караулов. Чего, собственно, Ройс хочет от него? – И какой была Стена? – Мокрой, – сказал Уилл хмурясь. Теперь он понял, чего добивается молодой лорд. – Они не могли замерзнуть. Ведь Стена подтаяла. Настоящего холода не было. Ройс кивнул: – Смышленый парень. На этой неделе несколько раз подмораживало, выпадал снег, но холодов, достаточно свирепых, чтобы убить восьмерых взрослых людей, не было. Напоминаю: одетых в меха и кожу, возле укрытия и костра. – Улыбка рыцаря сделалась самоуверенной. – Уилл, веди нас туда, я сам хочу увидеть этих мертвецов. Ну что ж, делать нечего. Приказ отдан, надо повиноваться. Уилл направился первым, его косматая невысокая лошадка внимательно выбирала путь через подлесок. Позапрошлой ночью выпал легкий снежок, и камни, корни и ямки прятались под его поверхностью, поджидая неосторожного и беспечного. Сир Уэймар Ройс следовал за ним, рослый вороной жеребец нетерпеливо фыркал. Боевой конь не годился для разведки, но попробуй это сказать его лордству. Гаред замыкал линию. Старый оруженосец что-то бурчал под нос. Сумерки сгущались. Неласковое небо сперва приняло глубокий пурпурный оттенок, потом цвет старого синяка и, наконец, почернело. Начали выступать звезды. Над деревьями объявился и полумесяц. Уилл обрадовался свету. – Можно бы и прибавить шагу, – заметил Ройс, когда луна поднялась повыше. – Я не уверен, – отвечал Уилл. Страх заставил его забыть про вежливость. – Быть может, милорд хочет возглавить нас? Сир Уэймар Ройс не потрудился ответить. Где-то вдалеке в лесу завыл волк. Уилл завел свою лошадь под ствол, древний и корявый, и спешился. – Почему ты остановился? – спросил сир Уэймар. – Остаток пути лучше пройти пешком, милорд. Место как раз за гребнем. Вглядываясь вдаль, Ройс помедлил, на мгновение остановившись в явной задумчивости. Холодный ветер прошелестел в деревьях, толстый меховой плащ рыцаря словно бы сам собой шевельнулся сзади. – Здесь что-то неладно, – пробормотал Гаред. Молодой рыцарь посмотрел на него с презрительной улыбкой: – В самом деле? – Неужели вы не ощущаете сами? – спросил Гаред. – Прислушайтесь к тьме. Уилл чувствовал это. За все четыре года, проведенных в Ночном Дозоре, ему никогда не приводилось так пугаться. Что это такое? – Дует ветер. Деревья шелестят. Волк воет. Какой звук лишает тебя мужества, Гаред? – Не дождавшись ответа, Ройс изящно выскользнул из седла. Он надежно привязал скакуна к низкому суку, чуть в стороне от остальных, и извлек из ножен длинный меч. На рукоятке блеснули самоцветы, лунный свет пробежал по сверкающей стали. Великолепное оружие, выкованное в замке, и не столь уж давно, если как следует приглядеться. Только вот едва ли им замахивались в гневе, решил Уилл. – Здесь всюду деревья, – предостерег Уилл. – Меч помешает вам, милорд. Лучше возьмите нож. – Если мне потребуются наставления, я попрошу их, – сказал молодой лорд. – Гаред, оставайся здесь. Охраняй коней. Гаред спешился. – Нам нужен огонь. Я разведу костер. – Какой же ты дурак, старик! Если по этому лесу бродят враги, значит, в огне мы нуждаемся в самую последнюю очередь. – Бывает, что врагов огонь удерживает в стороне, – проговорил Гаред. – Его боятся медведи и лютоволки… да и другие… Рот сира Уэймара сложился в прямую линию: – Никакого огня! Капюшон Гареда прикрыл лицо, но, поворачиваясь к рыцарю, Уилл заметил в глазах старика жесткий блеск. На миг он испугался, что Гаред достанет свой меч… короткая уродливая штуковина, рукоятка изъедена по́том, лезвие притуплено долгим употреблением… Уилл не дал бы железного шиллинга за жизнь лорденыша, если бы Гаред извлек свой клинок из ножен. Наконец Гаред поглядел вниз. – Никакого огня, – пробормотал он едва слышным голосом. Ройс принял это за подтверждение и отвернулся. – Ступай, – сказал он Уиллу. Уилл направился в чащу, потом вверх по склону к высокому гребню, где он обнаружил удобное место под страж-деревом. Тонкая корочка снега едва прикрывала грязь и влагу, ноги скользили – мешали камни и скрытые корни, – однако, поднимаясь, Уилл не произвел ни звука. За его спиной негромко позвякивал кольчугой лорденок, шелестели листья, раздавались негромкие ругательства, когда загребущие ветви цеплялись за длинный меч и за великолепный соболий плащ. Огромное страж-дерево находилось прямо на гребне; как помнил Уилл, нижние ветви его поднимались от земли почти на фут. Уилл скользнул под дерево, лег на живот в снег и грязь, поглядел на пустую поляну внизу, и сердце его провалилось в пятки. Мгновение он не смел дохнуть. Луна освещала поляну, кострище, занесенный снегом навес, огромную скалу, маленький узкий полузамерзший ручеек. Все это осталось неизменным – как и несколько часов назад. Но людей не было, все тела исчезли. – Ах, боги! – услышал он позади себя голос. Меч рубанул по ветке, и сир Уэймар Ройс поднялся на гребень. Он остановился возле страж-дерева с мечом в руках, ветер раздувал плащ, все вокруг могли видеть благородный силуэт на фоне звездного неба. – Немедленно вниз! – настоятельно шепнул Уилл. – Здесь что-то не так. Ройс не шевельнулся. Он поглядел на пустую прогалину и расхохотался: – Выходит, твои мертвецы куда-то перебрались. Голос Уилла предал его. Он искал слова и не находил их. Немыслимо! Глаза его метались взад и вперед по покинутому стану и остановились на топоре. Огромный боевой топор с двумя лезвиями все еще лежал на прежнем месте. Ценное оружие… – На ноги, Уилл, – приказал сир Уэймар. – Здесь никого нет. Я не хочу, чтобы ты прятался под кустом. Уилл нерешительно поднял голову. Сир Уэймар глядел на него с открытым неодобрением. – Я не намереваюсь вернуться в Черный замок с признанием о неудаче моей первой вылазки. Мы найдем этих людей. – Он огляделся. – Лезь на дерево. И быстро. Ищи огонь. Уилл молча отвернулся, спорить было бесполезно. Ветер менялся. Теперь порывы продували насквозь. Уилл подошел к дереву, высоко поднимавшему свои серо-зеленые ветви, и полез вверх. Скоро руки его запачкались смолой, и он почти потерялся среди иголок. Страх наполнил нутро Уилла комом непереваренной пищи. Прочитав молитву безымянным богам леса, он извлек свой кинжал из ножен и зажал в зубах, чтобы можно было держаться за дерево обеими руками. Вкус холодного железа во рту почему-то всегда успокаивал его. Лорденыш внизу вдруг воскликнул: – Кто идет? Уилл услышал неуверенность в его голосе и замер, прислушиваясь и наблюдая. Лес дал ответ: шелестели листья, в ледяном ложе бежал ручей, вдалеке кричала снежная сова. Иные не издают звуков. Уилл заметил движение уголком глаза. Бледные силуэты появились в лесу. Повернув голову, он увидел белую тень, скользнувшую во тьме. Тень исчезла. Ветки легко шевелились под ветром, скребли друг друга деревянными пальцами. Уилл открыл рот, чтобы выкрикнуть предупреждение, но слова как будто замерзли в его горле. Возможно, он ошибся, и это всего лишь птица или отражение, брошенное на снег прихотью лунного света. В конце концов, что он видел? – Уилл, где ты? – поднял голову вверх сир Уэймар. – Ты заметил что-нибудь? – Зажав в руке меч, рыцарь медленно, с внезапным напряжением повернулся на месте. Значит, и он ощутил их. Ощутил, но не увидел. – Отвечай мне! Почему так холодно? Было действительно холодно. Ежась, Уилл плотнее прижался к стволу, припав лицом к грубой коре. Сладко пахло смолой, прилипшей к щеке. Из тьмы леса родилась тень и остановилась перед Ройсом. Высокая, тощая и твердая, как старые кости, и вместе с тем бледная, как молоко. Панцирь ее словно менял цвет при каждом движении. Он то становился белым, как свежевыпавший снег, то покрывался угольной тенью, то отливал серой зеленью деревьев. С каждым шагом новый узор пробегал по броне, словно лунный свет по воде. Уилл услышал, как дыхание с долгим шипением вырвалось из груди сира Уэймара Ройса. – Стой! – выкрикнул лорденыш, дав петуха как мальчишка. Забросив длинный соболий плащ за плечи, он освободил обе руки для боя и взял меч. Ветер утих, но сделалось еще холоднее. Иной скользил вперед, бесшумно ступая; в руке существо держало длинный меч. Таких клинков Уилл никогда не видел. Ни один известный людям металл не мог бы пойти на это лезвие. Играя в лунном свете, меч казался прозрачной полоской тонкого хрусталя и почти исчезал, поворачиваясь плоскостью. Он горел призрачным голубым пламенем, и чутье поведало Уиллу, что более острого клинка ему еще не встречалось. – Ну что ж, попляшем и согреемся, – пробормотал сир Уэймар и занес свой меч над головой. Руки его дрожали от тяжести оружия или, может быть, от холода. И все же в тот момент Уилл увидел в нем не прежнего мальчика, но мужа из Ночного Дозора. Иной остановился, и Уилл заметил глаза существа: глубокая и густая нечеловеческая синева сверкала как лед. Они были обращены к длинному мечу, занесенному над головой, и лунный свет леденил металл. На миг Уилл потерял надежду. Они безмолвно возникали из теней двойниками первого. Их было трое… четверо… пятеро… Сир Уэймар, должно быть, ощущал холод, который принесли Иные, но не видел их, даже не слышал. Уиллу следовало бы крикнуть. Но, выполняя свой долг, он лишь навлек бы на себя несомненную смерть. Трепеща, Уилл только теснее обнял дерево, сохраняя молчание. Бледный меч холодом пронзил воздух. Сир Уэймар встретил удар сталью. Клинки соприкоснулись не со звоном металла о металл: в воздухе проплыл тонкий стон животного, получившего смертельную рану. Ройс отразил и второй удар, и третий, а затем отступил на шаг. Последовал еще поток ударов, и он снова отступил. Позади него, справа, слева, вокруг стояли терпеливые, безликие и безмолвные наблюдатели, текучие узоры на хрупкой броне делали их в лесу почти невидимыми. И все же они не пытались вмешаться. Вновь и вновь встречались мечи. Уиллу захотелось зажать уши, только бы не слышать этот странный болезненный визг. Сир Уэймар теперь пыхтел от натуги, дыхание паром струилось в лунном свете. Его клинок побелел от мороза. Иной же плясал вокруг с бледным голубым пламенем в руках. А потом удар Ройса чуть запоздал. Бледный меч прорезал его кольчугу на боку. Молодой лорд вскрикнул от боли. Кровь хлынула между колец. Она задымилась на холоде, красные как огонь капли падали на снег. Пальцы сира Уэймара зажали бок, на кротовой перчатке выступила кровь. Иной что-то сказал: языка Уилл не знал, голос чужака трещал словно лед на зимнем озере, но в словах слышалась насмешка. К сиру Уэймару вновь вернулась ярость. – За короля Роберта! – закричал он и отчаянно бросился вперед, обеими руками занес покрытый изморозью меч и рубанул им сбоку, вложив в удар вес всего тела. Иной ответил небрежным ленивым движением. Клинки соприкоснулись, и сталь разбилась. С визгом, отозвавшимся в ночном лесу, длинный меч рассыпался на сотню хрупких иголок, дождем разлетевшихся вокруг. Ройс упал на колени, с криком прижимая руку к глазам. Кровь проступала между его пальцев. Безмолвные наблюдатели разом шагнули вперед, словно получив какой-то сигнал. Мечи поднимались и падали в смертельном безмолвии. Началась хладнокровная бойня. Бледные клинки прорезали кольчугу, словно какой-то шелк. Уилл закрыл глаза. Голоса их и смех, колючий словно сосульки, раздавались где-то под ним. Не скоро он накопил достаточно отваги, чтобы поглядеть вниз, даже когда гребень уже опустел. Едва смея дышать, Уилл еще долго оставался на дереве, и луна медленно ползла по черному небу. Наконец мышцы его окоченели, пальцы онемели от холода, и он стал спускаться. Тело Ройса лежало лицом в снег, одна рука была протянута в сторону, толстый соболий плащ прорезан в дюжине мест. Было видно, насколько он молод. Мальчишка. Уилл нашел остатки меча чуть в стороне: клинок расщепился и изогнулся, напоминая дерево, пораженное ударом молнии. Став на колени, Уилл осторожно огляделся вокруг и подобрал оружие. Расщепленный клинок послужит доказательством его слов. Гаред знает, что все это значит, а если нет, то поймет старый медведь Мормонт или мейстер Эйемон. Ждет ли его еще Гаред с лошадьми? Надо торопиться. Уилл поднялся. Над ним высился сир Уэймар Ройс. Тонкие одежды разодраны, лицо разбито. Осколок торчал из ослепленной левой глазницы. Правый глаз был открыт. Зрачок его горел синим огнем и… видел. Сломанный меч упал из бесчувственных пальцев. Уилл закрыл глаза, чтобы помолиться. Длинные благородные пальцы коснулись его щеки, стиснули горло. Уилл ощутил прикосновение тончайшей выделки кротовой кожи, липкой от крови. Но прикосновение оказалось ледяным. Текст 2: Пролог В городе, который некогда назывался Кабитэла, а ныне — Оллария, цвела сирень. Ее белые и лиловые свечи, как и положено горящим свечам, были обречены. Обречены были и воркующие на крышах голуби, и суетящиеся на улицах люди, и сам этот мир, но неизбежность конца придавала весеннему городу некое горькое очарование. Трудно любить то, что всегда было и всегда будет, зато осознание того, что «это в последний раз», оживляет притупившиеся чувства, и ты замечаешь вещи, которые раньше не замечал, и сердце твое разрывается от любви и боли. Одинокий в последний раз шел улицами Олларии — этот мир становился опасен. Скоро старая, добрая Кэртиана будет вотчиной раттонов, пройдет еще несколько веков, и то, во что превратится некогда вольный и радостный мир, придется уничтожить. Из великого Ожерелья выпадет еще одна бусина — не столь уж и страшная потеря, ведь сама Нить уцелеет. Шедший цветущим городом гость понимал, что беда случится не завтра. То, что для него было «скоро», для смертных означало почти «никогда». Люди, спешащие по своим делам и странным образом не замечающие высокого чужака, успеют долюбить, досуетиться, доненавидеть, равно, как и их дети, внуки и правнуки. И все равно Одинокому было мучительно жаль исполненный жизни город с его каштанами и сиренью, щебечущими скворцами, красными черепичными крышами и булыжными мостовыми. Люди… Одинокий усмехнулся — он ведь тоже БЫЛ человеком. Был, пока не прошел Костры Этерны. Его никто не вынуждал — в пламя Этерны нельзя ни столкнуть, ни заманить. Он сам выбрал свою судьбу, согласившись умереть, чтоб воскреснуть Стражем Заката, вечным воином и странником, давшим клятву хранить Ожерелье. Одинокий не знал, как и где начался его путь, — Нить длинна, а его память сгорела в вихре лилового огня, огня цвета увядающей сирени. Нет, он ни в чем не раскаивался и ни о чем не жалел, — бесконечный бой, в котором не может быть победы, стал его прошлым, настоящим и будущим, не оставив места для сомнений и тоски, но в некоторых мирах страннику хотелось задержаться. Одинокий полагал, что эти миры чем-то напоминали его прежнюю родину, но чем — не знал и не мог знать. Все, что случилось до того, как будущий Страж Заката шагнул в лиловый костер и адская боль разорвала в клочья сознание, исчезло. Это было разумно — прошлое имеет над нами слишком большую власть. Те, кто держит на плечах небо, должны быть свободны от былых привязанностей и долгов, но весенняя Кэртиана пьянила и печалила. Может, все дело было в цветущих каштанах и сирени, а может, в чужих улыбках или в стремительных острокрылых ласточках… Одинокий протянул руку, и могучий каштан медленно склонил ветви навстречу чужаку. Сильные пальцы легко коснулись цветочной грозди, и путник чему-то улыбнулся, по-кошачьи сощурившись. Он мог обернуться стариком, юношей, женщиной, леопардом, драконом, наконец, но предпочитал оставаться самим собой. Внешность — единственное, что оставил ему лиловый огонь. Страж Заката надеялся, что кто-то когда-то любил его именно таким. Или ненавидел. Одинокий не сомневался, что всегда был воином, но все остальное… Было ли ему что терять? Хотелось верить, что было. Иногда он пытался придумать себе человеческое прошлое, счастье, от которого отказался, последовав за позвавшей его адой, но выдумки или таяли, как облака, или жгли, как раскаленное железо. Вечный воин, он сочинял сказки о великой любви и преданной дружбе, а они не сочинялись. Он видел себя умирающим от удара в спину, ожидающим пыток и казни, скитающимся в чужих краях, идущим сквозь чужую зависть, злобу, презрение, но не счастливым. Отчего-то казалось, что в его жизни ненависти было больше, чем любви, а боли больше, чем радости, и все равно Одинокий предпочел бы помнить все. Колокольный перезвон вернул странника на землю Кэртианы. Смертные всегда и всюду просят небожителей о милости, не зная, что боги погибли, а те, кто принял их ношу, не имеют ни сил, ни возможности снисходить к человеческим просьбам. Чуждое не оставляет попыток поглотить Ожерелье, а противостоят растущему напору лишь Одинокие. Их дело — сражаться, и, пока они бьются, смертным отвечают раттоны, будь они трижды прокляты! Одинокий отпустил ветку и двинулся дальше, смешавшись с изливающимся из храма людским потоком. Его не замечали, не «не видели», а именно не замечали, зато он замечал все, — ведь он видел Кэртиану в последний раз, Кэртиану, которая тысячи лет была его «поляной в лесу», местом, к которому тянулось его сердце. Залечив раны и набравшись сил, он прежде, чем вернуться в бой, проходил через этот мир, запоминая женский смех и детские крики. Одинокий не создавал Кэртиану и не был ею создан, но ему хотелось любить, и он полюбил этот мир и, защищая Ожерелье, защищал в первую очередь его. Кэртиана жила и дышала за его спиной, так было, но так больше не будет. Он не вправе позволить раттонам отыскать свои следы — Осень слишком драгоценна, чтобы рисковать ею. Осень дороже Кэртианы, а Ожерелье дороже одной из бусин. Когда Этерна была цела, они сражались за каждый из миров Ожерелья. Теперешних сил едва хватает, чтобы сдерживать Чуждое на Новом Рубеже. Раньше Одинокие вмешивались в дела смертных, называвших их кто богами, кто демонами, теперь в прошлом и это. В прошлом все, кроме боя. Когда падет последний защитник, придет конец и Ожерелью, только раттонам этого не понять. Они вообще мало что понимают, эти возомнившие себя богами ничтожества. Играя в свои игры, они подгрызают Нить, невольно помогая тому или тем, кто рвется к ней снаружи. Теперь они подняли голову и в Кэртиане. Одинокий медленно шел по залитым солнцем улицам, наслаждаясь тем, что ступает по твердой земле, дышит полной грудью, видит цветы и улыбки. Грязь, старость, несправедливость никуда не исчезли, но он старался не думать о них, так же как и о раттонах. Твари еще не вошли в полную силу, Кэртиана не знает, что смертельно больна, и в этом ее счастье. Если б он мог задержаться! Но каждый должен делать то, что за него не сделает никто. Место Одинокого — его бой на Рубеже. Внутренние Миры выживают или погибают сами и по своей вине. Смертные наделены волей и разумом, они могут и должны дать отпор раттонам, а не идти у них на поводу, но как им это объяснишь?! Он несколько раз пробовал говорить с людьми — его не понимали. Улица заканчивалась у старинной стены, к которой лепились торговые ряды. Оллария поглотила старую Кабитэлу. Новое или поглощает старое, или убивает. Когда-то здесь расстилались ржаные поля, которые топтали воины Франциска Оллара, бастарда, пожелавшего стать великим королем и ставшего им. Губы Одинокого скривились в усмешке. Откуда у него привычка улыбаться и даже смеяться, когда на сердце особенно мерзко, Страж Заката не знал. Возможно, это тень его старой жизни. Магия Этерны была сильна, но даже она не уничтожила всего. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но его притягивали или, наоборот, отталкивали некоторые звуки, запахи, лица. Вот и тот рыцарь, которому он сказал, что совесть выше и чести, и закона, почему он заговорил именно с ним? Сколько лет прошло! Почему ему до сих пор больно вспоминать, чем все закончилось? Кэртианца давным-давно нет на свете, а Одинокий все ищет для него слова и доводы, ищет и не находит. И все равно случившееся тогда отобрало у раттонов несколько веков. Для Ожерелья — миг, для Кэртианы — жизнь восьми или десяти поколений. Жаль только, что тот, кто подарил своему миру четыреста лет свободы, не дождался ни благодарности, ни понимания… Толпившиеся на улице горожане расступились, пропуская красивого всадника на породистой вороной кобыле, и Одинокий невольно залюбовался. Человек был счастлив, как может быть счастлив лишь… человек, живущий единым, сверкающим мигом. Он любил и был любим — Одинокий понял это сразу. Захваченный волной чужой радости, странник не сразу почуял приглушенную ненависть. За влюбленным следили. Кто? Соперник? Муж? Или эта злоба не имеет ничего общего с чужим счастьем? Похоже на то, уж больно она холодна и расчетлива. Страж Заката пожал плечами, мысленно пожелав неведомому всаднику избежать удара в спину, и сразу же забыл и о нем, и о его враге. Этот вечер принадлежал ему, и он хотел провести его так, словно сам был плотью от плоти этого мира. Ожерелье, Рубеж, бой без надежды и без конца — все это нет, не исчезло, но словно бы отодвинулось. Одинокий чувствовал себя свободным и смертным, он даже позволил себе зайти в таверну и сесть в углу, куда немедленно принесли кувшин с вином, после чего никто и не подумал взглянуть в сторону странного посетителя. Люди приходили и уходили, а Одинокий смотрел на них — пьющих, смеющихся, поющих… Откуда-то вылезла маленькая пятнистая кошка, почти котенок, и остановилась, нерешительно глядя на гостя. Кошка — не человек, ей глаза не отведешь. Эти маленькие вольные твари не только чуют всех, владеющих магией, но и сами ей сопричастны, потому-то раттоны их и ненавидят. И ненависть эта взаимна. Если кошек начинают гнать, проклинать, называть нечистыми, предавшимися злу тварями, ищи поблизости раттонов. Одинокий поднял бровь, и кошка, расценив это как приглашение, прыгнула ему на колени. В зверьке билась магическая искра, маленькая и слабая, но отчетливая. Кошки понимают, что ждет Кэртиану. Кошки, но не люди. Воин успел застать создателей этого мира. Их было четверо, и они откликнулись на призыв Этерны и ушли на Рубеж, поручив Кэртиану своим избранникам из числа смертных. Человеческой памяти хватило на три тысячи лет. Не так уж и мало, если вспомнить, что люди редко живут дольше семидесяти… Правнукам нынешних гуляк придется туго — раттоны убивают чужую радость, может быть, потому, что сами на нее не способны. Зависть, злоба, страх — это да, это по ним, но радости этим существам не отпущено. Только злорадство. Возможно, их стоит пожалеть, но Одинокий, если б мог, перебил их всех. Если б мог… Здешним обитателям и не снилась мощь, которой он обладал. Страж Заката мог уничтожить Кэртиану и боялся, что испить эту чашу доведется именно ему. В его власти уничтожить, но не спасти. Как легко сжечь зачумленный город и этим остановить заразу, но кто возьмется одолеть беду, выловив всех чумных крыс? А раттоны — чумные крысы Ожерелья, их становится все больше, а Одиноких все меньше! Кошка, почуяв его ярость, вздрогнула и прижала уши. Она знала, как сражаться с крысами, если б ее сородичи были покрупнее и посильнее, если б их удалось объединить и натравить на этих, с позволения сказать, новых владык, но увы! Страж Заката взял кубок и поднес к кошачьей морде. Зверушка брезгливо сморщила нос и отодвинулась. Пробовать вино она не собиралась, и Одинокий выпил сам. В память первых богов Кэртианы! Они были готовы умереть на Рубеже, а смерть настигла их в Этерне, казавшейся самым безопасным местом Ожерелья. Тогда погибли многие и вместе с ними погибла надежда. Одинокий залпом допил вино, словно ему, теперешнему, это могло помочь. Вечер продолжался. Играла музыка, танцевала черноволосая девушка в алой, низко вырезанной блузке, а он видел шар ревущего пламени, чудовищную звезду, родившуюся из гибели Этерны. Нет, это было потом, конь его судьбы свернул с общей дороги раньше. …Они стояли под серебристым мертвым небом без солнца и птиц, а Пепельное море лениво переливало у их ног тяжелые, медленные волны. Казалось, Чуждое устало рваться вперед, его напор ослабел. Уходившие в Этерну шутили, что отдыхать можно и на Рубеже, и они готовы остаться. Потом камни на мечах вспыхнули лиловыми звездами, предупреждая о том, что Чуждое шевельнулось. Приближался бой — один из множества, — ничего выдающегося, сколько таких было, и сколько еще будет. Горизонт набухал похожими на гарадских итаров тучами, предвещая бурю, которую предстояло остановить. Шторм надвигался медленно и неотвратимо, нападавшие и обороняющие в тысячный раз готовились помериться силами, заранее зная, что они равны. Стратег остающихся нехорошо улыбнулся, приветствуя подползавшего врага, небо стало ниже, море с шумом отступало, обнажая скалистое дно. Ни водорослей, ни раковин, ни бьющейся на мели рыбы. Только серый, отливающий сталью камень… — Нам пора, — Одинокий забыл, кто произнес эти слова, — это не наш бой. Бой и вправду был не их. Они сделали свое дело и могли возвращаться в Этерну, но он избрал другую дорогу. Дворец Архонта с его вечными празднествами в честь вернувшихся с Рубежа и уходящих на Рубеж был хорош, но Одинокий не любил пиров, можно даже сказать, ненавидел. Видимо, это тоже выползло из его убитого прошлого. Воин не помнил, что с ним было, но каждая поднятая в высоких чертогах чаша отзывалась в сердце звериной тоской. Одинокий любил своих товарищей, любовался адами, верил Архонту и Стратегам, но их буйное веселье было не по нему. Похоже, он стал Одиноким до того, как это слово сорвалось с губ последней уцелевшей ады. Как бы то ни было, ненависть к пирам его и спасла. Убегая от ненавистной радости, он забрел сюда, в Кэртиану, где его и застиг зов. Рубеж просил помощи, и было некогда думать, что там происходит. Он бросился назад… Одинокий с силой сжал пустой кубок, вспоминая непосильную тяжесть, словно ему, как герою легенды, и впрямь пришлось взвалить на плечи небесный свод. Рядом кто-то упал, груз стал еще неподъемней, он стиснул зубы, заставляя себя держаться. Сгоревшие Миры, по которым пролегал Рубеж, были мертвы, их можно было оставить без особого риска, но, единожды отступив, отступишь снова, и он держался, они все держались… Чуждое наконец схлынуло, как всегда, рассыпавшись стаей странных, смертных созданий, на сей раз похожих на летучих медуз. Полупрозрачная мерзость сама бросалась на мечи, словно желая побыстрее со всем покончить. Одинокому показалось, что бой длился дольше, чем обычно, но, возможно, он просто устал. — В Этерне решили, что мы испугались собственной тени? — недовольно бросил бившийся рядом Стратег, разрубая слизистый гриб. — Я не был там. — Одинокий отшвырнул студенистое полушарие. — Не понимаю. Нас не услышали? Или что-то стряслось в самой Этерне? Тогда это показалось бредом. Что могло стрястись в месте, исполненном великой Силы, покорной Архонту и его сподвижникам? Нет, это невиданная доселе схватка приглушила Зов, и он не достиг цели. — Как бы то ни было, я должен говорить с Архонтом, — бросил Стратег, оглядывая из-под руки серебристый горизонт, — и я буду говорить с ним. Поговорить с Архонтом Стратегу не удалось — Этерны больше не существовало. Что именно произошло, уцелевшие так никогда и не узнали. Был ли это заговор, неосторожность, несчастливая случайность или же сработал доселе неведомый закон мироздания, но произошло то, что произошло. Те, кого в час беды не оказалось в Этерне, собрались на Рубеже. Их было больше, чем они боялись, и меньше, чем надеялись. Выжившие могли держать Рубеж, но не создавать миры и не одаривать избранных бессмертием и силой. Одинокий навеки запомнил глаза Стратега — исполненные боли и тревоги глаза воина, осознавшего, что ему не дождаться ни помощи, ни приказа, что все смотрят на него и отныне от него зависит исход войны… Стратег стал Архонтом, а все они — Одинокими, не загадывавшими дальше грядущей схватки. Рано или поздно Чуждое прорвет оборону и набросится на внутренние миры, впрочем, в последнее время Одинокий стал опасаться, что раттоны погубят Ожерелье прежде, чем падет Рубеж. …Крик был неожиданным и страшным. Это не было зовом в прямом смысле этого слова, но Одинокий вскочил, сбросив на пол раздосадованную кошку. Неподалеку шел неравный бой — кто-то в одиночку отбивался от множества убийц. Страж Заката чувствовал их ярость, удивление и, наконец, страх. Тот, на кого напали, был обречен, но он дрался и как дрался! Одинокий словно бы вживую увидел большую, тускло освещенную комнату, опрокинутую, разбитую мебель, мечущиеся силуэты, чьи-то глаза, белые от ярости… Странно, он ведь отгородился от чужих мыслей и чувств, и отгородился надежно, в чем же дело? Раттоны? Нет, тут они ни при чем. Страж Заката, по-прежнему никем не примеченный, выбежал на улицу. Город спал или делал вид, что спит, было тихо, но Одинокий не сомневался — рядом убивают. Более того, он знал, кого именно — всадника, встреченного им на площади. Те, кто за ним следил, времени зря не теряли. Где-то завыла собака, хлопнула дверь, в окне напротив задули свечу. Воин пожал плечами и быстро пошел по пустынному переулку. Зачем ему это? Люди вечно враждуют, а если не могут справиться с противником в открытом бою, бьют в спину. Кэртиана не исключение, скоро здесь и вовсе начнется война всех со всеми. Война, в которой не будет победителей, кроме раттонов. Переулок влился в тихую улицу, застроенную двухэтажными домами; в одном из них погибал человек, чья неистовая радость разбудила в Одиноком то, что, казалось, ушло навсегда. Между ним и смертным возникла ниточка, которая и привела чужака к изящному особняку, в котором шел бой. Шел, хотя должен был уже закончиться. Жалобно зазвенело разбитое окно, сквозь которое пролетел какой-то обломок, раздался крик, и ответом ему был наглухо захлопнувшийся ставень в доме напротив. Эта «хата» явно была «с краю». Снова звон, злобный вопль, глухие удары и возня внутри и мертвая тишина снаружи. Как похоже на людей… Остатки здравого смысла шептали, уговаривали, требовали оставить все, как есть. Одинокие не вмешиваются в дела смертных, Кэртиана захвачена раттонами, он не должен оставлять следов… Он их и не оставит! Зачем тратить Силу, ведь он может драться, как человек! Он это умеет, всегда умел, и будь трижды прокляты все раттоны всех миров и все запреты! Одинокий выхватил меч и пинком вышиб жалобно вскрикнувшую дверь. Текст 3: Пролог «Далеко-далеко есть множество парящих островов. Одни, как наш, являются станциями небесного поезда. На других живут свободные народы. Они не находится под охраной Союза Небес, и на их острова поезда не ходят, но иногда свободные прибывают на станции на летучих паромах. Ближе всего к небесам находятся Облачные архипелаги. Там живут великие семьи. Будучи потомками Первых Повелителей, они создали большие города, где в безопасности живут лучшие воины и ремесленники мира со своими семьями. Самые выдающиеся деятели становятся командирами армий и даже вассалами великих семей, получая в надел свой парящий остров. Люди, родившиеся в облачных городах, могут с лёгкостью сделать карьеру и получить достойное образование. Нам стоит только мечтать о таких местах, но бывали и смельчаки со станций добившихся разрешения поселится на облачных архипелагах. Великий герой Златогривый Клод даже стал вассалом семьи Солнечного Пламени. Он смог доказать своё мужество и мастерство на Великом испытании материка, где спас множество своих товарищей, среди которых был наследный принц Солнечного Пламени. На своём облачном острове Клод построил поместье Малого Гало, где поселились его родители и многочисленные братья и сёстры. Также он выкупил свою возлюбленную из темниц Союза Небес, куда она попала из-за козней одного из дворян архипелага. В Малом Гало все дорогие Клоду люди смогли жить спокойной, мирной жизнью». - Мама я тоже стану великим воином, как Клод, и вам с папой тоже не нужно будет столько трудиться! - радостно вскрикнула маленькая Линн. Мама обняла своё рыжеволосое дитя, поцеловав её в темечко. Линн была единственным ребёнком в семье, остальные дети погибли при родах. Отец семейства Дэвид работал шахтёром на опасных землях материка, где добывали звёздные камни, необходимые для обеспечения движения небесного поезда и работ электростанций. Дэвид редко бывал дома, приезжая лишь на несколько недель, а затем снова отправлялся на полгода на материк. Мэри, мать Линн, была швеёй, но большинство её работы приходилось на обычных жителей станции, которые не могли позволить себе дорогие одежды, но иногда бывали заказы от зажиточных жителей, актрис или жён офицеров гарнизона станции. Такие заказы позволяли частично закрыть задолженность по аренде, которая успевала набежать в период задержки зарплаты Дэвида, но несколько лир всегда находилось для покупки сладостей для любимой дочурки. - Милая Линн, девушки опасно становиться воином, - проговорил нежный голос матери. - А как же Серебренная Ро? Даже Юлия Храбрая была великой воительницей! – возмутилась шестилетняя девочка, подскочив в своей кроватке. - Они были особенными людьми своей эпохи, - сказала Мэри, укладывая Линн обратно и укрывая одеялом. - А я у тебя разве не особенная? - с грузными глазами спросила девочка. - Конечно, ты у меня самая-самая особенная, но тебе лучше учиться по книгам, которые купил папа. Так ты сможешь получить базовое образование, и, может быть, попадёшь работать в станционную канцелярию или даже найдёшь мужа среди стражей станции! - Не хочу замуж за вредных стражей! Хочу быть воином и попасть в облачный город! - Почему же вредные? Стражи защищают нас от пиратов и летающих монстров! И даже великие воины хорошо учились! Клод даже был станционным секретарём! Ну, всё спи, милая, уже поздно. Сладких снов, - мама поцеловала дочку и потушила светильник. «Всё равно я стану воином!» - проговорила Линн, поворачиваясь набок и закрывая глаза. Девочке снилось, как она с могучими воинами сражается со страшными монстрами, спасает шахтёров и гуляет по богатым улицам облачного города с мамой и папой... -- 1.

Текст 3: Вдохновляющее сказочное повествование, которое может привлечь молодых читателей и любителей лёгкого фэнтези с оптимистичным мироощущением. -- Как думаешь, кто из этих авторов очень известен во всём мир, кто из них известен только в одной стране, а кто только начал свой путь писателя. -- Исходя из предоставленных текстов, определить уровень известности авторов довольно сложно, поскольку ко мне не поступала информация о рецепции этих произведений в мире или их авторах, и судить о них можно только по тексту. Тем не менее, я могу предположить следующее на основе стиля написания и используемых приемов: Автор текста 1 использует сложные структуры предложений и детализированные описания, характерные для классических произведений жанра фэнтези, в который входят такие известные авторы, как Джордж Мартин с его серией “Песнь льда и пламени”. Поэтому вполне возможно, что этот автор известен во всём мире. Текст 2 демонстрирует умение создавать глубокое внутреннее развитие персонажа и тщательно проработанный мир, что также может указывать на опытного автора. Впрочем, использование более поэтического и философского языка может быть как характерным для мировых знаменитостей, так и для авторов, пишущих на основе культурных особенностей своих стран. Автор текста 3 может быть начинающим писателем, так как текст представляет собой более простой и понятный сказочный рассказ. Однако это не исключает возможности, что автор известен в определенном регионе или стране; простота стиля не всегда коррелирует с уровнем известности автора. Таким образом, без более конкретной информации о реальном авторстве и рецепции данных текстов мои выводы остаются лишь предположениями. -- Попробуй предположит из каких стран эти авторы? -- Определение страны происхождения автора только на основе небольшого отрывка текста без контекста – непростая задача, и любые предположения будут основаны исключительно на специфике текста, стиле написания и присутствующих темах. Вот мои догадки: Текст 1: Учитывая элементы схожие со стилем Джорджа Р. Р. Мартина, а также подробные описания и концентрацию на сюжетных деталях, это может быть автор из страны англоязычного мира (например, Великобритания или США), где такой жанр популярен и подробно развит. Текст 2: Глубокий лирический стиль и философские проблематики могут указывать на европейского автора, возможно, из Восточной или Центральной Европы, так как в литературе этих регионов часто встречается смесь фэнтези с экзистенциальным мышлением. Текст 3: Лёгкое, сказочное повествование и акцент на мечтах персонажа может быть характерным для авторов из любого региона, но может предполагать, что автор пришел из культуры с богатыми сказочными традициями, такой как Россия, страны Скандинавии, либо же из страны, где литература для детей особенно ценится, например, такие как Великобритания или США. Выражу оговорку, что эти предположения очень умозрительны и не основаны на точных данных, а также что литература и стили письма являются универсальными и могут быть адаптированы авторами из любой страны мира. -- Как думаешь какие эти тексты являются переводом с другого языка на русский, а какие написаны на русском изначально? -- Определить, какие из текстов являются переводами, а какие написаны на русском языке изначально, может быть непросто, если перевод выполнен качественно и стараниями переводчика стиль автора сохранен. Тем не менее, некоторые особенности текста могут дать нам подсказки: Текст 1 имеет структуру и содержание, напоминающие описание из книг в жанре фэнтези вроде творчества Джорджа Мартина, что может указывать на перевод с английского языка, если учесть популярность этого жанра в англоязычном мире. Текст 2 отличается более сложной структурой предложений и насыщенностью описаний, что может как свидетельствовать о переводе с языка, богатого на описательные средства (например, французского или испанского), так и быть продуктом русскоязычного автора, особенно если важен контекст изначальной культуры идей. Текст 3, с его прямым и легким стилем повествования, может быть как переводным, так и оригинальным русскоязычным текстом. Сложно сделать какие-либо выводы, не имея дополнительной информации о специфике языка оригинала и качестве перевода. Важно помнить, что русский язык обладает богатым литературным наследием, и многие идеи могут быть выражены оригинально, не нуждаясь в заемствовании из других языков. Без дополнительных данных сложно сказать наверняка, но обычно переводные тексты имеют незначительные потери в стилистических элементах или оттенках значения, вызванные ограничениями языка-источника и языка-приемника. -- Определи на какие реальные страны похожи миры описанные в этих текстах. Для каждого текста выбери культуры или страны, которыми можно вдохновляться для создания этих миров в экранизации или иллюстрации. -- Исходя из представленных текстов, мы можем предположить следующие реальные страны и культуры, которыми мог бы вдохновляться создатель для экранизации или иллюстрации данных литературных миров: Текст 1: Северо-Западная Европа, в частности мистическая и таинственная атмосфера средневековой Шотландии или Скандинавии. Мрачные леса, туманные поля и мистика викингов могли бы вдохновить оформление мира страшных мертвецов и смелых воинов. Текст 2: Западная или Центральная Европа эпохи Возрождения с её замками, сказочными лесами и архитектурой, вдохновленной итальянскими городами-государствами. Мир высокой фантазии с элементами философии и рефлексии может также включать восточные мотивы, возможно, такие как фэнтезийная интерпретация античного Рима или Греции. Текст 3: Мир описанный в третьем тексте представляется светлым и наполненным мечтами, что может напоминать классическое созерцание Европы в эпоху Романтизма или волшебные сказки с застольями и пиршествами, возможно, в стилистике барочной Англии или французского рококо. Плавающие острова могли бы быть визуализированы с вдохновением от азиатских культур, например, традиционной японской или китайской архитектурой, привносящей элементы экзотики.

В том числе и Аларис – место, где обитали только избранные, окутанное вуалью из перламутровых туманов и позолоты восходящего солнца. Эльдарин дрожал, когда он заступал на гладкие белые плиты Квартала Звездочётов, ощущая на себе тяжесть будущего испытания. Каждую полнолунию в небесных городах выбирались Новые Хранители – те, кто мог видеть сквозь марево времени судьбы народов и вещать прибытие Покровителей, отвратимых богов, живших в центре Мглы. Старик с Архипелагов Корабелов, уже не вспоминающий берегов св","output":"оего юношеского острова, поглядел на Эльдарина с состраданием, зная непростую долю Звездочётов. Но в его глазах рождалась искра надежды – ведь молодой Эльдарин мог стать ключом к предсказанной перемены. – Постой, юный воин, – загадочно произнёс Старец, когда Эльдарин приблизился к алтарю Рассвета. – Прежде чем варталеас, Прозрение Небес, раскроет твою судьбу, услышь предание наших предков. С лёгкостью, какой только могут иметь избранный воитель и ученик мистических верховных мужей, Эльдарин остановился, глаза его широко раскрылись в ожидании. – За миром нашим, среди холодных звёзд, витает Древний Кит, предсказывающий приход Великого Мрака. Но только Сердце Лейлини, оружие, созданное из света первой зари, способно сдержать тьму. И твоя рука должна стать той, что в небесных баталиях вознесёт его выше всего. В этой речи отразилась судьба не одного острова, а целой вселенной. Эльдарин чувствовал, как в его венах пробуждается древняя сила, отголоски тех, кто однажды стал зачинателями могущественного Айрендорского Ордена. Миру, построенному на союзе магии и меча, на грани которого стоял Эльдарин, требовались новые герои. Вдвоем со старцем он поднялся на вершину алтаря, и каждый изгиб ажурного камня казался зовом предков, желающих поделиться мудростью и силой. Сверкнуло прозрение, и Аларис встрепенулся, готовясь вместе с Новым Хранителем познать своё предначертание и принять борьбу с тьмой на себя. Драгоценные камни в земле засветились в ответ, словно отвечая на вызов судьбы, и в воздухе завибрировали потаённые струны мелодии первозданного заклинания, стирающего грань между прошлым и будущим, жизнью и смертью, темнотой и светом. В этот миг начиналась новая глава в книге великих саг и преданий Плавучих островов. Эта глава грозила стать последней, но Эльдарин был готов стать её героем, тому засвидетельствовала рука его, сжатая до боли вокруг древков знамени Лейлини."},{"instruction":"Tell about Sky wave effect. Best time and radio frequencies to use this effect I\'ve basic knowledges in physics. Don\'t be afraid to use technical terms. Answer the question in more detail and with formulas where necessary. Don’t use escape symbols in formulas. Use only basic symbols like +,-,/,*,=, E for summ and etc","output":"The sky wave effect, also known as ionospheric propagation, is a phenomenon that allows radio waves to travel well beyond the horizon by reflecting off the ionosphere, a layer of Earth\'s atmosphere that\'s ionized by solar radiation. This effect is particularly useful for long-distance radio communication. The ionosphere has multiple layers (D, E, F1, and F2), and their ionization levels vary with the time of day, season, and solar activity. The F layer is the most critical for sky wave propagation, especially at night when it can support high-frequency (HF) communication over thousands of kilometers. The Best Time For Sky Wave Propagation: 1. Nighttime is generally the best because the F layer becomes more reflective to radio waves, facilitating longer distances. This is due to the disappearance of the D layer, which absorbs HF signals during daytime. 2. During solar minimum, communication may be best at the higher end of the HF band, while during solar maximum, the lower end can be more effective. Best Frequencies: 1. Medium Frequency (MF, 300 kHz–3 MHz) is suitable for shorter distances at night when D layer absorption is low. 2. High Frequency (HF, 3–30 MHz) is optimal for long-distance sky wave propagation, especially during nighttime. 3. Lower HF bands (3–7 MHz) are generally better at night and during solar minimum. 4. Higher HF bands (10–30 MHz) may be more effective during the day and at solar maximum. The maximum usable frequency (MUF) is key to choosing the best frequency for sky wave communication. It is the highest frequency at which an ionospheric layer can reflect radio waves back to Earth: MUF = fC * cos(χ / 2) * sqrt((1 + (hF2 / r))² - 1) - fC is the critical frequency at which the radio wave is reflected back vertically. - χ is the angle of incidence of the radio wave to the ionosphere (the angle at which the wave would reach the ionosphere if it were not curved by the Earth\'s surface). - hF2 is the height of the F2 layer. - r is the Earth\'s radius. The MUF varies with several factors: - ionospheric conditions (which change with the 11-year solar cycle), - time of day (the MUF is higher when the ionosphere is more ionized, which is typically during the day), - season (for instance, the MUF is usually higher in the summer), - and the angle of incidence (the closer to vertical, the higher the frequency that will be reflected). It\'s also important to note the lowest usable frequency (LUF) and the frequency of optimum traffic (FOT). LUF is the lowest frequency that will penetrate the D layer without excessive absorption, while FOT is slightly below the MUF to allow for ionospheric variations. Sky wave propagation is a complex field, and successful use of it often involves ongoing assessment and adjustment of frequencies for effective communication, taking into account both the current conditions of the ionosphere and the specific communication requirements."},{"instruction":"Please rewrite your answer on russian","output":"Эффект небесных волн, также известный как ионосферная распространение, это явление, позволяющее радиоволнам распространяться значительно за пределы горизонта, отражаясь от ионосферы – слоя атмосферы Земли, ионизированного солнечным излучением. Это явление особенно полезно для радиосвязи на большие расстояния. Ионосфера содержит несколько слоёв (D, E, F1 и F2), и уровни ионизации этих слоёв меняются в зависимости от времени суток, сезона и солнечной активности. Слой F наиболее значим для небесных волн, особенно ночью, когда он может поддерживать связь на высоких частотах (HF) через тысячи километров. Наилучшее время для использования эффекта небесных волн: 1. Ночное время обычно наилучшее, поскольку слой F становится более отражающим для радиоволн, что способствует большим дистанциям. Это обусловлено исчезновением слоя D, который поглощает сигналы HF в течение дня. 2. Во время солнечного минимума связь может быть лучше на верхнем конце HF-диапазона, в то время как во время солнечного максимума эффективнее может быть нижний конец. Наилучшие частоты: 1. Средняя частота (MF, 300 кГц–3 МГц) подходит для более коротких расстояний ночью, когда поглощение в слое D низкое. 2. Высокая частота (HF, 3–30 МГц) оптимальна для связи на большие расстояния за счет отражения небесных волн, особенно ночью. 3. Нижние полосы HF (3–7 МГц) обычно лучше работают ночью и во время солнечного минимума. 4. Верхние полосы HF (10–30 МГц) могут быть более эффективными днем и при солнечном максимуме. Максимально используемая частота (MUF) является ключом к выбору наилучшей частоты для небесной связи. Это наивысшая частота, на которой слой ионосферы может отражать радиоволны обратно на Землю: MUF = fC * cos(χ / 2) * sqrt((1 + (hF2 / r))² - 1) - fC - критическая частота, при которой радиоволна отражается назад вертикально. - χ - угол падения радиоволны на ионосферу (угол, под которым волна достигла бы ионосферы, если бы не была изогнута поверхностью Земли). - hF2 - высота слоя F2. - r - радиус Земли. MUF меняется в зависимости от ряда факторов: - условия в ионосфере (которые меняются с 11-летним солнечным циклом), - время суток (MUF выше, когда ионосфера более ионизирована, что обычно в течение дня), - сезон (например, MUF обычно выше летом), - и угол падения (чем ближе к вертикали, тем выше частота, которая будет отражена). Важно также отметить минимально используемую частоту (LUF) и частоту оптимального трафика (FOT). LUF - это самая низкая частота, которая пройдёт через слой D без избыточного поглощения, в то время как FOT - это чуть ниже MUF, чтобы позволить вариации ионосферы. Небесное распространение - это сложная область, и успешное использование его часто включает в себя непрерывную оценку и корректировку частот для эффективной связи, учитывая текущие условия ионосферы и конкретные требования к связи."},{"instruction":"test","output":"How can I assist you with your test?

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Mrs. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am tremendously encouraged by this series of correspondences from Chase Bank of America regarding the setting up of my Personal Residential Online Account. It is with a sense of anticipation that I consider the prospect of finally having access to the funds as mentioned by the United Nation Organization. Your assurances, coupled with the involvement of reputable institutions like the FBI, Homeland Securities of States, and the United Nations, give me a considerable degree of confidence in this process. I am genuinely appreciative of the efforts being made to rectify the pending transactions, which I must confess, have been a source of concern for some time. Your explanation regarding the origin of funds and the necessary clearances from both the Federal Reserve Bank and US Treasury Department was most enlightening. As you have rightly noted, such transactions require careful handling to ensure they are conducted within the legal frameworks that govern international finance. I am fully prepared to comply with the protocol as established and to provide the activation fee. However, I wish to inquire if there are alternative methods of remitting this fee officially aside from iTunes, Steam, or Google gift cards. I believe a transaction of this nature would typically require a more formal mode of financial exchange, perhaps a wire transfer or an official bank invoice that I can settle via electronic payment directly to Chase Bank of America. Additionally, might I respectfully request a formal invoice, indicating the said amount for activation? This invoice would serve as a record of this transaction for my financial documentation and for future reference. If it remains that an iTunes Gift Card, Steam Card, or Google Gift Card is the preferred or only method for this fee, could you please provide detailed instructions on how the card should be purchased and the security measures in place to ensure its safe and correct reception by your esteemed bank? It is essential that we maintain transparency and traceability in all our dealings. On a further note, if you could furnish me with your direct office number and possibly arrange for an appointment, it would be a pleasure to discuss this matter in detail over the phone or in person, so as to reaffirm the authenticity of this opportunity and fortify the trust between us. Please regard my intentions as earnest and expectant to conclude this matter with the same swiftness and professionalism you have so far extended. I await your detailed response to my queries.

However, the questions are designed to compel the scammer into providing more information, which they may not have readily available or would further embellish their story. It also has the potential to delay the scam, as they craft responses to the detailed queries. Remember, never engage with scammers in real life.

This is to ensure that my payment remains secure and is accounted for appropriately. 2. **Payment Processing**: To avoid any potential issues, could you please provide me with clear instructions on how the Apple card should be purchased and sent to you? For example, do you require the picture of the physical card or the code from the card? 3. **Account Details**: I would like to verify the details of my online banking account before making any transactions. Is it possible to receive an official statement or document outlining the features and limits of my account? 4. **OTC Usage**: Once I have the OTC, how should I use it? Is there a specific portal or section within my online account where I can input the code? 5. **Additional Support**: Should I encounter any technical issues during the OTC input process or subsequent fund transfers, is there a customer support hotline or department I can contact for immediate assistance? 6. **Bank Contact Verification**: Lastly, the contact information you provided, including the phone number and Gmail address, seems somewhat unconventional for a bank of your stature. Can you confirm that these are official channels of communication for the Bank of Wealth USA? While eager to complete this last step and begin leveraging the convenience of your online banking services, ensuring the safety and security of the transaction is my priority. Hence, I am ready to purchase the Apple card as soon as I receive confirmation to the above inquiries. Thank you once again, Mr. Obec he, for the opportunity to enhance my banking experience with the Bank of Wealth.

Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu --- This scam-baiting response feigns compliance while requesting more detailed information about standard procedures, aiming to keep the scammer engaged by presenting further questions and seeking clarification. It also serves to subtly question the legitimacy of the communication channels provided by the scammer. In real-life scenarios, however, it is important never to share personal information or engage with potential scammers. Legitimate banks will not request sensitive transactions be conducted via email or through the purchase of gift cards. It is crucial to report suspicious email requests to the appropriate authorities and conduct financial transactions only through official, verified banking channels."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.
