To find out how many percent were not 65 years of age or older, we need to subtract the number of people who were 65 years of age or older from the total number of people in the group: 100 - 20 = 80 So out of the 100 people in the group, 80 were not 65 years of age or older. To determine the percentage, we need to divide the number of people who were not 65 years of age or older by the total number of people in the group and then multiply by 100: 80 / 100 * 100 = 80% Therefore, 80% of the people in the group were not 65 years of age or older.

For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for nchannel devices and a lower current for pchannel devices.

The province with the lowest support rating was Quebec, which had a rating of 55%. This is likely due to ongoing debates about Quebec's status within Canada, including discussions about independence and the protection of the French language. Next on the list was Alberta, with a support rating of 62%. This may be due to concerns about the province's economic future and the impact of environmental regulations on the oil and gas industry. Saskatchewan had a support rating of 68%, which is relatively low compared to other provinces. This could be attributed to issues such as healthcare, education funding, and infrastructure development. Manitoba had a support rating of 70%, just making the cutoff for the 70% or lower category. This may be due to public concerns about crime rates, healthcare, and employment opportunities. It's important to note that support ratings can fluctuate over time and are affected by many factors, including political events, economic conditions, and social issues.

Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the realworld events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first half of the film, dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players (all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School) is less effective and probably a bit too long. Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without.

It depends on several factors, including how the group is defined and where the population is being counted. In terms of global population, the Italian ancestral group is larger than the Irish. According to the CIA World Factbook, Italy has a population of just over 60 million people, while Ireland has a population of around 5 million. However, when it comes to the United States, the situation is a bit more complicated. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, there are approximately 33 million Americans who claim Irish ancestry, while there are around 17 million who claim Italian ancestry. It's worth noting that these numbers are based on self-reported ancestry, which means that people may identify with more than one ancestral group, and some may choose not to identify with any particular group at all. Additionally, these numbers are based on surveys and estimates, so they may not be entirely accurate. In terms of cultural influence and visibility, both the Irish and Italian ancestral groups have played significant roles in American history and society. From St. Patrick's Day parades to Italian-American heritage festivals, both groups have celebrated and preserved their cultural heritage in the United States. Ultimately, the question of which ancestral group is larger is somewhat subjective and dependent on context. While the Italian ancestral group is larger in terms of global population, the Irish have a larger presence in the United States.

Navarrette says Obama acts without Congress only on issues important to him. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In an attempt to stop the deportations of undocumented immigrants, a heckler urged former President Barack Obama to issue an executive order. However, Obama refused, saying that he did not have the authority to make law. Despite his statement, Obama has used executive orders before, including the creation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) without Congress' approval. Ruben Navarrette, a political analyst, noted that Obama only acted without Congress on issues that were important to him. This raises questions about the role of executive orders in the legislative process and the president's ability to bypass Congress. The creation of DACA was a controversial move that sparked debate on both sides of the political spectrum. Some argued that the executive order was a necessary step to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation and provide them with a path to citizenship. Others felt that it was an overreach of executive power and that the issue should have been addressed through the normal legislative process. Regardless of one's stance on the matter, Obama's use of executive orders brings up important questions about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government. Should the president be able to bypass Congress on issues that are important to them? And if so, where should the line be drawn? As the debate over immigration reform continues to rage on, it is important to consider these questions and to think about how executive orders fit into the broader context of our democracy. While they can be a useful tool for addressing pressing issues, they also have the potential to undermine the democratic process and bypass the will of the people.

Clip the tapestry into the clothespins.","output":"How to Hang a Tapestry Using Clothespins and Command Strips Hanging a tapestry is a great way to add texture and personality to your living space. However, the traditional method of framing or nailing can be challenging or damaging, especially for those renting or living in a temporary space. Fortunately, there are alternative ways to hang a tapestry, such as using clothespins and Command Strips. To start, determine the placement of the tapestry on the wall. Mark the two top corners of the tapestry using a pencil or masking tape. This will help you position the clothespins and Command Strips accurately. Next, select the clothespins you will use to hold the tapestry in place. Large or heavy tapestries may require stronger clothespins or multiple clips for support. It's also essential to choose clothespins that fit comfortably and securely between the lines of the tapestry. Decorative clothespins can add an extra touch of charm or color to your tapestry display. Once you've selected the clothespins, prepare the Command Strips. These adhesive strips can hold up to 16 pounds and are ideal for temporary décor solutions. Peel off the protective backing from each Command Strip and attach it to the back of the clothespin. Press firmly to ensure a secure bond. After attaching the Command Strips, position the clothespins on the marked spots on the wall. Hold onto the clothespin firmly for a few seconds to let the Command Strip adhere to the wall. If necessary, use a level or ruler to make sure the clothespins are straight and evenly spaced. Finally, it's time to clip the tapestry into the clothespins. Gently insert the fabric between the jaws of the clothespins and release slowly. Check to make sure the tapestry is level and evenly balanced between the two clothespins. You can adjust the position or tightness of the clothespins as necessary to get the desired effect. In conclusion, hanging a tapestry using clothespins and Command Strips is a versatile and easy DIY solution. This method allows you to transform the look of your room without damaging the walls or committing to a permanent display. With a little creativity, you can customize your tapestry display and showcase your unique style."},{"instruction":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? in its characterizations OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"Neutral."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve 5*y = 17*y 24 for y.

The EpiPen case also provides a safe place to store the device, making it easier to find in an emergency. Secondly, it is crucial to look through the viewing window of the EpiPen to ensure that the liquid within is clear and not discolored. If the liquid looks cloudy or has particles floating in it, it should not be used and a new device should be obtained. Thirdly, store your EpiPen in the right temperature. The device should be stored at room temperature between 68°F and 77°F (20°C to 25°C). Do not store it in a car, fridge, or freezer as extreme temperatures can cause the EpiPen to malfunction. Lastly, always check the expiration date of the EpiPen before use. The device should be replaced before the expiration date, as an expired EpiPen may not be effective in treating an allergic reaction. The expiration date is typically printed on the side of the device or on the packaging.

However, before choosing a design, it's essential to consider the location on your body where the tattoo will be placed. The placement of your tattoo can affect both the design and the overall look of your tattoo. To start, brainstorm a design that speaks to you. Look for imagery or symbols that represent significant events or values in your life. You can also draw inspiration from nature, culture, or art. Whatever design you choose, it's important to make sure it's something that you'll still love in the future. After selecting a design, you'll need to choose a location on your body. Think about whether this tattoo will be visible or if you'd prefer it to be hidden. Consider your job and your lifestyle, as some employers may not allow visible tattoos. It's also important to talk to your doctor before getting a tattoo, especially if you have any medical conditions or take any medications that could interfere with the healing process. They can provide recommendations on the best placement for your tattoo based on your specific health needs. In summary, when brainstorming a design for a tattoo, it's important to consider both the location on your body and potential health implications. Take your time to choose a design that speaks to you and a location that suits your lifestyle, and always consult with a medical professional before getting inked."},{"instruction":"dine out at many fine dining restaurants in the Valley and I have to say I had one of the WORST experiences dining at Noca.

The credit portion of the Financial crisis of 20072010 did not affect the Czech Republic much, mostly due to its stable banking sector which has learned its lessons during a smaller crisis in the late 1990s and became much more cautious. As a fraction of the GDP, the Czech public debt is among the smallest ones in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, unlike many other postcommunist countries, an overwhelming majority of the household debt over 99% is denominated in the local Czech currency.

These activities are not only illegal and unsafe but can also harm the reputation of the event and the individuals involved. Therefore, I strongly advise against arriving early for a concert with the intention of sneaking in without a proper ticket or pass. Instead, it's essential to plan ahead and purchase the ticket from an authorized vendor or through the official website. By doing so, not only do you ensure your entrance to the event, but you also support the performers and organizers. Attending a concert is a popular and exciting experience where people come together to enjoy live music and connect with others who share the same interests. However, it's crucial to respect the rules and regulations set by the event organizers, especially when it comes to security measures. By attempting to climb a fence or impersonate a roadie, individuals not only risk being caught and escorted out but also endanger themselves and others. Moreover, such actions can ruin the experience of the event for the legitimate ticket holders and create chaos and confusion among the crowd. Wearing adhesive wristbands or walking in with a large crowd may seem like a harmless strategy to enter a concert, but it's important to recognize that security personnel are trained to detect suspicious behavior and may take preventive measures to ensure the safety of the attendees. In conclusion, attending a concert should be a memorable and enjoyable experience for all involved. Instead of risking harm to oneself and others, it's essential to purchase a ticket or obtain the proper credentials from the event organizers.

Another way to save money is to know the cheapest times to fly.
