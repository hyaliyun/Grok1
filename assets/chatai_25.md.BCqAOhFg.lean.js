The video, which is nine minutes long, echoes a recent video of a similar procession of prisoners. The footage ends with a haunting shot of an elderly man's face, before cutting to black. The video has sparked outrage and condemnation from leaders around the world. The actions of those responsible for the video are not only inhumane and barbaric, but also a violation of international law. The prisoners are entitled to basic human rights and should not be subjected to such cruel and degrading treatment. The use of video propaganda by extremist groups is not a new phenomenon. However, this latest video takes the use of propaganda to a new level of depravity.

Among these priorities, minimizing stress levels and avoiding potential allergens are at the top of the list. To achieve these goals, there are a few simple steps that you can take to make your home a healthier environment. First and foremost, it's critical to reduce stress in your life as much as possible. This could mean practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, or simply taking time to engage in activities that you enjoy. By doing so, you can help to lower your body's levels of cortisol, a hormone that is released in response to stress. Another important step is to minimize your exposure to any known allergens. This may include dust, pet dander, or pollen from trees and plants. To accomplish this, it's a good idea to keep your home clean and well-maintained, particularly in areas where allergens are likely to collect. You may also want to invest in a high-quality air purifier to help filter out airborne allergens. It's also crucial to quit smoking and minimize how much alcohol you drink. Both smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are major contributors to poor health outcomes, particularly in relation to respiratory and cardiovascular health. By cutting back on these habits, you can reduce your risk of health problems and improve your overall quality of life. Finally, remember that small changes can add up to make a big difference.

However, he insists that he only clocks in when he believes that his presence is actually required. In his own words, ‘there is no point giving a speech to an all but empty chamber’. This admission has been met with some criticism from other parties, most notably the Liberal Democrats. They have openly questioned why Mr. Colman stood for election in the first place.

Of course, it’s important to remember that politicians of all colours have faced criticism over the years for their attendance records.

Some might argue that if he is only attending when he feels that his presence is strictly necessary, then he is not doing his job properly. So what is the solution to this issue? It’s unlikely that Mr. Colman will change his ways anytime soon.

Watch how light reflects from the sapphire.","output":"When considering purchasing a high-quality gemstone, there are a few key factors to look out for that can indicate the value and authenticity of the stone. One important aspect to pay attention to when evaluating gems is the presence of air bubbles within the stone. While these bubbles may not always be visible upon first inspection, it is worth taking the time to scrutinize the gem closely and check for any imperfections. The best way to check for air bubbles within a gem depends on the specific type of stone you are considering. For example, with a sapphire, you can use the scratch test to determine whether there are any bubbles present. Simply take a piece of glass and try to scratch the surface of the sapphire. If it leaves a mark, then the stone is not a genuine sapphire, and you should look elsewhere. If the stone remains unscathed, however, then you can be reasonably sure that it is an authentic sapphire. Another important factor to consider when evaluating gems is the way that light reflects off of them. With a sapphire, for instance, you can examine it closely and observe the way that light passes through the stone. A high-quality sapphire will be clear and free of any blemishes that could distort the way that light reflects off of it. Additionally, a genuine sapphire will have a unique color and clarity that distinguishes it from other gemstones. In conclusion, when considering purchasing a gemstone, it is essential to evaluate it based on certain key factors. Checking for air bubbles, using the scratch test, and examining the way that light reflects from the stone are all useful techniques that can help you determine the authenticity and value of the gem. Whether you are buying a sapphire, a diamond, or any other type of gemstone, taking the time to inspect the stone closely can help you make an informed decision and ensure that you are getting the best possible value for your money."},{"instruction":"What is also referred to as a horn of plenty?

Give them colostrum to start. Switch to milk. Create a feeding schedule.","output":"Article: Raising a calf can be a fun and rewarding experience for anyone interested in the process. However, it involves a lot of careful attention and commitment to ensure that the calf grows healthy and strong. One of the most crucial aspects of raising a calf is feeding - it is essential to give your calf the right nutrients at the right time. The first thing to do when you bring your calf home is to get calf bottles and nipples. Calf bottles are bigger than regular baby bottles and have a capacity of two to three quarts, while nipple sizes can vary depending on the calf's age or size. When choosing nipples, make sure that they are strong enough to withstand the calf's chewing and pulling. The next step is to give the calf colostrum to start. Colostrum is the first milk produced by the female cow after giving birth, and it contains high levels of antibodies that can help boost the calf's immunity. It is crucial to give the calf colostrum within the first 24 hours of life, as the calf's ability to absorb antibodies decreases rapidly after that. After the initial colostrum feeding, it is time to switch to milk. Calf milk replacers are readily available in the market, and it is essential to choose a high-quality brand that contains essential nutrients like protein, fat, and vitamins. When mixing the formula, ensure that you follow the instructions precisely and use the recommended proportion of powder to water. Creating a feeding schedule is also essential in raising a healthy calf. In the first few weeks, the calf would require frequent feedings - it is recommended to feed at least twice a day. Gradually, you can reduce the frequency as the calf grows older and their appetite increases.

Moscow soon forced the Communist Parties of France and Great Britain to adopt an antiwar position.

Thus, the various western Communist parties now had to oppose the war, and to vote against war credits.

The ICC has only completed a handful of cases since its establishment in 2002, including cases against high-profile figures such as former President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, and former Vice-President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jean-Pierre Bemba. However, the majority of those who directly commit crimes go unpunished. 2. In many cases, lower-level perpetrators such as foot soldiers, police officers, or junior officials are not prosecuted by the ICC. For example, in the case against al-Bashir, only five counts of crimes against humanity were brought against him, despite the widespread and systematic nature of the abuses committed. 3. According to Human Rights Watch, the ICC's focus on prosecuting group leaders can disincentivize individuals from coming forward to provide evidence against them, fearing retribution from the group's remaining members. This can make it harder to prosecute those who actually committed the crimes. 4. The ICC's jurisdiction is limited, as it can only investigate and prosecute individuals from states that have ratified the Rome Statute, and only for crimes committed after the treaty came into force for that particular state. This means that perpetrators of crimes that happened before 2002 or in non-member states are unlikely to face prosecution. Overall, while the ICC has played an important role in holding high-ranking individuals accountable for atrocities, there are limitations in its ability to prosecute all those responsible for such crimes."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to forget the basics that keep us healthy. Here are four simple but essential habits to adopt for a healthier life: 1. Get enough sleep. Sleep is essential for the body to rest and rejuvenate. It reduces stress levels, improves memory, and helps the body heal from diseases. Aim for around 7-9 hours of sleep each night to ensure your body gets the rest it needs. 2. Wash your hair regularly. Washing your hair not only keeps it looking clean but also removes any dirt or bacteria that may have accumulated on your scalp. It can also help to prevent dandruff and other scalp-related issues. Aim to wash your hair at least twice a week, or more frequently if you have a particularly oily scalp. 3. Eat well. A balanced diet is essential for overall health and wellbeing. Eating whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. Try to limit consumption of processed foods and sugar, which can cause health problems in the long term. 4. Get regular cardio exercise. Cardiovascular exercise is beneficial for heart health and can also help in weight loss, stress reduction, and improved sleep quality. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, such as jogging, cycling, or brisk walking. In summary, getting enough sleep, washing your hair regularly, eating well, and regular cardio exercise are all essential habits that contribute to a healthy lifestyle.

They believed that art should capture the emotions and experiences of real life, while also exploring the deeper meanings and symbolism behind those experiences.

While this is welcome news for those concerned about climate change, it comes with a price tag. The government will guarantee the price paid for power from these projects, pushing up electricity bills for homes and businesses. Despite concerns about rising prices, Mr Davey insists that the only way to keep prices down in the long-term is to invest in renewable energy. He argues that traditional fossil fuels will only become more expensive as they become scarcer, whereas renewable energy will become cheaper as it becomes more prevalent. Critics argue that the government is forcing consumers to pay for its green agenda, and that the true cost of renewables is being hidden in energy bills. The government counters by saying that the cost of energy would be even higher if it were not investing in renewables. Overall, the government's move towards renewable energy is a positive one, but it is important that they are transparent about the costs involved. Consumers have a right to know exactly how much they are paying for renewable energy, and whether there are cheaper alternatives available. In conclusion, while the guarantee of price paid for power from renewable energy projects will push up energy bills in the short-term, it is a necessary investment in the long-term future of the UK's energy infrastructure.

It was a devastating loss for the artist, who feared that the songs may never be heard again. However, the story took an unexpected turn seven years later when a German auto shop proprietor returned the stolen items after the singer made a plea on YouTube and offered a 1 million reward. The singer, whose identity was not disclosed in the news report, had been left heartbroken after the theft. The tracks were a culmination of years of hard work and dedication, and losing them was a severe setback. Despite efforts to recover the items, they remained missing for several years, until the German auto shop proprietor came forward with them. The proprietor claimed to have found the items in a storage room in his shop and recognized their value. After seeing the singer's plea on YouTube and hearing about the reward offered, he decided to return the items. However, it was not a straightforward process, as the singer alleged that the proprietor had reneged on the deal after he was unable to access the songs. The incident is a cautionary tale for artists and creatives who put years of work and dedication into their craft. It shows the importance of safeguarding their creations and being vigilant in protecting their intellectual property. While the singer eventually got his songs back, it was a long and arduous process that could have been avoided with better safeguards in place. This story also highlights the power of the internet and social media. The singer's plea on YouTube was seen by thousands of people, and it only took one person to recognize the value of the stolen items and return them.

In conclusion, the return of the stolen laptop and hard drive containing tracks by a famous singer is a powerful story that highlights the importance of safeguarding one's intellectual property.

These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution' of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including Hampshire County Council who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town.

He says Brietbart baited liberals but was not straightup conservative. He says his legacy was creating discussion outlets away from what he saw as smug media. Gillespie: His efforts weren't always pretty, but mediascape he grew was more interesting.","output":"Andrew Breitbart: Polarizing and Proud Nick Gillespie, editor-in-chief of Reason.com, recently reflected on the legacy of Andrew Breitbart, who passed away in 2012. Gillespie describes Breitbart as a polarizing figure, who relished in baiting liberals, but was not necessarily a straight-up conservative. Breitbart, according to Gillespie, was more interested in creating discussion outlets away from what he perceived as a smug media. Breitbart’s efforts were not always pretty, and his tactics often drew controversy. However, Gillespie argues that the mediascape that he grew was undeniably more interesting. Breitbart famously ran conservative news sites like Breitbart.com and Big Government, which were designed to counteract what he considered a biased mainstream media. Gillespie acknowledges that these sites were not necessarily known for their objective reporting, but he argues that they succeeded in creating a space where conservatives could share their views without feeling constantly attacked. Breitbart also made headlines for his role in several controversies, including the release of a heavily edited video of a speech by Shirley Sherrod, a former Agriculture Department employee. The video purportedly showed Sherrod making racist remarks, but it was later revealed to be heavily manipulated. Gillespie acknowledges that such incidents were not always ethical or even truthful, but he argues that they were part of Breitbart’s larger mission to challenge what he saw as an unfair media landscape. Gillespie notes that Breitbart’s willingness to challenge established media outlets is a legacy that lives on today. In recent years, many conservatives have become frustrated with what they see as a liberal bias in mainstream media, leading to the rise of alternative news sources like Fox News and Breitbart.com. While not everyone agrees with Breitbart’s tactics or agrees with his politics, Gillespie acknowledges that his willingness to shake up the status quo has had a lasting impact on the media landscape. In conclusion, Nick Gillespie believes that Andrew Breitbart’s legacy is one of polarizing but productive discourse. Breitbart’s ability to create discussion outlets outside of the mainstream media has irrevocably changed the way conservatives engage with the news. While his methods may not always have been pretty, there is no denying that the mediascape he helped create is more diverse and interesting than it was before."},{"instruction":"Concepts: food, search, zebra Write a sentence that includes all these words.","output":"I am going to search for some food while imagining a zebra running wildly."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: Many young adults experience anxiety and stress related to their academic performance in high school.

However, she was recently pictured at a riding event in her native Switzerland, where she was seen laughing and smiling. This has come as a relief to many, as just weeks ago experts had warned that Corinna was on the verge of making herself ill due to the constant worry about the future for her husband. Schumacher suffered severe head injuries while skiing in the French Alps and has been in a medically induced coma ever since. Despite the long road to recovery, there have been some positive signs.

Her mother initially claimed that the attack was a result of Mallory's sexual orientation. Mallory was beaten by Travis Hawkins, the brother of her then-girlfriend, Alex Hawkins. Travis Hawkins was charged with second-degree assault. However, Mallory's friends and family argue that the charges should be more severe, as the attack was not just an act of violence but a hate crime. Unfortunately, Alabama does not include sexual orientation as a bias offense, which limits the legal options of the prosecution. Mallory's story highlights the continuing issue of hate crimes in the LGBTQ+ community. It is unacceptable for a person to be assaulted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Hate crimes should be taken seriously and punished accordingly. The LGBTQ+ community still faces discrimination and hate crimes, despite the progress made over the years. It is important to acknowledge that legislation plays a significant role in addressing this issue. States need to recognize and address hate crimes as a serious offense and provide justice to the victims. In conclusion, Mallory Owens' case sheds light on the importance of recognizing hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community.

By incorporating both into your routine, you can ensure that your body is in top condition and that any potential issues are caught early.

To get the most benefit, consider challenging your brain along with your body by incorporating mental demands into your exercise regimen. This could mean trying a new physical activity that requires learning new skills or practicing cognitive exercises like Sudoku or crossword puzzles as you work out. 2. Practice balance exercises. As you get older, maintaining your balance can become more challenging. Simple exercises like standing on one foot or practicing yoga can help you maintain a steady gait and prevent falls. 3. Wear protective headwear. If you engage in activities that increase your risk of head injury, such as biking or contact sports, make sure to wear appropriate head protection like a helmet. Likewise, if you work in an industry that could expose you to head injuries, consult with your employer about the appropriate safety gear. 4. Get regular checkups. Regular checkups with your healthcare provider are crucial for catching problems early. Be honest with your provider about any health concerns or symptoms you may be experiencing, and follow up on recommended screenings and tests. 5. Get enough rest. In addition to physical exercise and regular checkups, getting enough rest is also essential for your health. Aim for at least seven hours of sleep each night to help your body regenerate and recover from the day's stresses. By incorporating these five habits into your routine, you can help prevent health problems before they start. Remember to view your healthcare provider as a partner in your health journey and to communicate openly and honestly with them about your concerns.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful broodrearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extrapair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extrapair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extrapair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.
