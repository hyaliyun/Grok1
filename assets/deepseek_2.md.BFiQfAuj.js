Immutability: Functional programming promotes immutability, meaning that once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed. This eliminates the problem of side effects and makes programs easier to reason about. 2. Pure functions: A pure function is a function that relies only on its inputs to produce an output. It has no side effects, such as modifying external state or performing I/O operations. Pure functions are easier to test and reason about, and they can be composed to form more complex programs. 3. Higher-order functions: In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, meaning that they can be treated as values and passed around like other data. Higher-order functions take other functions as inputs or return functions as outputs. This allows for more complex and flexible programs. 4. Recursion: Recursion is a natural fit for functional programming because it avoids modifying state and allows for elegant solutions to problems that would be cumbersome with iterative looping. 5. Referential transparency: When a function always produces the same output given the same input and has no side effects, it is said to be referentially transparent. This property makes it easy to reason about the behavior of functions and to optimize code."},{"instruction":"Explain why bathing is important for personal hygiene.","output":"Bathing is important for personal hygiene because it helps to remove dirt, sweat, and dead skin cells from the body.

The lords had significant power and influence over their territories, and they were responsible for the welfare and protection of their subjects.

This means that there are more resources and tools available for React developers, and it's often easier to find help when encountering problems. 5.

Ferric iron must first be reduced to ferrous iron by the enzyme duodenal cytochrome B (DcytB) before it can be absorbed by the same transport mechanism. Once inside intestinal cells, iron ions can be stored as ferritin or transported in the blood bound to transport proteins such as transferrin. Iron absorption is influenced by a number of factors such as the amount of iron in the diet, the presence of other dietary components (such as calcium, phytates, or tannins) that can decrease or increase iron absorption, and individual variations in physiological needs and genetic factors."},{"instruction":"Give me a list of the current Croatian politicians and their parties.","output":"1.
