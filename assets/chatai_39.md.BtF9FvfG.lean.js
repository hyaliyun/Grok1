At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions as many acidbase reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest.

Take the time to review and update your resume, ensuring that it's tailored to the position you're applying for. Another important aspect to consider when seeking employment is your contract. Many employers require applicants to sign a contract that outlines expectations, compensation, and other important details. Be sure to review your contract, and understand any commitments or limitations it may impose on you. If you find yourself out of work, it's important to consider unemployment benefits. This can provide a temporary source of income while you search for a new job. Check with your state's unemployment office to see if you qualify and what steps you need to take to file. Additionally, having references can be a valuable asset in your job search. Reach out to former coworkers, supervisors, or other professional contacts who can attest to your skills and reliability. Be sure to ask for their permission before putting them on your resume or using them as a reference. Lastly, make yourself available. Be open to different opportunities and job roles, and make time for interviews and follow-up meetings with potential employers.

However, eavesdropping is not a good idea. It can be emotionally distressing to hear your parents argue, and it can also cause misunderstandings that can further provoke the argument. Instead, find a calmer place, such as your room or a quiet spot outside, where you can remove yourself from the argument. This will not only help you avoid listening to the argument, but it will also give you an opportunity to calm down and think clearly. If you can't leave the house, try to find a way to escape the fight, such as listening to music, reading a book, or doing an activity you enjoy. This will help distract you from the argument so you can focus your attention on something positive. In some cases, however, arguments can escalate and become violent or aggressive. If this happens, it is important to know when to call the Emergency Services. If you feel unsafe in your home during an argument or see your parents fighting physically, call the police or emergency services immediately. Don't hesitate to call for help, as it could save lives and prevent further harm. In summary, when parents argue, it's important not to eavesdrop, find a calm place, and try to escape the situation if possible. If the argument becomes violent, call the Emergency Services to ensure your safety and the safety of your family. Remember that it’s normal for parents to argue, but what's important is the way they resolve conflicts in a peaceful and respectful manner."},{"instruction":"Report: India has the highest suicide rate worldwide for ages 15 to 29. A father recounts finding his son dead before exam results were due. A suicide prevention worker says he blames a breakdown in family structures. India this week made it no longer a crime to attempt suicide. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"India has recently made headlines for having the highest suicide rate worldwide for ages 15 to 29. Unfortunately, this issue hit close to home for a father who found his son dead before exam results were due. A suicide prevention worker believes that a breakdown in family structures may be to blame. The sad reality of this situation is that suicide is a growing concern globally. However, India has seen a sharp increase in suicides, especially among youth. According to reports, 28% of all suicides in India are committed by young people between the ages of 15 to 29. With the added pressure of academic success, many young people in India are feeling overwhelmed and alone. The recent incident with the father who found his son dead only adds to the growing concern. As a society, we need to take steps to address this issue and provide those who may be feeling alone or lost with support. Suicide prevention worker, Sanjay Jha, believes that the breakdown of family structures is contributing to the rise in suicide rates. Many young people in India are left feeling isolated and unsupported by their families, which can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair. Sanjay Jha suggests that families need to be more involved in their children's lives and provide them with the emotional support they need to thrive. In a positive step forward, India has made it no longer a crime to attempt suicide. Previously, those who attempted suicide would face jail time or fines. This move is a step towards acknowledging that mental health issues need to be addressed and that those who are struggling need support, not punishment. In conclusion, India's high suicide rates, especially among young people, is a growing concern. It is crucial that we address this issue by providing support to those who may be struggling with mental health issues. Families need to be more involved in their children's lives, and India's recent move to decriminalize suicide attempts is a positive step towards recognizing the importance of mental health."},{"instruction":"Review: that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Stoke City's summer signing Bojan Krkic made a statement of intent by scoring a crucial goal in his team's pre-season friendly against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. The Spanish forward, who arrived at the Britannia Stadium from Barcelona, grabbed the equalizer for the Potters after Blackburn's Jordan Rhodes had opened the scoring. The match was a valuable exercise for both sides, as they prepare for their respective domestic campaigns. Stoke, who narrowly avoided relegation last season, will be hoping that Bojan's arrival can bring a fresh attacking impetus to their play. The 23-year-old, who has played for some of Europe's biggest clubs, will be looking to prove his worth in the competitive Premier League. Despite the positive result, Stoke manager Mark Hughes will be aware that there are still areas of his team's play that need improvement. The Potters conceded early in the game and were unable to capitalize on their possession and chances. More clinical finishing will be needed if they are to challenge higher up the table. Stoke have two more pre-season friendlies scheduled before their opening day fixture against Aston Villa. The team will be looking to build on the positives from their performance against Blackburn and develop their style of play further. Bojan's goal will have given the squad a boost of confidence and belief, as they aim to improve on their 13th place finish from last season.

Read examples of fairy tale retellings.","output":"Fairy tales have been beloved stories for centuries. However, retellings are a great way to refresh these old stories and make them relevant to contemporary audiences. If you're thinking of retelling a fairy tale, there are several things you can do to make it unique. The first thing you can do is choose a new or different perspective. This means retelling the story from the point of view of a different character. For example, instead of retelling Cinderella from her perspective, you could tell the story from the Fairy Godmother's point of view. This perspective shift can bring new insights and perspectives to the story while also keeping the elements of the original fairy tale. Updating the setting is another great way to update a fairy tale retelling. Instead of setting a story in a fictional kingdom, the story could be set in a modern city. This kind of change can help contemporary audiences better connect with the story and its themes. Updating the setting can also make the fairy tale more relatable to today's readers. Recasting the main characters is a bold move, but it can be incredibly effective. Changing the race, gender, or sexuality of the main characters can bring new perspectives to the story. For example, retelling Snow White with a diverse cast of characters or making the main character LGBTQ+ could give the story a unique and modern twist. Expanding or adjusting the existing plot is another way to retell a fairy tale. This can involve filling in gaps in the original story or adding new subplots. Be mindful, though, not to stray too far from the original story, as you want to keep the elements that make the fairy tale so beloved. There are countless examples of fairy tale retellings out there. For example, \\"Wicked\\" retells \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" from the perspective of the Wicked Witch of the West. \\"Ella Enchanted\\" is a retelling of \\"Cinderella\\" that focuses on the relationship between Ella and her fairy godmother. And \\"Frozen\\" is a retelling of \\"The Snow Queen\\" with a modern twist. In the end, the key to a great fairy tale retelling is to make it unique and relevant to contemporary audiences. By choosing a new perspective, updating the setting, recasting the main characters, or expanding the plot, you can create a story that is both fresh and familiar."},{"instruction":"Read this: Sony officially unveiled PlayStation 3 (then marketed as PLAYSTATION 3) to the public on May 16, 2005, at E3 2005, along with a 'boomerang' shaped prototype design of the Sixaxis controller.

According to data collected over the years, the scores began to trend upwards in the early 2000s and went on until about 2014, when they started to dip. This upward trend can be linked to several factors, including increased funding for education, improved training for teachers, and advanced teaching methodologies that were implemented to improve the quality of education in schools. Additionally, the increased focus on monitoring and evaluating student performance helped to identify areas of weakness and provide interventions that helped to improve student scores. However, despite the initial success, the trend was not sustained. There are several reasons why this happened. One of the reasons is the challenge of maintaining a sustainable budget, which led to budget cuts in education. With less funding, it became difficult to provide quality education, as the necessary resources were not available to support teachers and students. Additionally, the implementation of new testing standards and policies contributed to the decline in performance, as teachers struggled to adapt to the new changes. In conclusion, the scores on the state standardized test trended upward for around 14 years before declining. Although there were clear improvements that were made due to increased funding, advanced teaching methodologies and improved teacher training, sustaining the progress was a challenge. With cuts to funding, new testing standards, and other challenges, maintaining progress became increasingly difficult."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"Life is full of opportunities, let's embrace every moment with a positive outlook and make the most out of every experience! #positivity #motivation\\""},{"instruction":"f A man crossing a natural stone bridge jumps while in the middle of it., can we conclude A man crossed natural stone bridge and jumped in the middle.?

These devices, such as the Oculus Rift, have already received rave reviews from users and technology enthusiasts, and the promise of a consumer version has many people excited about the future. One of the most exciting aspects of the technology created by Oculus VR is its ability to transport users to new and exciting virtual environments. This could revolutionize the way we consume media, from watching movies and playing video games, to exploring new places and meeting new people. The technology's creators believe that this could even change the way we learn, offering an immersive and interactive platform that could transform education as we know it.

These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge.

Set up the Chinese Chess Board: The board is a rectangular shape and has nine lines in each direction. These lines help to divide the board into two equal halves. Each end of the board has a palace, which is where the kings are placed. The board should be placed between the two players, so each player has a palace facing them. 2. Familiarize Yourself with the Lines on the Board: The lines on the board are used to identify the position of each piece. The lines are numbered from one to nine, starting from the player's side of the board. The horizontal lines are marked with the letters A to I. 3. Learn about the Chinese Chess Pieces: There are 32 pieces in Chinese chess, and each player gets 16 pieces. The pieces are divided into two sides, Red and Black. Each side has a king, two advisors, two elephants, two horses, two chariots, and five pawns. 4. Place Your Pieces on the Board: Each player starts with a king in the palace.

This not only helps the polish adhere better to the nail, but also prevents yellowing and staining of the nails. Before starting, gather all the necessary tools and materials. Choose a small cup to pour the nail polish into, and place it on top of a sheet of newspaper to catch any spills or drips. Next, choose your desired nail polish shade. Consider the occasion, your outfit, or your personal style when selecting a color. Once you have chosen a color, shake the bottle well before opening it to ensure the polish is thoroughly mixed. With the base coat applied, dip the brush into the polish and wipe off the excess on the rim of the cup. Apply the polish to each nail, starting from the base and moving towards the tip in three strokes — one on each side of the nail, and one down the center. Once the polish has dried, apply a second coat following the same steps as before. This will help ensure full coverage and an even finish. Finally, finish off with a top coat to seal in the color and add shine. By following these simple steps, you can achieve a salon-quality manicure at home.

Trucks are carrying 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including cereal, medicine and sleeping bags.","output":"According to a recent report, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's phone was hacked while overseas. This news adds to the already tense conversation between Australia and Russia regarding aid trucks headed to Ukraine. Bishop has accused Russia of using the humanitarian crisis as a way to shift people and equipment into Ukraine. These comments have frustrated Russia's foreign ministry who denies any military intervention plans. Instead, the 280 aid trucks are carrying 2,000 tonnes of necessary items such as cereal, medicine, and sleeping bags. This situation highlights the difficulties of managing a humanitarian crisis during times of political tension. While aid is desperately needed in Ukraine, accusations and suspicions between countries can create obstacles for those trying to provide help. It is important for all involved parties to work towards a common goal of providing assistance to those in need, and to do so without politicizing the situation. The aid trucks headed towards Ukraine are a positive step in helping those affected by the conflict, but it is necessary for countries to find ways to work together without unnecessary discord. The alleged phone hacking of Bishop adds an additional layer of tension to an already complex situation. It remains to be seen how the situation will develop, but the focus must remain on providing aid to those who need it. The contents of the aid trucks are a reminder that there are real people in Ukraine who require assistance during this difficult time. It is essential that we do not lose sight of this fact, and that political issues do not hinder humanitarian efforts."},{"instruction":"(1) He began his studies in 1946 at the Main Reformed Gimnázium in Debrecen , and from 1947 to 1951 , he attended the Madách Gimnázium in Budapest .

Leave the strips to harden.","output":"Barley Sugar Recipe: How to Make Hard Candy at Home If you're looking for a sweet and satisfying treat to make at home, look no further than barley sugar. This classic hard candy is made by cooking hulled barley in water and then boiling it down with sugar until it reaches the \\"hard crack\\" stage at 156ºC/310ºF. Once poured onto a lined tray or oiled slab and cut into strips, it hardens into a crunchy and delicious confection. Before starting, make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment you'll need. This includes hulled barley, water, sugar, a candy thermometer, a lined tray or oiled slab, and lightly oiled scissors. To begin, gently cook the hulled barley in the water for 5 hours. This will allow the barley to release its starches and create a sweet syrup. Once cooked, strain the liquid to remove any solids. Next, warm the sugar in a separate pan, being careful not to let it burn. Once warmed, add the barley syrup and continue to heat the mixture until it reaches the hard crack stage at 156ºC/310ºF. This can take anywhere from 20-40 minutes depending on your stove and equipment, so be patient and keep a watchful eye on the mixture. Once the candy syrup is ready, pour it onto your lined tray or oiled slab and allow it to cool for a few minutes. When it's cool enough to handle, use lightly oiled scissors to cut the barley sugar into long strips. Be sure to work quickly, as the candy hardens rapidly once it starts to cool. Finally, leave the strips to harden completely before enjoying. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen. In conclusion, making your own barley sugar at home is a fun and rewarding process that results in a delicious and crunchy candy treat. With just a few simple ingredients and some patience, you can create a sweet and satisfying confection that's sure to impress."},{"instruction":"w does the next paragraph end?

AlShabaab warns contractors who help distribute food to stop helping the U.N. agency. Somalia is in the middle of its worst crisis since the famine of the 1990s, according to the WFP.","output":"Somalia is currently facing its worst crisis since the famine of the 1990s, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). However, in the midst of this crisis, Islamic militants, specifically al-Shabaab, have accused the WFP of causing problems by importing food from outside the country. Al-Shabaab has gone as far as warning contractors who help distribute food to cease their collaboration with the U.N. agency. The militants believe that importing food from outside the country undermines the local economy and creates dependency on foreign aid. While it is true that promoting local production is key to achieving long-term food security in Somalia, it is important to recognize that importing food from outside is sometimes necessary, especially in the midst of a severe crisis such as the one faced by the country. According to the WFP, more than 5 million people in Somalia currently need assistance to meet their food and nutrition needs. It is also worth noting that the WFP does work with local farmers and suppliers to promote local agriculture and boost the local economy. The agency has been investing in cash-based transfers, allowing beneficiaries to purchase food from local markets instead of relying solely on imported items. In addition, the accusations made by al-Shabaab are particularly concerning given their past history of targeting aid agencies and their staff. The militants have also been known to create barriers that prevent aid from getting to the communities that need it the most. All in all, it is clear that the WFP's efforts to support the people of Somalia are vital in the current crisis. While promoting local production should be a priority in the long run, importing food from outside the country is necessary to provide life-saving assistance to millions of Somalis in dire need. It is crucial that aid organizations have access to all areas of the country and the necessary support to carry out their mission safely and effectively."},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: Who kicked the longest field goal of the game?","output":"The question \\"Who kicked the longest field goal of the game?\\" is a specific one that can only be answered with context about which game is being referred to.

But I was wrong. As you maybe have read in earlier published comments, I agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother.

Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting. Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.

Today's temperatures may not be quite that extreme, but they are still cause for concern. On Saturday, Death Valley saw temperatures reach 127 degrees Fahrenheit, a scorching and potentially deadly level. As we face the realities of climate change and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves, it's important that we take precautions to stay safe and protect ourselves from the dangers of excessive heat. Whether it's staying indoors during the hottest parts of the day, staying hydrated, or checking in on vulnerable members of our communities, there are steps we can all take to help mitigate the impact of extreme heat. As we continue to face the harsh realities of climate change, it's important that we work together to adapt and ensure that our communities remain resilient in the face of these challenges."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: a crowd of almost one hundred taiwanese expatriates cheered taipei mayor ma yingjeou upon his arrival at new york 's jfk airport sunday .","output":"Taiwanese expatriates welcomed Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou with cheers as he arrived at JFK Airport in New York."},{"instruction":"Next question: when was school games federation of india formed?","output":"School Games Federation of India was formed in the year __1959__."},{"instruction":"ere is some data about a restaurant: name = Loch Fyne, eatType = restaurant, food = French, familyFriendly = yes.

They are achieved by successfully carrying or throwing the ball into the opposing team's end zone. A touchdown is worth 6 points and is followed by an extra point attempt, which can add an additional point to the team's score. Now, to answer the question, in which yard line were multiple touchdowns scored? the answer will depend on the specific game being referred to. Multiple touchdowns can be scored from different yard lines, depending on the team's offensive performance and the defensive capabilities of the opposing team. In some games, a team may have a dominant offense that is able to score touchdowns from various yard lines on the field. For example, a team with a strong quarterback and fast wide receivers may be able to score touchdowns from far down the field, starting from the 40-yard line or even further back. In other games, a team may struggle to score touchdowns early on in the game, but as their offense gains momentum, they may begin scoring touchdowns from closer to the end zone. This can happen when a team's running game gains traction, and they are able to chip away at the yardage needed to score a touchdown. In summary, the answer to the question of what yard line multiple touchdowns were scored on will vary depending on the specific game being referred to. It is important to note that the ability to consistently score touchdowns is essential to winning football games, and is a reflection of successful offensive gameplay."},{"instruction":"Generate a movie review with positive sentiment.","output":"I recently watched the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and I must say, it was absolutely incredible.

Some individuals may experience anxiety in specific situations, such as public restrooms. Public restrooms can be a source of embarrassment, discomfort, and fear for many people, and avoiding them altogether can create significant inconvenience. If you are someone who experiences anxiety related to public restrooms, talking to your doctor is a great starting point. They can provide you with a proper diagnosis and recommend different treatment options that suit your specific situation. Medications, psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy can help manage anxiety in most instances. One of the most common symptoms of anxiety is feeling nervous or uneasy in new or uncomfortable situations. In the case of public restrooms, individuals may feel overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings, concerns about hygiene, or privacy. Fear of judgment from others for any issue is another common cause of anxiety that may manifest in public restrooms. It is crucial to understand that anxiety is a treatable condition, and avoiding public restrooms should not be the only solution. With professional help and guidance, you can learn a variety of coping methods to help reduce anxiety levels effectively.

It's alarming and disappointing that Uganda's Parliament will once again consider the antihomosexuality bill, said Michelle Kagari, the deputy Africa program director at Amnesty International.

Investigators believe devices may have been made by same bombmaker. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"PETN Explosive: The Lethal Powder that is Hard to Detect PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate, is a powerful explosive that is difficult to detect. This white powder is hard to ignite, making it easy to smuggle and conceal. However, despite its inert appearance, PETN poses a significant threat in the hands of terrorists and other nefarious individuals. Recently, PETN devices have been making headlines due to their potential deadly consequences. According to CNN, an explosives expert has called PETN devices \\"murderous,\\" highlighting just how lethal they can be. PETN was also the explosive material used by the infamous \\"underwear bomber\\" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who attempted to blow up a flight over Detroit in 2009. Now, investigators believe that the recent PETN devices found in both the UK and Dubai may have been made by the same bomb-maker. This raises concerns about the sophistication of the devices and the capabilities of those who create them. The ability to create such dangerous devices highlights the need for improved security measures at airports and other public places. Detection techniques must be advanced to prevent the smuggling of PETN and other explosives, as well as the individuals who would use them. PETN is a potent reminder that we must remain vigilant in the fight against terrorism and other forms of violence. The ability of a small amount of white powder to cause so much harm and devastation should not be underestimated.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Napoleon established a political system that historian Martyn Lyons called dictatorship by plebiscite. Worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution, but unwilling to ignore them entirely, Napoleon resorted to regular electoral consultations with the French people on his road to imperial power. He drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII and secured his own election as First Consul, taking up residence at the Tuileries.
