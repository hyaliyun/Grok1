There are various e-learning courses available, yet not every one of them is advantageous to join. Thus, it is difficult to research this topic. But we can definitely minimize the traveling cost and board fees. There isn't anything in this whole universe to which we can call PERFECT. Every single item has its own benefits and restrictions. Like we cannot even call the sun perfect despite the fact that it is the most brilliant star, however, is the most blazing one as well. Then, at that point, how do we expect anyone or some other lifeless thing to be perfect? Coming back to the online and offline classes, each has its own upsides and downsides. The corona pandemic requests for online classes. This is an innovative as well as a safe education system. The fees structure of online classes is comparatively very less than any offline classes and we all know that the fees have always been a decisive factor for the students. It is a good option for students who have a shortage of money. Notwithstanding, learners will agree that all the e-learning sessions are more affordable. Students who are not able to come to the big schools and college due to distance will also like this new way of learning. They get the opportunity to communicate with the teachers to get the answer to their doubts. This increases their confidence. Online classes come with one more advantage that students can study while they can do other tasks like jobs. They can get practical experience in their field and also be present at online classes with the help of online class helpers like Tutors Sky who can attend your classes and exams on your behalf. Just contact them and tell them that you can pay someone to take my online class."},{"instruction":"What facts about Mumbai would people not believe unless they come to Mumbai?","output":"1.

It is characterized by a tumble in industrial production, an increase in unemployment rates, and a contraction of gross domestic product (GDP). Businesses experience lower sales and profits during a recession, which results in layoffs and lower consumer spending. Factors Responsible for Recession A considerable fall over at least two consecutive quarters is considered a recession. A recession may be caused by a number of factors, including: Economic cycles Economies typically go through periods of expansion and contraction, known as economic cycles. When there is a persistent drop in economic growth during the contraction phase, a recession happens. Financial crises Recessions can start when there is a significant disruption in the financial system, like a banking crisis or a stock market fall. These occurrences frequently result in a loss of confidence among investors and consumers, which lowers spending and investment. Tight monetary policy To combat inflation, central banks will occasionally adopt strict monetary policies by hiking interest rates. While doing so may aid in price stabilization, it may also result in less borrowing and expenditure, which would impede the economy. External shocks The world economy can be significantly impacted by major occurrences such as wars, natural disasters, or international crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). These outside shocks have the potential to break up supply networks and reduce trade, which ultimately triggers a recession.

What do you make of this statement?","output":"Well, this Richard guy says “almost” which means he is not in complete denial of grammar and its importance in the English language. To my subjective experience, I concur that if you involve too much grammar in your language, particularly if that language is NOT your native one, then it becomes problematic for you, as you can’t converse or write comfortably in that language. I believe that the value of grammar is undeniable, but being obsessed with it every time you try to write or converse in your language will not benefit you, in terms of helping you out with your creative expressions. That said, I will not advise anyone to be a grammar nazi. The most important thing for any language to sound GREAT is to make sure you mean what you mean, clearly. By the way, Grammar evolves through the courses of time. The grammatical rules you read five years back may not hold true in today’s context. The reason most people don't like Grammar is that it teaches you how to discipline your language, something that many people are not comfortable following. If that were not the case, I have seen several news articles on NYT and many leading newspaper outlets riddled with grammatical mistakes. The reason is people are beginning to devalue Grammar and focus more on what makes something click-baits. Even today, most people think that “TO” is an INFINITIVE, not a PREPOSITION, too. What do you make of it? People are crazy? Well, I would not think like that, but I feel that people don't like what makes them write and read within disciplinary boundaries. For example, many people don’t take a PAUSE while reading certain texts that follow a comma. Why? Because, either they were not schooled to learn Grammar properly or they don't give a damn, until of course, some educated fellows correct it. My point? Grammar is very important in any language, but many people use it to the degree of love they have for Grammar."},{"instruction":"'m afraid and shy to talk to beautiful girls, what are some tips and cheats to overcome it?","output":"Remember that you are not talking to a beautiful woman, but you are speaking to a person, just another person.

My opinion completely changed after that with reasons being: Computer touch screens are not the highest quality. That isn't to say they wouldn't work, but it isn't like using your tablet or your smartphone. You will touch the screen and there will be a lot of give. The screen will be awkward and it won't be a pleasant experience. A normal computer interface doesn't work well with touch. This would require Apple to redesign OS X a lot and make it more of a hybrid software, otherwise your finger would mess up with tiny icons. OS X would then lose its functionality as being the easy-to-use computer operating system with this added complexity, which isn't something Apple really wants to do. The experience of computer touch screens is awkward. There are times when I thought having touch in a computer would be useful, but I have chalked that up to poor screen resolution and lack of appropriate touch hardware (powerful smartphone or tablet). You can get tasks done much easier and efficiently with a powerful touch device that is optimized for touch and an interface of the hands. Your computer is not this and already has its own input devices: keyboard and mouse/trackpad. These are sufficient for a powerful computer with proper screen resolution.Overall, it just isn't a pleasant experience. The software is buggy and sometimes will not work properly. Nothing is optimized. I am completely content with a non-touch computer, especially when I have an iPhone and iPad that can do most of my touch functions for me, and much better than my computer could ever."},{"instruction":"w do Democrats explain the peerreviewed paper on the 4 hidden algorithms found in the NY voter rolls using multiple obfuscation techniques built into the system?","output":"The algorithms with multiple obfuscation techniques built into the systems are, simply put, encryption algorithms.

Here are a few. I presume you mean self-sustaining life. First you would need living soil that is able to produce edible food. That is the focus of this answer. This would not be an easy thing to do. Otherwise, you would need a steady transport of food from Earth to Mars. It would be very difficult to transplant life-sustaining soil from Earth to Mars in a sustainable fashion. The web of life on Earth is very intricate. The vast majority of currently existing species on Earth on which our lives depend, have neither been studied nor even named. There are “legions” of unnamed species of bacteria, algae, fungi, tardigrades, viruses and possibly other groups of micro-organisms that make it possible for our Earthly trophic web to recycle matter in a re-usable sustainable way. These are often referred to as decomposers and detrivores. They exist in the soil, and to a lesser extent in the water and air of the Earth. They also exist in our gut, on our skin, and in a sense within every cell of our bodies. These micro-organisms form the bio-machinery that extracts minerals from the soil, moves them into plants, from there to animals, and from there to our gut and into our cells, and then ultimately returns the waste to the soil again for recycling. Every species on Earth has its own “microbiome” of such micro-organisms living in its own gut/interior that enable it to specialize in a type of rock or plant or animal as food. For example, panda bears can only eat bamboo shoots; koala bears can only eat eucalyptus trees; dogs fare best on partially rotted meat, but people become violently ill on partially rotted meat; etc. For each and every species that you wish to see living on Mars, you need 1) a suitable trophic sub-web that will extract and prepare the vitamins, minerals, proteins and other nutrients in the environment for consumption; 2) digest the nutrients once consumed; and 3) process the waste effectively after elimination. It took billions of years for the trophic web of the Earth to evolve to the intricate machine we see today. The vast majority of species that performed the work of building that trophic web are now extinct, though many (or all?) of their extant descendants now have a role. A question we must consider is how many of the currently extant species on Earth could survive on a pristine lifeless plant (such as I imagine Mars is) and so begin the long work of transforming its soil into something that will support Earth-generated life? This is just a guess, but I think that for any planet to be able to sustain life from Earth, it would require a massive transplant of soil and plants and animals from Earth, and a few million years of evolution, to terraform the planet and make it able to sustain human life. But, of course, by then, we would also have evolved dramatically. Alternately, we might just seek out a planet that has already evolved a suitable trophic web that humans could live in, like we see in Star Trek and Star Wars movies. That would require a dual oxygen/carbon-dioxide trophic web that has photo-synthesis as the means to capture energy from star-light, and make it available to our blood, and remove the wastes from our body again. It would have to generate proteins composed of DNA with structures that the acids and enzymes of our bodies could effectively process. It would need to generate carbohydrates such as sugars, starches, and fats that are digestible. Such a trophic web would also need to generate oxygen in sufficient quantities, and absorb carbon-dioxide in sufficient quantities, giving us the oxygen cycle. There are many other materials that must be recycled in the correct mix. I suspect that such life-bearing planets are extremely rare, if not entirely unique. Even in the vast reaches of space, with billions of stars per galaxy, and billions of galaxies, there may be only one on which we could survive without serious terraforming, and/or drastic evolutionary adaptations of our own bodies at the cost of many generations of lives. My GUESS is that we just get “one kick at the can”. There is only one planet in all of space on which we humanity can produce a sustainable civilization that is ecologically well-adjusted. We should focus some effort on doing that.

We have full employment and companies are quitting China and the rest of the world and moving here. The impact is enormous for America and will continue to play out long after Trump leaves office. Mark Cuban does have strategic insights on anything other than what his rich liberal friends think. He has no idea of what Trump is doing and would reverse direction. We can’t afford that.

There are some countries that still restrict abortion. Until recently, the Republic of Ireland forbade abortion even in the most urgent situations; this is still true of Malta, and of a number of Latin American countries. While most Western industrialized nations have very liberal abortion laws, many still do have some restrictions on later abortions, and these appear to have been sufficient to achieve a social consensus. Canada, which has essentially no abortion law at present, still has an active pro-life movement. However, apparently it is not large enough to affect the outcome of elections, since our Conservative party keeps making efforts to avoid having its MPs make statements about abortion. So the United States isn’t absolutely unique. One reason that has been mentioned is that the issue was decided in the courts, instead of by the people through their elected representatives, as was the case in other countries. This is a fact, and indeed it can be frustrating to those on the pro-life side. But abortion isn’t the only issue that was decided that way in the United States. For example, contraception was legalized in the United States by the case Griswold v. Connecticut. Because of the way the American political system works, conservative religious groups wield a lot of power, and many politicians are basically terrified of taking positiions they disagree with. Also, the U.S. Constitution gives a lot of powers to the individual States that, in most countries, wkould belong to the national government: counterfeiting money is a Federal crime, but murder, theft, arson, robbery, rape, assault, and most other crimes are prohibited in each of the 50 states by the laws of each of those individual states. So many necessary changes to keep up with the modern world have had to be made by the courts. The Federal Government simply did not have the authority to pass a law requiring every State to conform to the norms of the 20th Century, at least not in most cases. In some cases, it was given that right - by a Constitutional amendment, and these are difficult to obtain, requiring the support of 38 out of the 50 states. Another factor is that abortion is an inherently contentious issue. Perhaps the reason it isn’t as controversial in other countries is that they are more homogenous. Most European countries had, and some still have, an “established church”; that is, a church with special legal status. At one time, everyone was expected to belong to the national church, possibly with some special exceptions being made for certain groups, like Jews. Over time, this changed to the modern norm of religious tolerance. Because of this, in many European countries, people will tell you they don’t take religion all that seriously. In others, the established church still is the one people follow for the most part, but it is a modern liberal and ecumenical church. Religious liberty, on the other hand, has been an absolute in American law from the very founding of the United States. So people belong to many different denominations, and many of them take the teachings of their faith very seriously indeed. Not, perhaps, quite as seriously as many Muslims living in Muslim-majority nations - but the basic idea that the commands of God are the fundamental source of all right and wrong is present. A case against abortion certainly can be made. After all, we recognize the killing of young babies who can’t talk yet as full-fledged homicide, which may be murder or manslaughter. Why should a fetus be any different? Yes, it has a connection with its mother, but then so does a baby before it is weaned. What about bodily autonomy? We don’t force people to donate a kidney, for example, even if someone else’s life depends on it. There is a counter-argument here: it goes like this - yes, we agree that if a fertility clinic has a problem with its freezer, it can’t compel random women to bear the embryos they have, even though that’s necessary to save their lives. Abortion, though, is an interference in the situation of a woman who is already pregnant. Bodily autonomy prevents people from having things inflicted on them even to save a life; it doesn’t permit them to inflict things on others, and the fetus is viewed as a full-fledged other. I could go on, but I’m not trying to make the full pro-life case here. I do, though, want to point out that many of the favored arguments made for abortion freedom are not fully fleshed out, as those making them have often not taken the other side’s views seriously enough. Therefore, these arguments often seem to be dishonest or hypocritical, because those presenting them seem to have gotten sloppy. One example might be the argument “If you don’t like abortion, don’t have one”. Some people say that as though it settles the abortion question. What’s the comeback? How about this: well then, why didn’t “If you don’t like Negro slavery, don’t own a slave” settle the slavery question, and prevent the Civil War? The answer is obvious: that did nothing for protecting black people from being enslaved. So anyone who claims that “If you don’t like abortion, don’t have one” settles the question… has obviously given zero weight to the claim that fetuses are real people just as babies are real people, and hasn’t even tried to explain why they aren’t. Why haven’t most pro-choice advocates taken the pro-life position seriously enough to present arguments that, even if those on the pro-life side still aren’t persuaded to agree with them, they would at least be brought to see the pro-choice viewpoint as worthy of respect? There are a number of reasons for this. I am going to focus on a couple that I think are relevant. One is that many would feel it isn’t worth the effort. Since opposition to abortion often has religious roots, and religious beliefs are generally strong, fixed, and unchangeable, no amount of argumentation will make a difference. Another is that many on the pro-choice side feel, and with good reason, that nearly all of those on the pro-life side really aren’t concerned all that much about protecting fetal life at all. Instead, their real goal is to impose a certain standard of sexual morality on everyone. Because many opponents of abortion are strongly religious, and they believe that God is the source of all right and wrong, they often don’t make a distinction between “God says it’s wrong to kill your neighbor” and “God says it’s wrong to have sexual relations outside marriage” with the former being something the State may enforce, and the latter not. And one illustration of this is that at one point a prominent evangelist in the U.S. made a public statement, widely reported at the time, that he recommened giving up on the “lost” battle against abortion, and focusing instead on a new battle that could still be won: the one against gay marriage. Also, the same conservative religious elements that oppose abortion the most strongly are uncomfortable with the best argument against it: it’s wrong to treat people differently based on an irrelvant characteristic, like are they born yet. Because a good chunk of them actively want to go back to the days of segregation. So they do not see the reasoning on which the Civil Rights movement was based as genuinely valid! (Mind you, they may recognize the analogy, and see liberal support for abortion as proof those liberals were hypocrites all along.) So a great many factors combine in the United States to make abortion especially contentious. A wide variety of religious backgrounds, which differ in their fundamental world views.A political structure that allows different regions in the country to get far out of step with each other.A strong political culture of individual rights, which can be wielded in different ways by both sides in the debate.A still unresolved issue of racial equality that is a rich source of analogies.

Private consumption: the fear of the virus has changed the consumption behaviour of the citizens. People are purchasing only the essential commodities and saving the rest as precautionary savings. Disturbed logistics, loss of jobs, lack of activities have impacted the purchasing power of the citizens. Hence, India must create credit availability to improve the purchasing power and also provide enough evidence to encourage them to normalise their behaviour. 2.) Investment: the second biggest contribution to GDP is investment. Because of the pandemic, investors and the creditors are highly pessimistic. They are keeping low expectations of the future profitability. India must provide ground to change their risk averse behaviour and encourage them to start investing in the productive activities of the nation. 3.) Public Expenditure: best way to cope with shocks is to provide insulation from those shocks. Providing for the health infrastructure development, social inclusion and support to the MSMEs and Trade sector, which forms the biggest contributors to GDP should be the prime focus of the government for the economic recovery. India has been making good efforts in these directions already. Achieving an average of 1cr doses of vaccination per day. ECLGS, LTRO, TLTRO, moratorium, priority sector leaning guidelines, 23000 cr investment in health sector, eSHRAM, eRUPI, tax credit, PMJBY and many more schemes and steps have been taken since the pandemic hit India.

I was traveling to Las Vegas for drag races in 2015. As we were traveling on the I-15 headed from California into Nevada, there is a long grade downhill. I was following a brand new truck and he was doing about 90MPH, well the grade comes up and he just increases speed and so did I, I was doing 120MPH when I was caught on radar, the truck was not caught, way to go always be the lead, never be second, second gets caught. So the officer walks up and says, you know I could take you to jail? To which I say yes sir! He then says he really doesn’t want to impound the car and make it a hassle so he will write the ticket for 90 plus in a 70mph zone, no reckless ticket 🙏. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I get the ticket in the mail, 1440 dollars and years of extra insurance . So I hire a lawyer and get off free and clear. The lawyer would not divulge the trade secret but he must have been good, I never appeared and I have no ticket for 90 mph plus on my driving record! For anyone thinking 100mph plus is a good idea, it must be something you think about before you attempt it. Most vehicles are not maintained well enough to achieve triple digits in speed for any length of time. I’ve been to 160MPH on a road and can tell you it’s not for the faint of heart, my vision was almost at the limit it could perceive things. Legally everything that happens at triple digit speeds will be your fault and your fault only so don’t do it, the reward isn’t worth the risk or cost. Stick to race tracks for triple digits and no ticket will be possible, the cost of parts will increase exponentially however!!! Enjoy!"},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

Ten czarno-białe zdjęcie zostało zrobione przez Indian Fotograf Raghu Rai. Pablo Podjęła kolorowe zdjęcie. Union Carbide of India Ltd, jointly owned by Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation of USA with 50.9% and Union of India and other stake holders with 49.10%, with an intent to manufacture pesticides for Indian as well as international markets established a unit near Bhopal, the then capital of Madhya Pradesh .

Chaos i panika wybuchła dookoła małe wioski otaczające roślinę, pierwszą reakcją było duszenie, pieczenie oczu, kaszel, wymioty i zaburzenia widzenia.

Kiedy dane śmierci z powodu tragedii gazu przekroczył 21.000 rząd przestał utrzymanie rejestrów śmierć za zmarłych. Even after 33 years of tragedy, the victims were not adequately compensated by Dow Chemicals who owned Union Carbide of India and the Government of India also a stake holder turned a blind eye to the sufferers. Day in and day out, the victims who lost their fathers, mothers, sons and daughters fighting for the compensation. Rachna Dhingra of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action said, “Recent scientific studies show that deaths and diseases attributable to exposure to Union Carbide’s gases continue to occur in Bhopal. Yet, over 80% of the recommendations of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for medical rehabilitation of victims remain to be implemented.” All most 5,00,000 effected by the Bhopal gas leak and nearly 42 settlements with a population of 1,00,000 effected after 2004 with contamination of resources like water and food. Against the recommendation of supreme court a pittance delivered to the victims which is not even sufficient to meet the hospital expneses of victims. Despite innumerable associations and NGOs fighting on behalf of victims to garner sufficient compensation, either state government or central governement are not taking any concrete action to alleviate the aggrieved parties. The human life, emotions, sentiments were took an umbrage by the apathetic attitude of an avaricious Company of a wealthy nation tried to implement its writ on people of poorer sections ofThis picture immediately came into my mind when I saw this question. It is one of the most recognised pictures in the world. It shows a little naked Vietnamese girl crying as she runs towards the camera; she is crying and screaming in agony after a napalm attack incinerated her village, her clothes, and later her skin. It is often the picture that people associate with the slaughter of innocent women and children in the Vietnam War. The little village in South Vietnam was hit by South Vietnamese forces, as it had been reportedly taken over by North Vietnamese forces. Unfortunately, South Vietnam ended up injuring many of its own civilians. However, the story continues. The girl is called Kim Phúc, she was still running when ITN (later BBC) journalist Christopher Wain stopped her and poured water over her while directing his crew to record the terrible scenes. Christopher helped Kim Phúc while his crew continued to capture the horrific scenes. When speaking about the experience he said: \\"We were short of (camera) film and my cameraman, the late, great Alan Downes, was worried that I was asking him to waste precious film shooting horrific pictures which were too awful to use. My attitude was that we needed to show what it was like, and to their lasting credit, ITN ran the shots.\\" Nick Ut then took Kim Phúc and the other injured children that we can see in the picture to the British-run Saigon First Children's Hospital. When she got there it was determined that Kim Phúc’s injuries were so severe that she would need an extensive hospital stay, and would be lucky if she remained alive. In total it is estimated that she stayed in hospital care for 14 months and had 17 surgeries in order to get her into a fit state to return home. It was not until later in 1982, after having treatment in a specialist German clinic that Kim Phúc was able to move fully again. There are lesser known pictures taken by other photographers that show the before and after of the ‘Napalm Girl’ photo, and can be used to further tell the story. Many of them were taken by Alan Downes. a third world country ruthlessly ."},{"instruction":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","output":"Usually, yes.

Which means producers within eight areas: packaging, tires, recycled paper, electronics, batteries, pharmaceuticals, vehicles weighing less than 3.5 tonnes and radioactive radiation sources must have required collection system in place. The other reason is that our whole municipal garbage system is mainly built on recycling. It varies a little from region to region. I can taken an example from my backyard how it works from me. I have three bins that is being collected from my home in intervalls varying biweekly to monthly. To remind me which bin is being collected and when. I get a SMS sent the day before to my mobile phone. Two of these bins are divided in turn to four compartments each so in total I have eight departments to sort my garbage. CardboardColored glassClear glassMetallPlasticPaperFoodNon-sorted trash. Everything except the last compartment Non-sorted trash gets recycled. Left over food gets composted and are sold as fertilizer by our waste disposal company. The gas generating when composting is used as fuel for the city buses and can also be bought at the biogas station for trucks and cars. The non-sorted trash is burned at our local waste incineration plant. Which generates energy and hot water used in our district heating system. My house and most of the buildings in my city is heated that way. The third bin is used optional for home owners and it is where we put waste from the garden ie branches, leaves etc. This is then composted and sold as fertilizer. Lastly if you for instance need to clear out your attic or your garage. You go the the recycling yard. Which looks something like below. As you can see there are lot of different containers where you recycle your garbage. The even changed the rules this year so that you cannot leave non-sorted trash. Everything needs to sorted out and recycled. We do have an old landfill with a mountain of garbage. The gas produced from this old garbage is collected and burnt generating energy. Finally just outside the recycling yard. The waste disposal company has set up a building called Återbruket. Where we for free can leave furniture, home decor, toys, and clothes. This will be picked up by charitables and resold. Allt of these measure results than about 0,7% av all the garbage produced in Sweden is put in landfills. More important is that the total wight of garbage was reduced by 7 kg between 2017–2018 despite a booming economy. Finally Waste Sweden (municipalities' industry organization in waste management) has adopted the so-called 25/25 target, which means that by 2025 the total amount of food and residual waste should have decreased by 25 percent per person, compared with 2015."},{"instruction":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","output":"God no.

Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"Dear OP, You ask a very tough question and one that will, almost by default, be received with great degree of concern and criticism by individuals who, like me and many others, love animals and would not put a healthy pet to sleep. If your parents wish to put a healthy cat to sleep, the criticism and the concern are directed at them, not at you, so I understand how you do wish people who answer not to “shoot the messenger”. Fine, I won't. But I will say that you're 13, not 3, and you're capable of using the Internet and, I would imagine, the phone. Contact a local cat rescue group, a no kill animal shelter, a veterinarian that has good reviews and explain the situation. The problem that your cat has could indicate a variety of conditions -from medical to behavioral- that should be addressed by a vet and that, odds are, are treatable. Some veterinarians will euthanize healthy pets but, in my experience, reputable ones won't. That's even more true when it comes to cats (dogs can be a bit more problematic, but I still find the practice of convenience euthanasia horrifying). If you reach out to any of the places I listed above, odds are, someone will step in and offer to take care of the cat since your parents are clearly not responsible pet owners and should really not have pets. Whatever their reasons for wanting to put to sleep a potentially healthy cat may be, they don't really matter -they should not have the cat. Animal cruelty is against the law in every state, as far as I'm aware, and while I'm not suggesting you call the cops on your parents, you can indeed talk to law enforcement officers, local SPCA divisions etc. Given the fact that you live with your parents and that you're so young, you can definitely request the officers to keep your complaint anonymous. This is a tricky situation that nobody should have to deal with, but it's happening to you and, whether you're 13 or 30, I believe you can be proactive and do everything in your power to save the cat’s life. I wouldn’t normally recommend this, but get the cat out of your parents home if you need to buy time. Hide the cat at a friend’s home (with their family’s permission). Talk to a teacher, school counselor, pastor or bishop or any other adult you trust, and see if they can help. I wish you and the cat the best of luck. I hope some of this helped you a bit.

The relatively slender structure of the Great Wall and its similarity in materials to the surrounding landscape pose challenges in terms of visibility from space. Even at altitudes where spacecraft and space stations orbit Earth (usually between 200 to 400 kilometers), the wall's appearance remains difficult to perceive. Moreover, the scattering of light within Earth's atmosphere affects the clarity of distant objects, and the human eye's resolution falls short of capturing intricate details from a distance. Interestingly, the misconception also implies that the Great Wall is the sole human-made structure visible from space, but this notion is inaccurate. Modern spacecraft equipped with high-powered cameras and zoom capabilities, such as those aboard the International Space Station (ISS), have managed to capture photographs of the Great Wall. However, these images depict the wall as a faint, delicate line that often merges with the landscape. These images emphasize the challenges of discerning such intricate structures from space without specialized equipment. In summary, despite its colossal historical importance, the Great Wall of China cannot be spotted by the naked eye from space. The clarification of this misconception has come about through the progress achieved in space exploration and photography, emphasizing the significance of accurate information in enhancing our comprehension of the world from a celestial perspective.[LINKED_TEXT: see more facts] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/the-enigmatic-human-mind/home] In summary, despite its colossal historical importance, the Great Wall of China cannot be spotted by the naked eye from space.

I) a 1 ton inverter Whirlpool AC ii) a 1.5 ton Haier non inverter AC.","output":"Don't go for non-inverter a/c. If your room is situated at ground floor then go for 1.0 ton DC inverter. All type of 1 ton a/cs consume approximate 1150 watts or 5.0-5.5 amps. DC inverter runs continuously and there's no concept of tripping the unit even after attaining the set room temperature instead it slows down itself and consumes power as low as 400Wh or 1.8 amps hour. If you set your room temperature at 25°C and considering your room size it will take maximum an hour to reach the set temperature and then it will keep that temperature maintained with slow running. On the other hand your 1.5 ton a/c will consume around 8 amps all the time until it reaches the set temperature and shut down itself till the temperature of the room rises one degree above the set temperature and a/c gets restarted but while restarting these old style conventional a/cs give a torque due to their inductive AC motor consuming 3 to 4 times more power than their rated one. So due to extra consumption, they aren't economical at all and only benefit is that they start cooling immediately while inverter A/Cs give slow start. Let's take the example of 2 both types of one ton a/cs which run for 8 hours at night. Both consumes 1.15kWh of power and start working for the same size of room and both reach the set temp in first hour. Type A is conventional and Type B is inverter type After 1 hour A stops completely and restart after 5 minutes and this happens several times with some intervals during running and while restarting it consumes around 3–4kW though for a few seconds and it's total running time could be 6 hours means it consumes 1.15*6=6.9kWh or around 7 units of electricity. While B consumes 1.15kW for the first hour and 400 watts for the rest of 7 hours and its total consumption will be 1.15kWh+ (400W * 7) 2.8kWh = 3.95kWh or 4 units of electricity. I removed all my conventional 1.5 a/cs and have replaced them with 1.0 ton inverter A/Cs."},{"instruction":"What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?","output":"13"},{"instruction":"What are some less known facts about Mars?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Here are some mind-blowing facts about the planet Mars:] [URL: https://sultanblogai.blogspot.com/] Mars is known as the \\"Red Planet\\" because of its reddish appearance, which is due to the presence of iron oxide, or rust, on its surface.Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and is about half the size of Earth.The Martian day, or \\"sol,\\" is slightly longer than a day on Earth, lasting 24 hours and 39 minutes.Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons, which stands at a height of 22 km and has a diameter of 600 km.Mars also has the deepest canyon in the solar system, called Valles Marineris, which is over 4,000 km long and up to 7 km deep.Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and are thought to be captured asteroids.Mars has a thin atmosphere that is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen and argon.

And the same thing goes for homosexual couples, whether gay or lesbian.

Scarlet Witch is one of my favourite charactera and I love Elizabeth Olsen, she could definitely pull of a better acting role than what she has been playing Wanda for most of these movies. She was great in Wind River so her being the leader or even Natasha played by another amazing actress leading a female avengers sounds top notch. Okoye is not my all time favourite but get some other awesome characters like Gamora, Captain Marvel, Wasp and another two awesome actresses playing awesome characters; Valkyrie and Shuri. I’d love to see Shuri become the new Black Panther and Valkyrie maybe becoming the next Thor if Natalie Portman is really out of the MCU. Wanda Maximoff becoming more like her comic book persona and her overpowered powers there would also be great. Mantis should be changed so she can actually do something instead of plot fix/deus ex machina. She should get some ass-kicking powers. Now with that all-star cast and well-defined characters I could definitely watch more than two hours. I can’t wait to see what ideas they could use and maybe a super power female villain like the unused Children of Thanos villain Supergiant or Hela returning. Also, almost forgot about Nebula who’s played by the wonderful Karen Gillan.

Colonel Tarleton with a mix of British Regulars and Loyalist troops had been chasing General Morgan with Continentals plus state and militia troops around South Carolina for a while. Morgan chose the Cowpens as his place to stand and fight. Numbers are anything but firm, but the British had about 1000 men, and the Americans about 400 regulars plus 1000 or so new state troops and militia. No one - British or American officer - believed the militia would stand and fight, making the odds very much in Tarleton’s favor. Morgan knew his opponent, he knew the ground, and he knew his troops. So he set up a screen of riflemen with orders to shoot at officers and then retreat to the militia. He set up the militia with orders to fire two times into the British and retreat behind the Continentals. When the British and Tories reached the Continentals, they were worn down, but still outnumbered the American regulars. A misheard order caused the American right to retreat a bit, and, sensing victory, the British charged. Morgan got the order straightened out, got the men turned around and the line straightened, then let the British have a volley at point blank range, while he sent the cavalry around the British left, and the reforming militia around the British right. Finally, the order was given for the continentals who had just fired to close with bayonets. A near total victory, roughly 200 British Cavalry got away, but almost none of the infantry got off the field before being killed or captured. By asking enough to impact the fighting, but not more than they could bear, General Morgan had used his forces the best he possibly could. Knowing Colonel Tarleton, the British commander, he counted on the man to brashly run into this layered trap. Knowing there was a river just five miles behind them, he counted on that to keep the militia on the field, for being caught crossing a river is a terrible fate. You could argue it was “standard” defense in depth, but it was anything but a standard deployment for the time, and unlike most battles, the Americans held the field at the end of the day, and it changed the way American commanders used militia."},{"instruction":"Why are Tempurpedic beds so expensive?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Buy mattress online ] [URL: https://dreamsonlinestore.in/]has become increasingly popular due to the convenience and wide variety of options available.

A key thing is the fact that the trust you once had is gone. I had always believed I had a perfect life with my loving wife Jane and our two children. We had been married for over a decade and our bond seemed unbreakable. However, very recently I started to notice subtle changes in her behavior that left me feeling very uneasy. Jane used to be open and affectionate, but lately she seemed distant and withdrawn. She would often stay up late, texting on her phone and seemed very anxious when I approached her. She started going out with her friends more using it as an excuse to have some “alone time” and even though I understood the importance of alone time, I just couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was amiss. My suspicions intensified when I noticed her becoming secretive about her phone and social media accounts. She would lock her screen or quickly switch to another app whenever I came near her. I also noticed unfamiliar names popping up in her call logs and messages. To make things worse, our intimate life began to suffer. She seemed disinterested, often avoiding any physical contact and I couldn’t help but wonder if there was someone else in her life. One evening, I made to try to get her phone and she made it very clear that her phone was off limits. She gave a flimsy excuse that I didn’t believe and that made me feel very bad. I decided to get access to her texts and photos using a service(link in bio), without her knowledge and in a few hours got evidence of her infidelity. Her texts and photos said it all. She was indeed having an affair. I also found out that she had gotten an std and transmitted it to me, risking my health and well being while blaming it all on me. Despite the love I had for her, this was a very bad position. It was hard to ignore the deep hurt and the reality that our trust was broken. I didn’t see a way to fix it.

Many soldiers picked up whatever they could get their hands on in Kar98k rifles taken from German soldiers. Many soldiers during WW2 would also come to be fond of the MP38/40 and any time they could get their hands on them they would do so. There were few other more rare German weapons that were sought after and usually picked up if found. The FG42 and both the G41 & G43 were all picked up by Allied soldiers. Though none were used widespread or commonly like the MPs. During the Korean War some battles including at Chosin, units were so overrun and low on supply they had to grab SKSs. And in their case they didnt need to worry much about friendly fire as they were surrounded. In Vietnam there are many many more examples of more widespread use of enemy weapons, regularly and in times of emergency. At Hue City some cutoff Marines had to resort to picking up AK-47s and VZ-57s after running out of ammo, even if it drew friendly fire. The same was true at Khe Sahn. Not to mention all of the Unconventional forces using Warsaw Pact weapons on a General Issue basis, including LRRPs, Army SF, Navy SEALs, Force Recon and Aussie SASR. Can it happen now a days? Sure it can. And that is why many units in Afghanistan do familiarizations training with enemy weapons.

While some bloggers earn a full-time living or significant profits, others might just make a small side income or none at all. Several typical strategies used by bloggers to monetise their blogs include: 1. Advertising: Placing advertisements on your blog either directly from advertisers or through ad networks like Google AdSense. Normally, revenue is produced based on the quantity of clicks or ad impressions. 2. Affiliate marketing is the practice of promoting goods or services while receiving payment for each purchase or action completed using your unique referral link. Amazon Associates, ClickBank, and ShareASale are examples of well-known affiliate schemes. 3. Working with brands or businesses to produce sponsored blog articles or reviews in exchange for money or free goods or services is known as \\"sponsored content.\\" 4.

Most people off the street can learn to use and communicate with ham radio. But as much as we would like to promote it, ham radio is a niche thing, and always has been. This is not meant to be gatekeeping. I have gotten many people interested in the hobby, but I’ve had just as many who were not interested. That’s fine. Technology has provided many ways to just communicate, so that many who would normally adopt ham radio just to talk, no longer need to do that. The two main interests of ham radio operators are—broadly—emergency communications and self-study, research into a great number of radio-releated topics. Many weather spotters, for instance, are hams, who love the adrenalin experience of storm chasing, and the scientific pursuit of meteorology. This is the key. I’m happiest as a ham op, when I can experiment, and learn. That’s more important for enjoying the hobby over the long term. Perhaps this might be you, too."},{"instruction":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","output":"Over time, in business history, successful companies and entrepreneurs have undertaken strategic decisions involving calculated risks to remain competitive and sustain growth. A few of those smart and shrewd maneuvers involve the world’s most notable brands as examples: Apple's product diversification: In the late 1990s, Apple was struggling financially. However, under the leadership of Steve Jobs, the company made a series of smart maneuvers that led to its resurgence. One of the key moves was diversifying its product line beyond computers by introducing the iPod, followed by the iPhone and iPad. These innovative products helped Apple capture new markets and redefine entire industries.Microsoft's strategic partnerships: In the 1980s and 1990s, Microsoft made a series of shrewd maneuvers that helped establish its dominance in the software industry. One of the most notable was securing a deal with IBM to provide the operating system for their personal computers. This partnership allowed Microsoft to distribute its operating system widely, laying the foundation for its eventual dominance in the PC market.Google's acquisition of YouTube: In 2006, Google made a strategic move by acquiring the video-sharing platform YouTube for 1.65 billion. At the time, YouTube was a rapidly growing platform, and this acquisition gave Google a strong foothold in the online video market. Today, YouTube is one of the most popular websites globally and a significant source of revenue for Google.Amazon's introduction of Amazon Prime: In 2005, Amazon launched its subscription service called Amazon Prime, offering customers unlimited two-day shipping for a yearly fee. This move not only improved customer loyalty but also incentivized customers to make more purchases on the platform. Over time, Amazon Prime expanded to include additional benefits like streaming services, creating a comprehensive ecosystem that has contributed to Amazon's remarkable success.Facebook's acquisitions: Facebook has made several notable acquisitions that have helped the company expand its reach and solidify its position as a dominant social media platform. The acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 are two prime examples. These acquisitions allowed Facebook to tap into new user bases and stay ahead of emerging trends in the social media landscape."},{"instruction":"Why do masons show up in a brother's funeral?

When I was learning to drive my family’s 1999 Airstream Land Yacht 355XL, which was 36 feet long, I practiced in an empty parking lot. I took a long about 20 worth of traffic cones purchased from a sporting good store, and practiced setting those out to make a mock turn, and learn when to start steering, etc. Here are some general tips I’ve learned: Remember that steering is totally different than in a car. The steering rate is a lot slower, and when you start steering will be totally different. In a car, you begin turning as you enter the turn. In an RV, you begin turning after you have already entered the turn. This is to allow for swing on the inside. A rule of thumb is to wait until your seat has completely passed the edge of the obstacle or curb, and then begin turning. This feels very unnatural at first, as you will be going straight for much longer before turning, but you need the extra room in an oversize vehicle.Keep your eyes moving. With such a large windshield, and the mirrors being located far away, it is essential to keep your eyes moving and not fixate on one spot. This allows you to be aware of who is around you, so you know when a vehicle is about to enter or leave a blind spot (There are lots of blind spots in an RV!). I know at first, it was easy for me to fixate because I was trying to concentrate too hard. It takes concentration, but try and relax just a little! It really helps with situational awareness.Reduce speed. You simply can’t drive as fast in an oversize vehicle as in a car. I have a travel trailer that I pull with a truck now, but even with this setup, I rarely exceed 60MPH, and never exceed 65. You cannot maneuver or slow down as quickly as smaller vehicles, so you have to reduce speed to allow time to react and maneuver. This is true regardless of experience.Leave yourself plenty of room. In driver’s ed, you were probably taught about the “3-second rule” meaning you should leave 3 seconds of separation between you and the car ahead of you. I like to AT LEAST double this to 6 seconds in an RV. As mentioned above, it just takes longer to stop an RV, no matter what. This can be especially difficult in heavy traffic, but leaving yourself plenty of room is essential in all traffic conditions.Look up. As a normal driver, you probably aren’t used to looking up when driving. In an RV that is probably 11–13 feet tall, you need to look up. Something as small as a stray tree branch could cause thousands of dollars of damage. Find out the height of your rig, including the air conditioner, and any other roof-mounted accessories, and put this height somewhere it is visible from the driver’s seat. I like to add a few inches, just for safety, as well. Pay attention to height indications on bridges. Again I like to leave a few inches to spare there as well. For example, if a bridge says clearance 11′8″, and my RV is 11′6″, I’ll find another route. That’s just too close for comfort.Find out your RV’s weight. Some bridges, especially in rural areas will have weight limits. Knowing the weight of your RV is essential to being able to plan your route, and avoid an accident. Most manufacturers will publish an empty weight, as well as a gross vehicle weight, which is the maximum weight the RV can legally weigh. But, ideally, you should take the RV to a truck scale and get it weighed, so that you know the exact weight you are dealing with.Avoid riding the brakes when going down prolonged grades. In a car, riding the brakes is a bad thing, but you can usually get away with it to some extent because of the relatively light weight of the car. In an RV, riding the brakes will get you into an accident. When going down a long hill, or driving in the mountains, downshift to allow the engine’s compression to slow you down. If you have to brake, brake down to your desired speed, and then release the brake, and let the speed creep back up, and repeat. This allows your brakes to cool.Planning stops. Planning stops for fuel, food, etc. can be a little more difficult in an RV. Gas stations in particular can be problematic. If you are on an interstate, look for truck stops. Even the gasoline pumps usually have extra space around them, and, if you drive a diesel coach, you can probably use the truck lanes, which always have plenty of room, obviously. Just don’t tie up the fuel pump in a truck lane any longer than necessary! If I’m concerned about fuel in a particular area, I may even research ahead of time on Google Maps to make sure there is a gas station with enough space.When parking, take it slow. Use a spotter if at all possible. If you don’t have a spotter, practice the GOAL principle (Get Out And Look). Don’t be afraid to get out and check several times during the parking process to make sure you have adequate clearance. It’s easy to miss an obstacle, especially when backing up. If you have a spotter, make sure they know to stand somewhere where you can see them, and they can see you. Two-way radios may be helpful for parking, as it may be difficult to hear each other. These are just some of the driving tips I have learned in my relatively limited experience with RVs. Practice makes perfect. Find an empty parking lot and practice driving around with your RV for a bit until you feel comfortable, that way when you hit the open road, you’ll be ready, and you’ll be confident in you and your rig’s abilities!"},{"instruction":"there an affordable webbased small business accounting software?","output":"Yes, here is available lots of affordable web-based small business [LINKED_TEXT: accounting software] [URL: https://www.softwaresuggest.com/us/accounting-software].

The house doesn't get too dirty since I'm home all day but 99% of the cleaning gets done by me or by my helpful 6 year old. The cleaning gets done during the day, not in the evening. Our 6 month old is our trouble baby (our other two were amazingly well behaved and happy babies), so she's usually having a fit or being disruptive in which case my husband will get pajamas on our 3 year old and get that bedroom “bedtime” ready, or he will help them out of the bath or wipe a bum (if the baby is in a foul mood). If the baby is behaving, I do it all. We each get a sleep in day on the weekend, which (usually) will be the only time my husband prepares breakfast for the kids or changes a diaper. (He gets up at 6am and is at work by 7am, he's usually back at 6pm and the kids go to bed at 8pm).

So if I NEED help, he usually will (with the kids not so much with the chores). But for the most part, I don't need the help. The only thing I wish I got was more personal time (not having to rush a bath or shower because he can't alway handle the baby or to give me an hour 3 times a week to work out). But when he usually only has 3 hours at home before he falls asleep, I can't be too upset over it. But I do get a bit jaded when he falls asleep on the couch, showered and in pjs while I'm trying to get the baby down (with me usually not showered or in pjs yet and with bottles that have to ben cleaned before bed). I usually end up going to bed 2 hours after he falls asleep (to which I wake him up and we go to bed together, but would be handy if he would wash bottles before he falls asleep)."},{"instruction":"What are some first date tips?","output":"Choose the right location, one that is comfortable and enjoyable for both you and your date.

In Job 1, you have a well built building and your role is to look for repairs, if any and do some cosmetic fixes and you might not have much of an autonomy or say in things. In Job 2, you have a new site that is unbuilt and it is a very exciting site. There are plenty of interesting challenges and opportunities and it is a geography you understand. If money is the big problem for you, you might pick Job 1. Once money ceases to be the sole problem you might gravitate to Job 2. In US or Europe, we don’t have much of a role.

When I mentioned that I want to move to the UK, her response was “Ooh, that’s not too far from northern Europe! We could take a trip to Norway from there!” She’s studying abroad right now with a month to go and she told me “I don’t want to leave here, but I can’t wait to hang out with you.” No matter how far apart we are, she keeps planning herself into my life. At the same time, though, we can go for days without talking. She was gone for a month with no internet or phone service and when she finally got back to civilization, she texted me like nothing had ever changed. We can tell each other anything. I can say things like “I almost wet the bed last night” and “I think guys with mustaches can be incredibly attractive” and “Want to hear the world’s only placenta joke?” And I know she won’t judge me… not too harshly, anyway. We can talk about gossip and neuroscience and our dreams and geology and Hamilton all without pause. There’s nothing we can’t share. We laugh. We cry. We eat large amounts of Taco Bell. We stay friends no matter how many time zones apart we are or how many days we go without speaking. We can be completely honest with one another and there’s no doubt it comes from love. We keep planning ourselves into each other’s lives. That, to me, is a true friend. One who isn’t a friend out of convenience but out of devotion. One who stays your friend even when it’s difficult or when the geography doesn’t line up. One who wants to be around you, and is willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

It would belong to the homeowner and be sold by them to the next homeowner. If it did belong to the HOA then it would be sold by them to the new homeowner meaning the HOA would no longer have any interest in the house due to the fact they no longer own it. (I don’t know American law and this is just my opinion and I’m glad we don’t have HOA’s in NZ) I find it amazing that in a country that touts its freedom at every opportunely that residents allow their neighbours dictate how they live on their own property, sounds more like North Korea to me."},{"instruction":"What is a way that you can make a fake survey?","output":"Gee, I dunno.

We judge people on their appearance all the time. When we first encounter someone we make an instant judgement about that person based on what we see. It does not matter if we are liberal, conservative, black, white, yellow, red or pink with green stripes. [LINKED_TEXT: How We Are Judged by Our Appearance] [URL: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/subliminal/201206/how-we-are-judged-our-appearance] - a great article that says a lot. But what you are really asking is if I have had a negative experience because of someones judgement on my appearance? And the answer to that is a resounding yes. Because I have always been a little larger than most, people have always assumed that I am a bully (I am not, I cannot stand bullies). During my school years everyone also assumed that I was interested in the more physical sports (rugby, boxing etc), rather than intellectual pursuits. When I tried to express my love of reading and dislike of violence, people would look at me with a dumbfounded look on their face. It led to me getting bullied, I was called many names that signified a social rejection from groups, all because I did not conform to a preconception of what I should be. It led to a very hard time in school (thankfully I have some excellent friends who I met outside of school). Even today, I have issues with people judging me on my looks. One of the more interesting judgement calls I get is African-Americans automatically assuming I am a racist because of my size and skin color (6ft 3, overweight and white). And this is before I have even opened my mouth to say “Hi”. So yes, I have been judged for my appearance in a negative way before and suffered because of it. Today I just shake my head and get on with life, what other people think of me is of no matter. If they are willing to see past the outside, then I will welcome all who are friendly into my circle."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","output":"In the United States, you write a thesis for your Masters and a dissertation for your PhD."},{"instruction":"What would happen if a megalodon attacked a Ohio class submarine or any other nuclear sub?","output":"I have no idea… but I would *definitely* watch the movie."},{"instruction":"'m facing with this awkward situation where my 400 watt incandescent bulbs burn out at a crazy rate.

Huskies are very high maintenance, and people simply don’t bother to do their research and consider whether their living situation and lifestyle might be compatible before buying one. They are bred to pull sleds all day long; they are thus very energetic with very high levels of stamina, and thus require a lot of walking. The UK Kennel club advises at least two hours of walking a day, preferably more; and also advises that you vary your walking routes due to the second point. Restless dogs are a nuisance, and often a destructive nuisance.They are very intelligent. The more intelligent a species (or indeed individual) is, the more mental stimulation they need. Huskies get bored easily, and bored dogs also tend to get destructive. If your dog is chewing furniture and shoes to pieces it is probably just bored.Intelligent dogs also tend to be rather independently minded, which can make them difficult to train. You have to work quite hard to keep their attention and make them learn- though if you can do that, they learn very well. Many people find training a husky more work than they can commit to.This independent bloody-mindedness also means they have famously poor recall when off the lead- if whatever they’re doing is more interesting than you, then they ain’t coming back until they’re ready.As a breed they tend to get wander lust, and their intelligence and ability to jump really bloody high means they are quite capable of escaping from the average garden- and they do, quite frequently.They are arctic dogs, so they have a very thick undercoat which is shed twice a year. They moult a lot. They thus require a lot of grooming, and can make a real mess of your house.They have a high prey drive, and will chase almost anything that is furry and smaller than they are.They have a strong pack mentality. This, almost counter-intuitively, means they can be aggressive towards other dogs- dogs with a strong pack mentality need a clear hierarchy, so are more likely to get into dominance fights. It also means that if with a group of dogs which they accept, they can be a real nuisance. It is a simple truth that dogs in packs tend to egg each other on.They’re also rather aloof towards strangers. Again this seems to be a consequence of a strong pack mentality- you, as the owner, and your family are their pack. Anyone else is an outsider. They’re not unfriendly, exactly, but people whose understanding of dog behaviour is based exclusively on interaction with waggy spaniels and friendly golden retrievers still tend to struggle with this aspect of the husky character. So as I said, they’re high-maintenance. Huskies are wonderful dogs, but owning one is a lifestyle choice. Sadly, many people do not properly research breeds before buying, and even fewer bother to learn anything about canine behaviour and psychology. People will often buy a husky because they are a rather beautiful breed, only to become dismayed when their dog becomes destructive and aggressive. So they get rid of it, without ever realising that it’s behaviour is their own fault- a properly exercised, stimulated, and trained husky would not have acted in the same way. Top tip- if you want a dog, research dogs, and research breeds, before you buy one. You will avoid disappointment, and avoid adding another unwanted dog to the world."},{"instruction":"Which Bollywood movie has a very effective, well crafted, and brilliant climax scene?","output":"Sarfarosh undoubtedly.

I am using Advik Ayurveda Aloe Vera gel with vitamin E, which is safe to apply on the face overnight because it is made of natural ingredients and does not contain any harmful chemicals. Aloe Vera has anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe the skin, while its moisturizing effect can help hydrate the skin. Moreover, the Vitamin E present in the gel helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, leaving your skin smooth and supple. Applying the gel overnight allows it to penetrate deep into the skin and work its magic while you sleep, resulting in a brighter, healthier-looking complexion in the morning."},{"instruction":"Why have there been so few images been released from the James Web Space Telescope?

Versatility is a great quality to have as you go through life but in a courtroom the word of law matters more than its presentation. A lawyer will save you time and money. I was once a juror in a landlord-tenant dispute. The landlord represented himself and it was painful to watch.

Keep making a product as long as the profits can employ at least one full time engineer. Keep releasing new versions regularly. A okay product will be profitable enough to keep releasing updates. Think of the same model of car improving year to year, though I learned it as releases of software packages and my electronics friends learned it as newer faster models of anything from EEPROM burners on. A good product will employ enough engineers to expand into an entire product line. Think regular passenger cars of many sizes. Or an FPLA programmer to complement that EEPROM programmer. A great product will employee enough engineers to expand into new product lines. Now we build pick up trucks. Now vans. Let’s invent the minivan. Let’s make cross overs. All the while technology in general advances. Older products are objectively worse so they don’t sell as well. Old cars rarely latest 100K miles. I’ve had 3 cars in a row last twice that. Old cars polluted more. Now I have a hybrid. Old cars had a clock radio. Now I’ve got an okay navigation system."},{"instruction":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","output":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous) ? Credit: Arthur Sasse/AFP/Getty Images At the time the photo was taken, Sasse had been attempting to get the Nobel Prize-winning physicist to smile, but instead he stuck out his tongue as he sat in the back seat of a car. As it turned out, Einstein liked the shot so much he had some prints made for himself. While many people did not know, Einstein had given the print to outspoken journalist Howard K. Smith, with the inscription (translated from German): “This gesture you will like, because it is aimed at all of humanity. A civilian can afford to do what no diplomat would dare. Your loyal and grateful listener, A. Einstein.” Einstein spoke out against McCarthyism, and historians have said the gesture in the photo and its inscription represent his spirit of non-conformity.

Navy lens man Victor Jorgensen also happened to get a shot of the impromptu kiss, from a different (and less famous) angle. Neither photographer got a chance to ask the smooching pair their names (as Eisenstaedt later said of that day: “There were thousands of people milling around… everybody was kissing each other”), and in the years that followed, a number of men and several women came forward to claim they were the ones in the photos, which became symbolic of the excitement felt at the end of the war. A 2012 book, “The Kissing Sailor,” identified the couple as sailor George Mendonsa and Greta Zimmer, a dental assistant who didn’t know Mendonsa at the time of his spontaneous smooch. However, other people have made credible claims that they were the lip-locked couple, and to date, the pair’s identity never has been definitively proven.

Richard Nixon & Elvis Presley, 1970, White House On December 21, 1970, the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll secretly met with the nation’s 37th president in the Oval Office, an event documented by White House photographer Ollie Atkins. The meeting came about after Presley showed up unannounced at the White House gates earlier that morning and dropped off a hand-written letter of introduction for the president stating he wanted to be of service to the country and suggesting he be made a “Federal Agent-at-Large” to help fight America’s war on drugs. After the letter found its way into the hands of a Nixon aide, Presley was ushered in to meet the president that afternoon. During the get-together, the entertainer reiterated his wish to be helpful to the president, shared his belief that the Beatles promoted anti-Americanism and s aid he’d been studying Communist brainwashing and the drug culture. Presley, who collected guns and police badges, then asked Nixon if he could get him a federal narcotics agent badge, a request that was granted later that day. Also at Presley’s request, his confab with the commander-in-chief was kept under wraps and the media didn’t learn about it until the following year. In 1977, the music legend, who never ended up working with the White House, died of heart failure, suspected to have been related to his abuse of prescription drugs [LINKED_TEXT: Source] [URL: https://www.history.com/news/the-fascinating-stories-behind-8-famous-photos] Thank you for reading, check the sources if needed."},{"instruction":"Should recordkeeping be required on all ammunition sales in the USA?","output":"Gun control activists have little or no knowledge of current or past firearm laws and this is just another example.

There are many common foods that dogs should not eat. Rather than go nuts trying to remember what mine can or cannot eat, I almost NEVER give them “people” food. On a special occasion, I might buy some turkey dog food, but that’s it. It is really never a good idea to feed animals from the table anyway.

They are generally larger than 3 cm in diameter. Species is Citrus x latifolia, a hybrid of double dose of aurantifolia and single dose of Citrus x limon (lemon). There are also limes of the same species as key limes which are larger (3–5 cm) than what are marketed as key limes. These are also round, but have a knob on the blossom end, and have the purer lime aroma of Persian limes. I have Edited this based on a Comment from Kivi Lansimaki of Helsinki, a peek at Wikipedia, and a trip to our best supermarket, HEB, near San Antonio. I checked the sizes of the three fruits marketed here as Limes with a ruler borrowed from the school supplies aisle, grades 6–8. All key limes marked as such were grown in México, and packed in Ciudad Victoria. The ones marked simply Limes were shipped from the Lower Rio Grande valley, Texas.

The ancient Hebrews also used a seven-day week, and it is believed that this tradition was passed down to other cultures through the Hebrew calendar. However, other civilizations used different systems for measuring time. For example, the ancient Egyptians used a ten-day week, while the ancient Romans used an eight-day week. The concept of a standard seven-day week didn't become widespread until the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire, where the seven-day week was adopted due to its association with the Christian Sabbath. Today, the seven-day week is widely used around the world and has become a standard part of our modern calendar."},{"instruction":"want to use C++ to learn Machine Learning instead of Python or R, is it fine?","output":"C should be your choice if you want to know what is under the hood, want to implement your own new ideas and algorithms If you just want to practice machine learning as state of the art tool, try to find higher level wrappers"},{"instruction":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

You can’t change it. But preventing water in the pipes from freezing is in your power. Here are some things you can do: 1. Disconnect outdoor hoses. If any water is left inside, it can back up into the pipes, freeze, and cause them to burst. Not only does that ruin the pipes, but it can also lead to further water damage and mold problems. 2. Set to a temperature no lower than 55° F. 3. Inspect for any areas of your home with leaks that allow cold air to enter. Look around at-risk areas like electrical wiring, pipes, and dryer vents. Seal the leaks and prevent the cold air from entering by using caulk or insulation. Remember, in extremely cold weather conditions, even the tiniest opening can allow cold air into your home that can freeze your pipes.

Here are some steps you can take to increase your chances of success: Write your novel: This may seem obvious, but the first step to becoming an official novelist is to actually write your novel. It's important to put in the time and effort to create a well-written, compelling story that will capture the attention of readers and publishers.Revise and edit: Once you've finished your novel, it's important to revise and edit it thoroughly. This will help to ensure that your story is polished and ready for publication.Research agents and publishers: Find out which agents and publishers are looking for novels in your genre. Look for those that are accepting unsolicited submissions and check their guidelines for submission requirements.Query agents and publishers: Reach out to agents and publishers by sending them a query letter that includes a brief summary of your novel, your background and publishing history, and a sample of your writing (usually the first chapter of your novel).Be patient: Getting a novel published can be a long process. It may take a while to find the right agent or publisher, and even after you've found one, it can take several months or even years for your novel to be published.Network: Attend writing conferences, join writing groups and organizations, and engage with other writers online to build connections and learn more about the publishing industry.Self-publishing: If you are not able to find a traditional publisher, self-publishing is an option. Self-publishing platforms such as [LINKED_TEXT: Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing] [URL: https://amzn.to/3XItMe5] and Smashwords allow you to publish your book and make it available to readers worldwide.Keep writing: Even if your first novel isn't accepted by a publisher, continue to write and improve your craft. Many successful authors have had multiple rejections before getting their work published. Keep writing and honing your skills, and don't give up on your dream of becoming an official novelist. It's also important to keep in mind that getting a novel published doesn't necessarily mean that you will become a best-selling author overnight. It takes hard work, persistence, and a bit of luck to become successful in the publishing industry. But with dedication and perseverance, you can increase your chances of getting your novel published and becoming an official novelist."},{"instruction":"Can you take control of your blood sugar?","output":"Here are some tips to help you take control of your blood sugar: Let's start by focusing on your diet. It's important to nourish your body with a variety of delicious and healthy foods. Fill your plate with colorful fruits and vegetables, lean proteins like chicken or fish, and whole grains such as brown rice or quinoa. These choices provide essential nutrients and can help keep your blood sugar stable.Remember that portion control plays a significant role. It's not about depriving yourself but rather enjoying your favorite foods in moderation. By paying attention to portion sizes, you can savor the flavors you love while keeping your blood sugar levels in check.I encourage you to explore low glycemic index (GI) foods. These include foods like sweet potatoes, lentils, and leafy greens. They are digested more slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar instead of sudden spikes. Incorporating these foods into your meals can help you maintain more stable blood sugar levels throughout the day.Let's make a conscious effort to reduce sugary beverages in your routine. Swap out sodas or sugary juices for refreshing options like infused water, unsweetened tea, or sparkling water with a slice of lemon or cucumber. By cutting back on sugary drinks, you can better manage your blood sugar and promote overall health.Fiber is your friend when it comes to blood sugar control. Incorporate high-fiber foods into your diet, such as whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and legumes. Fiber slows down the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, helping to prevent sharp spikes and maintaining a more balanced blood sugar level.Let's get moving! Regular physical activity not only helps manage blood sugar levels but also improves your overall well-being. Find activities you enjoy, whether it's taking a brisk walk, dancing, swimming, or playing a sport. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, and remember to include strength training exercises to keep your body strong.Managing stress is an essential part of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Find activities that help you relax and unwind, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or pursuing hobbies that bring you joy. Taking care of your mental and emotional well-being can positively impact your blood sugar control.Prioritize a good night's sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Lack of sleep can disrupt your body's insulin sensitivity and affect your blood sugar levels. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine and create a comfortable sleep environment to promote restful sleep.If you have diabetes, closely monitoring your carbohydrate intake can be beneficial. Work with a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, who can help you determine the right amount of carbohydrates to include in your meals and snacks.Lastly, always follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding medications and treatments for blood sugar control. They are there to support you and provide guidance specific to your needs. Personal recommendation : [LINKED_TEXT: Ground-breaking Blood Sugar and Sleep Support] [URL: https://0e8757q76vfva5ufmhsbwg3-46.hop.clickbank.net/] Remember, you're not alone on this journey.

I try real real hard not to put anything in my body that I either can’t spell nor pronounce. Hence, this “speed” which purportedly works for ADHD has side effects. IMHO, worse than cannabis. [weed]. I disagree w/ the doc. Don’t know where he’s gettin’ his info, but it is a tad out-dated and off the mark. “Vyvanse is a federally controlled substance (CII) because it can be abused or lead to dependence. Keep Vyvanse in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. Selling or giving away Vyvanse may harm others and is against the law.” It’s what’s called a Schedule 2 drug with really dangerous drugs: Vicodin [tranquilizer] Cocaine, Meth, Dilaudid, Oxycotin [brand name of the Pharma drug that started the opiate epidemic: the CEO was just charged!], Fentanyl, Adderall and Ritalin [both prescribed for the same reason, ADHD] Personally, if I were you, I would ask my doc, but don’t be surprised if he doesn’t know. Ask those around you, their experience. It can be different for many people, however, there are usually common denominators.

The STM is basically a needle with a point that is a single atom (literally, it is the pointiest thing possible) which it uses to measure subtle electrical variations (such as a stray atom sitting on what was otherwise a very flat, clean surface). The “Tunneling Electron” bit of the name refers to the nature of the electrical interaction being used to detect the presence of atoms; when the tip is brought close to electric field electricity will go through between them and the exchange of electric field vibrations is a detectable as a current. The “Scanning” bit of the name refers to how this is used to generate a picture: by scanning back and forth across a surface over and over until you’ve bumped every atom with your needle several times. The pictures so generated aren’t photographs, they’re maps of what the STM’s needle experienced as it was moved over the surface. The STM “sees” atoms using this needle in the same way you can “see” the bottom of a muddy river with a pokin’ stick-IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON’T OBSERVE ATOMS AT ALL, SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT EXACTLY YOU ARE OBSERVING AT ALL. Generally these kind of atomic microscopy techniques measure either (AFM) electrical density or (STM) electrical current, so what you're actually seeing in these images are where electric charge is localized-you do not observe the existence of atoms themselves. I forgot to add that what exactly is visualized with all these microscopes including STM, What is visualized is the charge density of the electric field.Basically you observe vibrations-electric vibrations.You haven’t seen an atom either. You’ve seen an image you assume to be an atom but it is simply an instrument’s representation of the atom. It is not the atom itself. Those aren’t actual ATOMS… That is the representation of THE effects (measurements) of something we cannot study its physical properties. The main problerm is that they do not know what they exactly observe-they observe something, but despite all of the observations they do not know what exactly they observe-since their observational abilities are extremely limited. This is why I posted above about the thing about reality with indian story example:but like in a true indian story that I posted above when blind man touched elephant’s ear he thought that it was a leaf-the same thing is repeated when you cannot observe anything but you simply say that is is molecule, particle or whatever the math shows, but it is wrong the same as blind man is wrong when he says that he touched leaf and actually it was elephant’s ear and that’s because blind people can never actually observe elephant, the same as scientists who are also blind and 100% wrong when it comes to the size of the universe and quantum mechanics say they have observed particles, expansions, molecules atoms, subatomic particles and etc.-they say the same thing as the blind man says when he touched elephant’s ear and thought it was a leaf-the same equally blind scientists claim the same about everything they are doing experiments with. What really is proven it is proven mathematically, and nothing more in experiments you can never prove anything, since we can barely scratch the surface of the objective reality when it comes to perception and that’s why everything is 100% wrong when it comes to explanation since scientists can only observe a very, very tiny piece of objective reality, and because of these facts you can never see the entire objective reality, and if you can never see/observe the entire objective reality all the hypotheses that we have are 100% wrong-facts. An ultrasound picture of a baby accurately reflects the actual form of the baby. A Scanning Tunneling Electron Microscope does not accurately reflect the form of an atom because it simply uses an artificial dot to represent the presence or absence of an atom. In short, the \\"map\\" that STM's give us is abstracted from reality and does not accurately portray an atom (in large part because STM's still simply due not measure at the scale of an atom). There's a philosophy idea that in order to say we can \\"see\\" something, we have to be able to collect consistent information by several different methods. For example if all we have is a STM, then we don't know which parts of the image are artifacts and which are real so we haven't seen anything. But if we have an STM and crystallography, we can have more faith in the features that are common to both images - such as interatomic distances and the geometry of crystal structure. But we still couldn't say that we've seen the shape of an atom since that would look different in each instrument's image and we still don't know what is artifact and what is real, since when it comes to these levels none knows what is real and what is an artifact-all we can know that they are energy fields, but they are definitely NOT particles. In order to know they are particles you need to study them thoroughly by direct observations and/or simply shrink down to quantum levels and see for ourselves how truly and how exactly the quantum level universe truly looks like and how exactly it exists and how is it created in the first place. The problem with what we think are atoms are exactly about the shorter wavelengths-sure shroter wavelengths hit something, but what is it?You cannot know what it is because of the reasons I posted above-like the example I gave above: A great example is people who “discovered” lost cities under the sea. They saw regular patterns of lines on the seafloor in Google Earth and interpreted them as ancient roads or walls. But they were only seeing artifacts from ships that had sailed back and forth in straight lines collecting data. If they had looked both at those sonar scans and some other data for the same location, they would have only seen the lines on one image and been able to conclude that they were either an artifact of the sonar or below the level of sensitivity of the other instrument. So, no, scanning tunneling microscopes and atomic force microscopes did not prove at all the existence of atoms and molecules. But this isn’t really a “picture” in the sense that it’s what you’d see with a really powerful lens. It’s not made with light, and you can’t “see” it in the usual sense. This is really more a visualization of the data, one that happens to conform very nicely to the mathematical model, but it’s misleading to think that it really “looks” like that and that it is actually proven to exist.This is why you would never be able to prove the existence of atoms, small electrons or any other particle for that matter. Of course, none of these things ‘prove’ that atoms are anything other than a ‘useful mathematical model’. But then you have to start delving deep into epistemology and the nature of the relationship between our knowledge of the world and the reality of it. For all practical purposes, our mathematical models in which atoms play an important role have such a powerful predictive value that it’s kind of ridiculous philosophical hair-splitting to debate whether or not they exist. However it’s not predicitve on what models say about atoms and electrons, but only on what it can be tested and directly observed in experiments-and atoms and electrons and similar cannot be tested and directly observed to exist in the first place-so the model prediction-where model is describing and predicting the atom, atomic nuclei, electrons and all other subatomic particles and their behaviours on quantum levels, simply fail because models that describe and rpedict atoms and all other particles and their behaviours on quantum levels are 100% untestable and unprovable, what is predictive is only what you can directly observe and test in/inside experiments-facts. Also, how do we know that atoms aren’t just features of computer simulation-atoms do not exist. It’s just that I think a lot of people have a hard time making the leap from ‘this mathematical model says these things exist’ to ‘these exist’. Heck, the neutrino and the quark are modern day examples of actual working physicists having this issue, particles are just mathematical mumbo-jumbo. Of course, as the model required to describe them became more and more integral physicists decided they “existed”. However with atoms and all mentioned and all other particles that are not mentioned, this combination does not work at all, since you do not know what exactly is real when you directly observe with Scanning Tunneling Microscopes and even if it’s real you cannot say at all or even assume if it’s actually anything at all that you are directly observing it or is it something entirely else that we know nothing about. Basically the only thing they have actually seen is basically computer image not the real image, and second, they observe electric field, not the particle itself-they do not observe particles themselves, they are able to observe only the field-however this alone does not prove anything but that electric energy field exists and that's about it-no atoms, no photons, no electrons, no quarks. no nothing, so no particles do not exist-particles exist only inside mathematical abstractions and nothing more and nothing else-we don't know what actually exists in the real world, except that they are energy fields-electric, magnetic and all other forms and all other kinds of energy fields. What you call particles are actually invisible energy fields-when you show these “photos” you actually show the interactions of carbon monoxide functionalised tips and similar stuff, you don’t observe the atoms-the best what you can know is that shorter wavelengths hit that invisible energy field-NOT the atom itself, because there is no such thing as atoms, protons and there is no such thing as particles at all. Similar example is when radiation that is invisible hit Earth’s magnetic field-and both of them are invisible, and when you see northern and southern plar lights it is not because you observed Earth’s magnetic field, it’s because you observed the radiation that hit the magnetic field and interaction with oxygen-it is the oxygen that is visible, not radiation and energy fields-that’s a key difference, exactly the same thing is with “observing” atoms-there is no such thing you do not observe atoms, because there are no atoms, you only observe interactions between gases and all other periodic elements-not the atom itself, the only thing you can know that these periodic elements interact with energy field (electric field-and that’s what you actually observe-not the atom itself-because there is no such thing as atom, and not the electric field itself-with the exception that electric, magnetic, electromagnetic fields exist on all levels-because you observe their effects and interactions with other elements, NOT BECAUSE ATOMS EXIST-that also includes all quantum levels!"},{"instruction":"What places in San Francisco do celebrities hang out?","output":"They stay away from the huge parts of the city where you have to watch to not step in human waste on the sidewalks."},{"instruction":"My therapist told me that I have to form a healthy relationship with myself before I can love others in a healthy manner?

And if you are being shot at by a mortar, you should probably just dig a deeper and more secure position and get ready for an attack. If you are attacking and getting shot at by mortars, you are probably in the enemy’s engagement area, and should already have a plan on what to do. The most precise way is to look at the impact markings that the shells leave, especially if you see a dud round hit or skip. Mortars are primarily designed to be employed using a high angle of fire. So even though it seems like rounds are dropping vertically from the sky they still have a horizontal velocity. This means when they strike the ground, they will create a splash pattern that will indicate where the fire is coming from: The full array of techniques can be found [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-50/Appj.htm]. And it looks like it takes a lot of training and time to be proficient at this skill. To be completely honest, having taken IDF before, no one is pulling out stakes and going NCIS on craters when lead is falling from the sky. Everyone will begin a prayer to their maker and get ready for the enemy to attack. Since we are talking about mortar systems, the range is going to be no further than about 8 km (5 miles). If you have prepared your defensive position ahead of time, then you have already guessed where the enemy might set up indirect assets. You should also have observation points that can call IDF on those positions (or others) to limit the enemy’s ability to reach out and touch you. If your observers don’t see the indirect asset get emplaced, mortars still expel gases when firing, so they may be able to see the firing position from that indicator as well. The last thing to mention is that if you have a counter-battery radar ([LINKED_TEXT: Counter-battery radar - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-battery_radar]) asset, then the job of finding where indirect fire is coming from is much easier. These can usually be connected directly to the fire direction center and produce counter-battery mission data for the gunline directly. — After getting out of the Marine Corps, I have begun a career in Christian Ministry.

It facilitates communication by forwarding client requests to other servers and returning the responses back to the clients. Here's an explanation of how a proxy server works: Client Sends a Request: A client, such as a web browser, sends a request to access a resource (web page, file, or any other content) hosted on a server. Instead of directly connecting to the server, the client sends the request to the proxy server.Proxy Server Receives the Request: The proxy server receives the client's request, which typically includes the URL and other relevant information.Proxy Server Evaluates the Request: The proxy server evaluates the request and performs various tasks based on its configuration and purpose. These tasks may include filtering content, caching responses, improving performance, enhancing security, or enforcing access control policies.Proxy Server Forwards the Request: If the requested content is not available in its cache, the proxy server establishes a connection with the target server that hosts the requested resource. It then forwards the client's request to the target server on behalf of the client.Target Server Processes the Request: The target server, which could be a web server or any other type of server, receives the request from the proxy server as if it came directly from the client. It processes the request and generates a response.Proxy Server Receives the Response: The proxy server receives the response from the target server and performs additional actions based on its configuration. This may include caching the response for future requests or modifying the response as required.Proxy Server Sends the Response to the Client: Finally, the proxy server sends the response back to the client that initiated the request. The client receives the response as if it came directly from the target server. By acting as an intermediary, a proxy server offers several benefits, such as: Caching: Proxy servers can cache frequently accessed resources, storing a copy locally. This reduces the load on target servers and improves response times for subsequent requests.Content Filtering: Proxy servers can filter and block certain types of content based on predefined rules. This allows organizations to enforce content policies and restrict access to inappropriate or malicious content.Anonymity and Privacy: Proxy servers can provide anonymity for clients by masking their IP addresses. This can be useful for bypassing geo-restrictions or protecting privacy.Load Balancing: Proxy servers can distribute client requests across multiple servers, optimizing resource utilization and improving overall performance and scalability.Security: Proxy servers can act as a security barrier by inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic, filtering out malicious content, and providing an additional layer of protection against threats. Overall, a proxy server acts as a gateway between clients and servers, enhancing performance, security, and control over network traffic."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","output":"The Mission One series is an awesome Science Fiction series and it’s Free on Amazon!

Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock that is made up of recrystallized carbonate minerals, usually calcite or dolomite.Appearance: Granite is typically speckled, with a range of colors and patterns, depending on the minerals that make up the rock. Marble, on the other hand, often has a distinctive veined appearance, with swirls of contrasting colors.Durability: Most people think that granite is more durable than marble because it is harder and less likely to scratch or stain. Marble is more susceptible to damage from acids, such as those found in many common household cleaners.Granite is often used for countertops, floors, and outdoor projects, while marble is often used for decorative things like sculptures, fireplaces, and high-end countertops.Price: In general, granite is cheaper than marble, but prices can vary based on the stone's quality and rarity.

Crocodilians are ectothermic, meaning that they rely upon the environment to change their body temperature. This means crocodilians tire quickly after using expulsive amounts of energy and it takes a while to gain it back. Theropods are mesotherms, meaning they are both cold and warm blooded [LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #CZHRa]. They won’t tire out as relatively fast in comparison to cold blooded organisms. If Spinosaurus can exhaust Deinosuchus without getting bit, it would have the edge. Jaguars regularly exploit this when they hunt caiman. That’s not including the massive arms with long fingers and claws would allows for a strong grip.(NOVA. 2014. Spinosaurus closeup skeletal reconstruction. National geographic) The Victor? Despite lacking armor and a weaker skull, Spinosaurus might be too much for Deinosuchus to take, on land at least. Spinosaurus wasn’t as terrestrial either, but it seems better equipped here plus a possible size advantage gives it the win. Even in water, it isn’t one sided in favor of the gator as Spinosaurus also was well adapted for a semiaquatic lifestyle [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #wVNgz]. At that point, it depends on who grabs who and how good of a swimmer Spinosaurus is. It’s maybe a 50/50, at for now until we learn more about the aquatic ability of Spinosaurus.Footnotes [LINKED_TEXT: [1] ] [URL: #cite-HYpUA][LINKED_TEXT: How the ‘terror crocodile’ grew so big - Nature] [URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/18343#%3A~%3Atext%3DDeinosuchus%20is%20a%20giant%20crocodylian%2CCretaceous%20period%20of%20North%20America.%26text%3DWe%20find%20that%20growth%20indices%2Cwere%20attained%20by%20prolonging%20development.][LINKED_TEXT: [2] ] [URL: #cite-yYqaa][LINKED_TEXT: Vertebrae-Based Body Length Estimation in Crocodylians and Its Implication for Sexual Maturity and the Maximum Sizes] [URL: https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/2/1/obaa042/5999807][LINKED_TEXT: [3] ] [URL: #cite-MVFzT][LINKED_TEXT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flZOQMHUCPY] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flZOQMHUCPY][LINKED_TEXT: [4] ] [URL: #cite-CuyEk][LINKED_TEXT: The ‘death roll’ of giant fossil crocodyliforms (Crocodylomorpha: Neosuchia): allometric and skull strength analysis] [URL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08912963.2014.893300?journalCode=ghbi20][LINKED_TEXT: [5] ] [URL: #cite-aWCVm][LINKED_TEXT: King of the Crocodylians] [URL: https://iupress.org/9780253340870/king-of-the-crocodylians/][LINKED_TEXT: [6] ] [URL: #cite-CZHRa][LINKED_TEXT: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228017630_Dinosaur_Physiology_Were_Dinosaurs_Warm-Blooded] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228017630_Dinosaur_Physiology_Were_Dinosaurs_Warm-Blooded][LINKED_TEXT: [7] ] [URL: #cite-wVNgz][LINKED_TEXT: Tail-propelled aquatic locomotion in a theropod dinosaur - Nature] [URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2190-3]"},{"instruction":"A 500 ft. train travelling 500 ft per minute must travel through a 500 ft long tunnel.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"GLADLY. I am so sick of people trying to push laws on things they don’t know about. Magazine: A spring-fed container that holds rounds and pushes them up into a firearm to be chambered and fired. Clip: A rack holding rounds for storage or loading. Assault Gun: A self-propelled infantry support gun (a tank “cannon”) used as an anti-emplacement weapon Assault Weapon: A made-up term by anti-gun politicians to describe semi-automatic rifles with cosmetic features that make them resemble military weapons. Assault Rifle: A short rifle chambered in light-caliber ammunition capable of switching between semi- and fully automatic (I e., machine gun) fire control modes chambered in an “intermediate” cartridge that offers a balance between weight and impact. AR: An acronym for Armalite Rifle, a firearms company. For example, the AR15 is a semi-automatic rifle designed by Armalite, thus the AR acronym in the name. Often mistakenly claimed to stand for “assault rifle” AR15: A semi-automatic rifle chambered in the same caliber as the M16/M4 rifle. Contrary to popular belief, the AR15 is not an assault rifle as it does not possess select-fire capability. It also is not more “powerful” than other firearms, as it uses a caliber smaller than most hunting rounds. AR-pattern firearms are far and away the most popular and widely-owned sporting rifles in US history. Sniper: Again, contrary to popular belief, a “sniper” is not a firearm. There is no “high powered sniper rifle” that “needs to be banned”. A sniper is a military agent specialized in stealth and infiltration. Common sniper missions involve taking out officers, spying on enemies, and scouting the area. Bullet: The part of the cartridge that is propelled out the barrel of a gun. Round/cartridge: A complete piece of firearms ammunition, composed of the casing, propellant, primer, and bullet. Rifle: A long firearm with a spiral-grooved barrel designed to be fired with two hands. Gun: A slang term for firearms. The literal meaning of a “gun” is an artillery piece. Pistol: A short-barreled firearm without a stock. Semi-automatic: A fire control mode that fires one round and chambers the next with one trigger pull. Fully-automatic/machine gun: A fire control mode that fires multiple rounds per trigger pull. The import of fully automatic weapons in the US has been banned since 1986. It is still technically possible to buy an automatic but you must first find one as they are very rare due to the import ban, then you must pay a tax stamp as well as the price for the actual rifle which commonly reach five figures. I hope this makes sense. Remember, assault weapons are not a thing and the AR15 is not a “military assault rifle”. Please stop falling victim to politicians that manipulate mass shootings as political weapons."},{"instruction":"it true that the vast majority of Americans truly believe that the USA singlehandedly won the Second World War, and that the British Empire and USSR contributed either nothing or just very little to the Allied victory?","output":"Hardly. I'm not sure the Allies would have won without us, but I'm also pretty sure we could have ended the conflicts earlier if we'd read the writing on the wall and gotten off the darned fence in both world wars! There's no question that our production of war materiel was essential to winning especially World War II, but the fighting and dying was very much a group effort. I do think sometimes some of the Allies (mostly private individuals, not government officials) belittle our contributions though and it makes us feel a bit underappreciated though."},{"instruction":"What is the practical value of the bottom number in a time signature?

Most rock songs are like this.3/4 means that there are 3 beats to each bar, and that a 1/4 note (the black golf club with no flag) is one beat. This is a waltz.2/4 means that there are 2 beats to each bar, and that a 1/4 note (the black golf club with no flag) is one beat. You might hear some old songs like this.6/8 means that there are 6 beats to each bar, and that a 1/8 note (the black golf club with one flag) is one beat. The feel for this is actually like two beats per bar, where each beat feels like a triple. The Washington Post march is a tune like that.12/8 means that there are 12 beats to each bar, and that a 1/8 note (the black golf club with one flag) is one beat. The feel is four beats per bar, with each felt beat being a triplet or a shuffle. Sweet Home Chicago is an example. The top and bottom numerals work together to create a meaning for the player. They see 12/8, and immediately know the tune is probably a blues shuffle. It might seem confusing that an eighth note is called a “beat” in 12/8, while we actually feel four beats per bar, not 12. Would it make more sense to write the time sig as 4/4 to nail the tempo, and write the twelve eighth notes as triplets? No, because triplets take a bit longer to read, with the little 3 and the tied bar over the triplet: imagine a whole chart filled with triplets. So writing 12/8 is cleaner over the whole chart."},{"instruction":"ve you ever hired someone because of their Udacity Nanodegree?","output":"Really, NO ONE has every completed this program and gotten a job.

Here are some tips to help you produce high-quality vector graphics: Choose the right software: Start with a vector editing software like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Inkscape, or Affinity Designer. These tools offer powerful features specifically designed for vector drawing.Understand the purpose: Know the purpose of your vector drawing. Whether it's a logo, illustration, infographic, or any other design, understanding the context will guide your creative decisions.Plan your design: Sketch your idea on paper or create a digital wireframe before diving into the final vector creation. This planning phase will help you organize your thoughts and avoid making unnecessary changes later.Use simple shapes: Vector drawings are composed of basic shapes like circles, squares, rectangles, and lines. Start with simple shapes and gradually build more complex elements from them.Pay attention to proportions: Ensure that the proportions of your vector drawing are accurate and visually appealing. Use grids or guidelines if necessary.Be mindful of color: Choose a color palette that complements the purpose and mood of your design. Too many colors can be distracting, so aim for a harmonious color scheme.Master bezier curves: Bezier curves are essential in vector graphics. Learn how to manipulate anchor points and handles to achieve smooth and precise curves.Align and distribute elements: Use alignment tools to ensure your elements are properly aligned and evenly spaced. Consistency is crucial for a professional-looking design.Work in layers: Organize your vector drawing by using layers. This allows you to control individual elements easily and make adjustments without affecting the entire design.Save backups: Regularly save backups of your work in different stages of the design process. This way, you can always revert to a previous version if needed.Pay attention to typography: If your vector drawing involves text, choose appropriate fonts and pay attention to kerning, tracking, and leading. Make sure the text is legible and visually pleasing.Use gradients and effects judiciously: Gradients and effects can enhance your design, but avoid overusing them, as they can make the artwork appear cluttered.Export in the right format: When saving or exporting your vector drawing, choose a suitable file format such as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for web use or EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) for print projects.Seek inspiration: Look at other vector drawings or artworks to get inspired and learn new techniques. Don't copy designs, but use them as a reference to spark your creativity. Remember that creating impressive vector drawings takes practice and patience. Keep experimenting, learning, and refining your skills to produce exceptional results over time."},{"instruction":"Where can I find packers and movers in Noida?","output":"got to know about this from my cousins and they suggested me White gloves packers and movers.

Each of them is talented in a different area and have different traits and personalities that presents different challenges. Our daughters have a wider range of interests while our son has fewer interests. I’ll start with my eldest ( 21 year old daughter ) who completed her Law Degree in Cambridge University in 2019: Started reading at 2 plus.She took a long time to sleep. Sometime, we would put her in the back seat of our car and we would drive around the block until she fell asleep.She could remember all the CD track numbers of songs we played in the car at age 3 plus - we had not realised that she was paying attention to the CD track numbers until she blurted out the numbers of the songs she wanted us to playShe created over a hundred names for imaginary friends so she could entertain herself at age 4. She would talk about her many imaginary friends almost non-stop so that go us a little worried.At age 5 she could recite 20-page story bookss word for word after reading 2 or 3 times.At age 5 she could recite at least 2 pages of a story book backwards, word for word: eg. It was a bright and sunny day. Peter and Jane decided to go to the park. She could recite it in reverse order: Park the to go to decided Jane and Peter. Day sunny and bright a was it. ( One day, she made it clear that she did not enjoy this exercise at all , so I stopped asking her to do it.)I could make her cry while I was singing just by changing my tone of voice to one that sounds sad. (I stopped when my wife complained that I was treating my daughter like a lab-rat).She studied in Vancouver Canada where she was tested at age 10 and placed in the gifted program. Her memory which was either in the 98th or 99th percentile stood out.Tops her class without having to study very hard. Things changed when she studied at Cambridge though.In 2009 , at the age of 12, she competed with 13,642 of Canada’s top Math students and became Champion at Fibonacci level. Next is my 18-year old son who will be completing High School this year: He learned to read at 2 years of age.He took a long time to go to sleep.He had problem with looking at people in the eye.At the age of 6 he had an intense interest in Science in general but especially Astronomy. Picked up a science guide book meant for 12 year-olds and read it intently - Surprisingly he understood most of the material.At 7, he was placed in advance Math.Very lazy and hates routine and boring tasks. He gets plenty of flak from us because of this. He was passionate in Math and Science but was very disinterested in other subjects and therefore had the tendency to drop the ball - lots of sleepless nights for his parents.Spends quite a bit of time daydeaming or playing computer games. My wife wanted to ban him from computer games but I disagreed.At 11 years old , he taught himself Java programming language and he immediately used it to write an interactive programme for his history project presentation while his friends used flip-charts and Power Point. He got an earful from me for bothering to write a computer programmed instead of using Power Point like normal people would.Often gets very engrossed in programming such that he forgets about his mealtimes.At 12 years old, he joined the school robotics team as a programmer. He also joined the Quiz team. He continued to teach himself other programming languages like C++ etc.He competed in many internatinal robotics competitions and even managed to reach the finals held at NASA in Texas.At 18, he successfully programmed an online Quiz question generator so that his schoolmates can practise for their inter-school competitions. This was a big challenge for him as it required very complex algorithms. As for my 8-year old daughter, all I would like to say is that she seems to have a combination of the best traits of both her older siblings . She loves her older sibling but she is very competitive and sometimes she feels down when she hears of their accomplishments. Unlike her older siblings, she is very excited to go to school every day(My latest update is that she is now 9 years old and has already programmed several computer games with Scratch having learnt how to programme using Scratch just 3 months ago. She’s a self-learner so she looks up youtube tutorials to learn the more advanced features of the programme).

If you have the equation a+b=c this would be the case when you know a and b and want to find c.Subtracting two numbers takes most people a tiny bit longer than adding them up. And in long subtraction the carry over is a tiny bit more complicated than with addition. If you have the equation a+b=c this would be the case when you know a and c and want to find b.Even more complicated is when you know a number c and have to find pairs of numbers that sum up to c. So you are looking for all pairs of a,b so that a+b=c. If you move from addition to multiplication the difference between these three types of operation. Multiplying numbers is easy.Dividing numbers is a bit harder than multiplying them.Finding all the factors of a number is really hard. Moving on to exponentiation there is a fourth category Calculating a to the power b is pretty easy, it's just repeated multiplying.Calculating the nth root of a number is a lot harder than the nth power.Calculating the base n logarithm of a number is even harder.Finding pairs of numbers n and b so that the nth root of c equals b ist even harder and the same goes for finding pairs of numbers so that the logarithm to base n of c equals b. This is why encrypting something with a key is a lot easier than decrypting something when you don't have the key (if you don't know the key it's like all those examples above where you have to find possible pairs of numbers, which is always the most difficult). In the cases where encrypting is easier than decrypting even if you know the key it's either for the same reason (different operations being necessary for encryption and decryption) or different keys being used and one of the keys contains smaller numbers (let's say for encryption you have to calculate n to the power of 13 and for decryption you would have to calculate n to the power of 12474834 because it's an asymmetric encryption with different keys for encryption and decryption)."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car brand in the world?","output":"Ford Model T - Introduced in 1908, it revolutionized the automobile industry by making cars affordable for the average person.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"It happened to me. I’m staying anonymous for obvious reasons. A few years back, part of my job required me to travel abroad. I spent 2-3 months home and abroad alternatively for about 2 years. I had a 2-year-old son and a side business which a few friends and I cofounded. I was busy with my day job so my wife helped run the store on my behalf so she spent a lot of time working at the store along with my friends One day, I was abroad and got a phone call from my wife saying she was pregnant again. It was totally unexpected, but soon the happy feeling overcame the vague doubt that I had. Fast forward a few years, I no longer had to travel for work and had 2 little boys that I love dearly. Everybody says my older son is a smaller version of me while the young one doesn't look anything like me, not in the slightest. I never had any suspicion about our biological relationship until one day I found out a conversation between my wife and one of my friend (who was married and had a child. Let's call him Ken) when I was away in which he confessed his affection for her. My wife denied any relationship between them and said that it was only Ken and that she did not reciprocate. I was shocked and could not believe Ken could do that to me, but it was just the beginning. Since then I had had this uneasy feeling. Somehow I knew my wife wasn't telling the truth, but I have no way to find out. As my younger boy growing up, he takes after Ken. I told myself I needed to settle this once and for all. I took DNA tests, twice. And as you can guess the two results confirmed that I was not the biological father. I was lost. Not in my wildest dream can I imagine this would happen to me. I asked my wife to tell me the truth, and with the evidence at hand, she couldn't deny it anymore and admitted to having an affair with my friend when I was gone. My world collapsed. I walked away broken. I wandered for a month here and there thinking about what I did wrong and for what purpose I was living. After I regain my sanity. I called my friend in the calmest way I can to inform him he had a son that he didn't know of and told him I was ready to give him back. Then I called my wife and said I wanted a divorce and everything had been arranged for that to happen the earliest possible. I want revenge. \\"They have to pay for what they did to me.\\" I thought. I fully provided for my wife financially, she had no job and wouldn't be able to support the child alone. Ken, on the other hand, was a successful businessman but he had a family with two daughters and I was sure he wouldn't have the courage to tell his wife about this, and I was right. For almost a year when we were in the middle of the divorce, he never once visited his son nor provided any support for him. I guess he was busy covering things up. I could have easily talked to his wife (we’re also friends) but I refrained. I did not want his innocent kids to be in the same situation as mine, at least not because of me. So we agreed that my older son would stay with me and the younger one would live with his mother after the divorce. My older son is kind of smart. He can take care of himself. He learned the alphabet, colors, and shapes by himself by watching youtube videos when I was gone for business (English is not our mother tongue and we’re living in an English speaking country). The second one is not as smart. He's soft and sentimental. So in a way I was really worried about him. I thought I would feel better after I had my revenge. I did not. When my selfishness died down, I really missed my younger son and the time we were together. I missed the time when he kissed me goodbye before I left for work on the sidewalk every morning and immediately ran to the front window, placed a chair so he could look outside and waved at me as I drove off. If you have children you probably know how that feels. As the divorce was closing (it was complicated because of the nature of our marriage), I dropped by one day to see him. His mother had to find a job, so she did not have the time to take good care of him as when they were living with me. He immediately dashed and hugged me as soon as I showed up at the doorstep. I got a look at him for a long time. He was having a skin disease due to the hygiene of the water where he was living and obviously was not in good shape. That hit me hard to look back and think how cute and healthy he used to be. When he asked \\"Dad, when will you pick me up and return home?\\", I was in tear before I knew it. I spent the night with him that day. In his dream, he was crying: \\"I want my dad. Where's my dad?\\". Suddenly all the memories came back, that moment when I first hold him in my arms on his birthday, all the white nights feeding him and changing explosive diapers while humming songs that do not exist trying to get him to sleep, that moment when he made his first step, all the family outing days when we ran, laughed, kissed and sang… All of those made I realize what was important to me and how bad I was as a father. I had failed my sons miserably. I just need my children to be happy. It didn't matter if he was my biological child or not. Our bond was real and strong. I love him, and he loves me. That's all that matters. I grew up with the blessing and love of my parents. Why did I let my son suffer because of the mistake he didn't make? I cried out loud like a child, it feels good to show your true feelings once in a while… Fast forward a year, we're now together again. I talked to Ken. We agreed the boy is MY son and he had to stay away from him for the rest of his life. The boys are growing fast, happy, and loved. I'm glad I got them in my life. This fatherhood is something I wouldn't trade the world for. I love my sons and still learning to be a good father... Update Thank you all for reading the story of my life and for commenting. I would like to clarify a few things: When I say my younger son was soft and sentimental, I did not mean in a negative way. Imagine you were a parent bear in the wild and you had two cubs. One was strong and smart, the other was not as so. Knowing surviving out there is hard and brutal, you’d probably worry about the latter more and probably would spend more time getting him prepared.As for Ken, I didn’t want to expose him because I couldn’t care less about him. What he was gonna do have nothing to do with me. He also has kids and I don’t want them to be without their parents because of his infidelity. Kids are innocent, I won’t repeat my mistake. Update 2 (and final) Wow, the response to my story was overwhelming so I decided to give some updates:I guess this story is incomplete without talking about my wife. Because of the immigration status, a divorce means separation for all of us so we’re putting that off. My wife and I are staying in the same roof like roommates. I’m helping her get all the trainings necessary for a better job when the situation changes. We’re staying friends and I sincerely hope things turn out better for her. After all, she’s still the mother of my kids and no one is happy to see their mom struggle.For those who called me weak, sucker… I thank you for thinking for me and I appreciate it. I totally understand your rationales. Had this not happened to me, I would have never thought I could do this. But when it’s a reality, you have to deal and learn from it. I’m glad I learned how to forgive and experienced love. You know that cliché saying ”When life gives you lemons, make lemonade”? Well, maybe it’s not very cliché after all."},{"instruction":"Why would anyone need a gun with more than 10 rounds for concealed carry?","output":"What is the specific purpose behind the limit of 10?

He’d talk about things that happened decades ago as if they happened last week, and couldn’t remember who any of his grandchildren were. It was incredibly disheartening, as he was as smart as a whip in his prime, and never forgot a face. But that’s beyond the point. While he was living at his assisted living facility, a member of our family would visit him everyday, and Johnny would tell them, every single time, that if they looked out the window of his room, we could see the boat taking off. For some reason, he thought he was on a cruise ship. Clearly, we weren’t. The window looked out into the fenced backyard of the facility, with a small garden and a dozen or so trees. But he was so genuinely excited about the boat taking off that he’d make us stand there and watch every single day. No one dared tell him otherwise. Why would we? Johnny had always loved the ocean, and the thought of being on a cruise ship delighted him. Even better, he never remembered the day before, so he got to experience the first day of the cruise everyday. So to answer your question, no, I don’t think it’s unethical to tell someone that they’re on a vacation. The “You’re having memory problems, so you have to stay here” speech tends to annoy them, and people with dementia can become violent if they’re agitated. I’d rather have my loved one be content with a lie than angry with the truth, especially if they’d have to re-learn the truth everyday."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car brand in the world?","output":"Oldsmobile F-88 Throughout the ’50s, General Motors hosted auto shows that displayed fancy prototypes and concept cars. But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally.

In 2008, two people died and many others got severely injured when a concrete pillar collapsed at Laxminagar metro project in Delhi. The local hospital administered basic first aid to the injured, but nothing else and sent them home to suffer quietly, as they were unable to afford the cost of treatment. That incident shook Omkar Nath Sharma who was present there and he became determined to not let something like this happen again. At that moment, he decided to collect left out medicines from middle class households and to redistribute them among needy people free-of-cost. He is doing this for last 8 years now. What makes it incredible is that: He lives in a rented room with his wife and his 45-year-old ‘mentally challenged’ son. Still, rather than focusing on earning money for his family, he has devoted his remaining life for the poor of Delhi.Since he cannot afford Delhi metro, he commuted across Delhi in buses using his senior citizen pass and walked to the remote areas where buses don't take him.A speeding car accident has left him partially paralyzed at the age of 12. Since then, it’s quite painful and difficult for him to walk. Still, at an age of 80, he walked 5–6 KM daily until recently, to collect these medicines. \\"I collect around one to five lakhs worth medicines in one month,\\" he says. These medicines are distributed free-of-cost to the needy under the supervision of doctors. NGOs distribute these medicines. He also sends some medicines to the hospitals, so that these may get used for the treatment of poor patients. The list of the recipient hospitals includes AIIMS, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Sucheta Kriplani Hospital, Deendayal Upadhyay Hospital etc. \\"Blood bank, organ bank and all other types of banks are available in our country today.

I worked in the family business, a busy motel South of Savannah, GA in the ’50s and ’60s before the Interstate pretty much shut down that stretch of beautiful motels. Before I went to work for my allowance, I was often in the care of a gentle Nanny who was the daughter of a freed slave who was an actual beneficiary of the ’20 acres and a mule’ policy and made a good life there. I spent a lot of time playing with her kids and grand-kids there. Her husband worked in the woods and drove a logging truck and there was still a wood cook-stove in the kitchen, a wood stove in the living room, and laundry was done in a big kettle over a wood fire. There was a bucket of those little, used-once, bars of soap next to the kettle. The room cleaners collected the soap and took it home, along with the bottles left behind to collect the deposits, considered the soap and the bottles ‘tips’ and were never short of soap. Our father paid the best, and we all called the employees Mr, Miss, or Mizz. This was during the times when I’d ride in the front of the bus if Nanny took me downtown and she’d ride in the back. Woolworth’s had a ‘colored’ lunch counter upstairs and I’d eat at the ‘white’ one downstairs. I once rented a room to the couple of black folk who were driving their employers to Florida, didn’t think anything of it, until the Sheriff showed up, ran them out of their room, and wanted to arrest me for renting it to them. I found them accommodation at the only motel for them, in Garden City, was disgusted by the treatment of these people.

Tooth whitening Whitening treatments have a huge impact on the way you look and can be done in house or at home, or a combination of both. Veneers These are wafer thin slivers of porcelain that are bonded to the front surface of teeth to improve the look of worn, broken, discoloured or gappy teeth. They are made at specialist laboratories to look indistinguishable from natural teeth. They aren’t always the best solution but in cases where they are, they achieve an excellent aesthetic result. Crowns Dental crowns can be made to replace broken down teeth. The materials are now so highly advanced that a completely natural look can be achieved in many cases, especially when used in conjunction with gum contouring. Composite Bonding This technique can be used to repair and/or enhance natural teeth. The materials are excellent so the result looks completely natural. This treatment has the advantage of being minimally invasive and is often a good alternative to veneers. Bridges These can be used to replace missing teeth either with or without dental implants. Dental Implants These are used to replace missing teeth and essentially become a new tooth. They can look completely natural, can function like normal teeth and if looked after, can last as long as natural teeth. They also have the benefit of preserving facial bone which would otherwise be lost without a ‘root’ of a tooth, and this in turn helps to keep the years off your face! Orthodontics We offer invisible orthodontics and 6 Month Smiles. Sometimes orthodontics is used to move teeth into a position to maximise the aesthetic result of veneers, crowns or bridges. Gum Contouring This is done to improve the health of your gums and the appearance of your smile. It can achieve a more uniform gum line. At Wayside, we use dental lasers for all gum contouring treatments, which achieves a better result than with a scalpel."},{"instruction":"When you apply for a permit for the construction of a residential swimming pool, do you have to register the method of construction you intend to use?","output":"Q: When you apply for a permit for the construction of a residential swimming pool, do you have to register the method of construction you intend to use?

At that time, we organized holidays (school, May Day, Victory Day (May 9)), as the authorities were afraid to tell the truth to people. I remember well that time, and the events that took place later - 1986 -1991 and beyond. Therefore, I don't think radiation is the worst thing on Earth. During this period of time, especially in the 1990s, our society behaved very strangely - it literally destroyed itself, moreover, all people considered what was happening to be a blessing. I have always been apolitical, but it was strange for me to see that people literally destroy their jobs (for example, some were literally taken apart), and at the same time they believe that they will live better in the future... But, the media, the authorities convinced that everything will be fine, and the most amazing thing is that people believed in it. No one opposed, everyone was only in favor. People, as if hypnotized, watched the speeches of the leader of the USSR (M. Gorbachev), whose speeches were essentially informational spam - only promises for a better life (paradise) and no specifics. His speeches were watched by the entire 300 millionth country. Literally. Similarly, almost all people watched the performances of various \\"magicians\\", \\"psychics\\", etc. - were treated in this way (watched on television and listened to on tape recorders). It's funny, but it was real. Also, the population began to massively read the \\"new\\" literature on magic, esotericism, astrology and the like. People went to courses in magic, astrology, etc., and there were short-term courses (several months), but some courses were designed for several years. On TV, they showed how a psychic at a distance of several thousand kilometers remotely relieves pain in a patient who is undergoing surgery. And, everyone believed in it. The country literally went crazy... I note that it was a country of scientists, engineers and doctors, so the question arises: how could it all be? I then watched with surprise what was happening, because I did not quite understand how the destruction of everything that was, can improve life. In short, I studied, and fundamentally did not want to participate in anything. Besides, I didn't understand how people could believe in \\"magic\\" for so long. \\"Magic\\" and some familiar \\"magicians\\" amused me, no more... Of course, there is a novelty effect, but they figured it out and forgot about magic, but no, hell lasted for a very long time. Now I sometimes think about those times, and I don’t find a good explanation. Since I do not believe that it is possible to inspire such self-destructive things to a country of 300 million by means of an information attack. Considering my knowledge of organic chemistry, I think it is more logical to explain what is happening as an attack with the help of substances that change the consciousness of people in a certain way (if they are used en masse, on the whole society, for example, in food and drinks). It is well known that even paracetamol has the side effect of inducing riskier behavior in people. Of course, the effect of paracetamol is insignificant, but it definitely is. If we set ourselves the goal of finding and synthesizing similar substances that will have strongly pronounced indicated effects (of a certain direction), then we can explain the insanity of an entire country by an attack using such substances. This project is quite feasible. Perhaps someone has already done this, and probably applied it (you must admit that if you are attacked, then you don’t have to know about it). These substances can be potent (then it is almost impossible to detect them), but they can be well-known substances with completely different declared functionality (food supplements, drink additives, etc.). In short, probably, everything was like the movie \\"Equilibrium\\". If this technology exists and is used to control people, then it is much worse than radiation. This is a completely different level of hell... Probably this is the most dangerous thing on Earth."},{"instruction":"Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time? Who's to blame?","output":"So the #1 pick that year, Hakeem Olajuwan, was so much better than Jordan in their early careers that the Rockets team immediately improved 19 games and flipped from losing to winning seasons in their rookie year. In Hakeem’s second year, he ALREADY led his team all the way to the NBA Finals (losing to the Celtics in 6 games in 1986). Meanwhile, Jordan’s Bulls continued to have losing seasons for his first three years, also going 1–9 in the playoffs those years (getting swept immediately twice by the Bullets and Celtics). The Bulls didn’t become serious contenders until they added several more pieces (Pippen and Grant in particular..and they also swapped their head coach to Phil Jackson). They didn’t make it to the NBA finals until Jordan’s SEVENTH season (winning the 1991 Finals vs an injury-laden Laker team in 5 games). Olajuwan’s Rockets also maintained a winning record vs Jordan’s Bulls throughout their entire respective careers. Jordan was reported (in 2016) to have openly admitted that Olajuwan was the one player he feared to face in his career. So the Houston Rockets clearly made the right choice with their pick. They just weren’t in a position to follow up after that with the other tools they needed for success (at least not for several years). And that was partly because Olajuwan added so much value so early that their subsequent draft position plummeted after they added Hakeem to the roster. In the 5 years after the 1984 draft, the Rockets average pick position was 20th compared to the Bulls who averaged picking 9th over those same 5 years (in the late 80s). You could make a strong argument that Jordan’s team successes in his later career were directly connected to his team failures in his earlier career. Whereas Olajuwan improved his team so fast that it actually hampered and slowed their ultimate success. It is most unfortunate that Jordan ran off to play baseball in 1993 and then returned in poor form in the spring of 1995…thus depriving the basketball world of the opportunity to find out definitively in the 1994 and 1995 Finals who really was the better superstar. The Rockets won the title both those years whereas the Bulls sandwiched them with three titles each on either side of that. The two teams never faced in the playoffs. The Rockets with Olajuwan were 12–9 vs the Jordan Bulls from 1984 thru 1998. In any event, I’m confident the Rockets have zero regrets about their 1984 pick (except possibly their jersey sales). The Portland Trailblazers—on the other hand—would (I’m sure) LOVE to have their #2 pick back. They famously took Sam Bowie Sam Bowie with their pick in 1984 . . .immediately ahead of Jordan to the Bulls at #3. They traded Bowie to New Jersey after four seasons."},{"instruction":"w do you know dinosaurs actually existed just other than fossils?","output":"Q: “How do you know dinosaurs actually existed just other than fossils?” The Little Black Rose - - - We would not really know otherwise.

When everything went digital - all that required perfection went out the window, in fact people realised that it’s the imperfection of Vinyl that makes it so attractive.

Burgess Meredith played Mickie, Rocky's trainer/Manager. In the original Rocky, the part of Mickie was written specifically for Lee J. Cobb. (For those of you too young to remember, Lee J. Cobb was a huge actor in his day; a true A-lister. Anyway, Sly Stallone wrote the part of Mickie for Cobb specifically because of how much he loved Cobb's work and would make the ideal character of the trainer that Sly wanted for Rocky. Sly told Cobb all this and asked him to come down and read the part, just so they could find the right people to work with Cobb. Cobb said that he had not read for a part in 30 years and would not do it. Sly practically begged him and explained that it was only so that they could get the right people to work around him, but he refused and told Sly that he should be able to determine that by his past work. Sly then asked Burgess to come down and read for it and Burgess was completely willing to come down and read, just as any professional would do. History was made, Burgess got the part, got known to a whole new generation of fans, it lead to doing more movies, and Cobb has been forgotten to everyone past his own generation. My point was simply that even the best of them must occasionally read. While it is true that many of the big names will occasionally get the part without reading for it, it is not a common, or a given. (Oh and Lee J. Cobb claimed that he had no regrets of losing that part.... Anyone who believes that, stand on their head.)"},{"instruction":"What is the smallest amount of a compound that still has the properties of that compound?","output":"I don’t think that anyone can give a precise answer to this question. If we try to predict the physical properties of one molecule, or even several molecules of a substance, we will find that we don’t have any valid equations or theories to do this. Many properties of substances depend on the complex relationships among the molecules themselves. One example from the realm of nuclear chemistry is that we can predict the time it takes for one half of a large sample of unstable nuclei within a molecule to decompose ( half-life). However, if we have only one ( or two or three, for example) atoms of the unstable nucleus, there is no equation which allows us to predict or calculate this ."},{"instruction":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","output":"The current education system in the US faces several challenges and criticisms that have sparked debates and calls for reform. Some of the major issues include: Inequality in Access: Access to quality education is unequal, with students from low-income communities often having fewer resources and opportunities compared to their affluent counterparts. This disparity perpetuates an achievement gap, limiting upward mobility for disadvantaged students. Funding Disparities: Public schools are funded primarily through local property taxes, leading to significant disparities in funding between wealthy and economically challenged areas. Insufficient funding can result in overcrowded classrooms, outdated materials, and limited extracurricular activities. Teacher Shortages and Retention: The education system faces challenges in recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers. Low salaries, lack of support, and demanding workloads contribute to teacher burnout and high turnover rates. College Affordability: The rising costs of higher education and student loan debt burden can deter students from pursuing college or lead to financial struggles after graduation. Lack of Parental Involvement: Limited parental involvement in their children's education can hinder student success and engagement."},{"instruction":"What is the story behind why Canadians selected the loon to be featured on Canadian dollar coins?","output":"It was an accident. The original dies for the one dollar coin, which featured two voyageurs in a canoe were lost in transit en route to the Mint's facility at Winnipeg. Since it was suspected they were stolen, the backup design which featured a common loon was used instead. This turned out to be a brilliant marketing move since Canadians, who have never taken their money very seriously, started calling it a “loonie” to show their disrespect for it and adopted it enthusiastically. Americans who take their money more seriously won’t take anything that is not paper and green. The loonie preceded the introduction of the “toonie”, the two-tone two dollar coin. People discovered that you could break the centre out of it, leading to the joke, “Can you break a toonie”. Yes, just freeze it and use a hammer — a popular pastime for a while. They are much more widely used than the old two dollar bill was. It followed the old theme of playing card money, which was used in New France after the ship carrying the payroll money failed to arrive one year. Since it is a bad idea not to pay the soldiers, who have all the guns, the Governor cut up playing cards, wrote amounts on them, and issued them to the troops as pay. It was very popular. The remaining bills are now made of plastic, are brightly coloured, and you can shine a light through a transparent window in them and see a hologram. They can go through the washing machine and come out clean, which leads to jokes about money laundering.

One of the companies that offer dropshipping services is Fulfillman Dropshipping Services. Fulfillman provides a range of services, including product sourcing, order processing, inventory management, and shipping. Their services can help entrepreneurs save time and money by handling the logistics of running a dropshipping business.

They passed her along to me, to be a companion to my cat since I was up to my neck in at University. My cat took Heidi under her wing, and insisted that they BOTH get my full attention. I got some weight on her when I realized she could hold down neither milk nor dried food. So, we were getting along fairly well. However. I was a full time student living in an old caretaker’s shack in an alley in Seattle. It was a nice neighborhood, with old apartment buildings and houses that were upscale in the 1920s and still desirable. Heidi started spending more and more time away from home, and a neighbor mentioned seeing her on the porch of one of the very nice old homes. Then one day she showed up, plump and gorgeous, with a lovely pink rhinestone collar. She spent a little time with me, and more with the other cat. Thanks for all the fish, etc. And we didn’t see her again. She was not an alley cat, thank you very much.

One day, she came home with a bruise on her cheek - just a small one, but it was a bruise. I asked what happened to her? She told me that a patient’s son hit her in the face because he thought she was ignoring his father - who was in pain while actually she was busy with another patient who was more critical. I asked her what happened next? She told me: “Oh, I came to that patient as soon as I finished with the one I was working on. Talked to him, comforted him and gave him some meds. Then I explained the situation to the son, and he apologized”. 7 year old me that day got angry and asked: “Why? You’re the best nurse, why didn’t you let someone else deal with that patient? His son hit you. He didn’t deserve your care!” And my mom’s answer that day became one of the most important lessons I carry with myself through life: “Sweetie, you should never let someone’s bad action to be the reason for your own. Fixing something wrong by doing something wrong will never work. That man hit me may have been wrong, but if I hadn’t taken care of his father, I wouldn’t have been right. Moreover, it was the son who made the mistake, why should the father has to face the consequences? Your mom is the best nurse, so I do the best, right?” So, if my neighbor never says hello to me first? That doesn’t stop me from saying hello and wishing them a good day.

There are so many amazing things to learn in this world, but here are a few that I found particularly surprising: 1. Russia is bigger than Pluto: When it comes to surface area, the country of Russia is in fact bigger than our former planet Pluto. Russia covers about 17 million square kilometers, while Pluto covers about 16.6 million square kilometers. That definitely puts this tiny space rock into perspective. 2. Carrots were originally purple: The orange carrots we know and love today are actually the result of selective breeding by Dutch farmers in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to create carrots that matched the color of their national flag, so they crossed yellow and red carrots to produce orange ones. The original carrots were purple, with some variations of white, yellow, red, and black. 3. There are more museums in the US than there are McDonald’s and Starbucks combined: According to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, there are about 35,000 museums in the US, ranging from art and history to science and zoos. In comparison, there are about 14,000 McDonald’s and 15,000 Starbucks locations in the US. That means you have more than twice as many options to learn something new than to grab a burger or a coffee. 4. Cleopatra lived closer to the invention of the iPhone than she did to the building of the Great Pyramid: Cleopatra was born in 69 BC and died in 30 BC, while the Great Pyramid of Giza was built around 2560 BC. That means she lived about 2,530 years after the pyramid was completed. On the other hand, the first iPhone was released in 2007 AD, which is about 2,037 years after Cleopatra’s death. That means she was closer in time to us than to her ancient ancestors. 5. There are more fake flamingos in the world than real flamingos: The plastic lawn flamingo was invented in 1957 by Don Featherstone and became a popular symbol of American suburbia. Since then, millions of fake flamingos have been produced and sold around the world. Meanwhile, the real flamingo population is estimated to be around 2 to 4 million, which is less than half of the fake ones.

They ain't the same thing. Of course, we make this kind of mistake, it's part of the learning process. Welcome to the human race. Your question is related to an important area of inquiry and practice in Buddhism i.e. the sublime-emotions. “The second of the four divine abodes—the highest emotions—is compassion, whose far enemy is cruelty and whose near enemy is pity. Pity can’t give others any help. If someone pours out her heart to us and we pity her, then two people are suffering instead of one. If by contrast we give her our compassion, we help her through her trouble. It’s very important to develop compassion for oneself, because it’s the precondition for being able to do so for others. If someone doesn’t meet us lovingly, it will be easier for us to give this person compassion instead of love. It’s easier because now we know that this person who comes to meet us unlovingly is angry or enraged, is most definitely unhappy. If she were happy, she wouldn’t be angry or enraged. Knowing about the other’s unhappiness makes it easier for us to summon up compassion, especially when we’ve already done so with respect to our own unhappiness. Unfortunately we often deal with our own suffering in the wrong way. Instead of acknowledging it and meeting ourselves with compassion, we try to escape our trouble as quickly as possible by developing self-pity or getting distracted or making someone else responsible for it. Here compassion is the only possibility for meeting our difficulties. We experience exactly what the Buddha teaches: in this world suffering exists. That’s the first Noble Truth. Then we can try to acknowledge what we really want to have or get rid of, and thus make suffering our teacher. There is no better one, and the more we listen to it and find a way into what it’s trying to make us understand, the easier the spiritual path will prove. This path aims to change us so emphatically that in the end we may not even recognize ourselves.” Source: [LINKED_TEXT: The Four Highest Emotions – Lions RoarWhen we think of love, we have ideas that are purely personal.

Frederich would undoubtedly carve a more liberal path for his country, rejecting the Prussian militarism and nationism of Bismarck. It seems inconceivable that European history would have progressed as it did in our timeline if Frederich had been dictating policy rather than his son. For one thing, he would not have build a vast naval fleet, naturally alienating Britain. Moreover, he will likely have sought to maintain Germany’s natural alliance with Russia and seek closer ties and reconciliation with France.

They work there for a few years, save enough to open their own shops. That’s why you see them multiply like rabbits across the US. California and Texas are too competitive for business, so they move to states that have virtually no competition. They tend to go into communities with virtually no Asians to avoid competition as the natives love their meticulous works. In such states, one can make as much as 5K/month. There are ads in VN newspapers recruiting newcomers to faraway states with guaranteed salaries of 3K/month with room and board paid. Being thrifty as most of them are, they save about 80% of that.

Are there any disadvantages?","output":"I have an IQ over 150…yes I’ve been tested and its been confirmed, but who the hell cares anyway. IQ is not an indicator of success…its an indicator of “group” success (in other words, statistically speaking, people who score higher as a group do better than OTHER groups of people with lower scores). Further, its not an indicator of “intelligence” and that issue has been very hotly debated, but rather a list of skills that usually translate to assimilating information faster. In my youth, I had a near photographic memory so I needed to read textbooks in college only once in order to retain the information for the full year and then regurgitate the information back out on paper at test time. Thus, my higher IQ was helpful in school and in academic situations, but beyond that, my IQ has not been “life changing.” I will say that I learn things faster, I figure out processes quicker, and I can deconstruct and then reconstruct almost anything, but, again, unless I’m in construction or a trade, that’s not that useful. Now I’m speaking only as me—so don’t everyone go hating—but I do find that a lot of my compadres with higher IQs also suffer from mental health issues due, in part, to the higher IQ and the higher sensitivity to the world around them. My own problems border on agoraphobia, eating disorders in my past, and stress related problems because people with higher IQs also have greater expectations for themselves and are often put in pressure situations where expectations are high BECAUSE you’re smarter, so it’s a pretty bad spiral. Now at 60, I’ve learned “balance” and I don’t care about my IQs or that of others. I think being able to learn things faster has always been a benefit, but I think the pressures of being smarter is a downside."},{"instruction":"What are the best restaurants to try when visiting Bengaluru, Karnataka, India?

Actual hurricanes, no: hurricanes are tropical cyclones, and the British Isles are too far north to be hit by any of those. The storms that hit the British Isles are extratropical cyclones: the more specific name for a severe storm in this area is a European windstorm, although this is rarely used in everyday language. On the other side of the Atlantic, the equivalent kind of storm to a European windstorm is a nor’easter, and in fact many European windstorms start off as nor’easters."},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"Yes long ago when I rented a business place from my landlord.

However keeping in view my good paying record and the way I kept the premises nicely and even invested in it’s decoration, the landlord offered me to lower the rent.

Expect the other drivers to be rash and so think of evading measures if they come too close. Never lose your temperament, even if your car gets damaged. These are measures which may help you but no surety can be assured. For assuring an accident free road the following is required. Total revamping of traffic rules, signs and markings, with explanation. The latter two will require specifications for visibility. Also specifications for vehicles, mainly it's headlights and roads, regarding it's roughness to speed, etc. Specification regarding highways are given by MoRTH and IRC. These are found ineffective, especially when patchwork is done. At present, most of our rules, signs and markings are based on low density and low speed traffic. Participation of locals along with the police for checking. This enables the police to take action against politicians and influential people, which they are now loth to do, fearing repercations. Also, they are independent witnesses, not influenced by the governments need to make finance. Making a separate unit for traffic control, either under the police or separately. Law being a vast subject and the frequent transfers to different branches cause the officials to be dunces regarding rules.

Why? In 2003, Apple had only 3.2% of U.S. computer market share. While they made great products, they didn’t have the scale for much else to matter. The decision was also a big deal, as Apple was legendary for only making software for their own hardware: making anything for Windows was reportedly an unspeakable act. This decision helped iPods (and the insanely convenient experience they created for listening to digital music at the time) reach the masses. They quickly penetrated the computing market as a highly desirable accessory, and gave Apple a seat at the table to market and upsell Windows users: a strategic coup no less. This matters because those iPods created a halo effect for buying other Apple products. Their success helped act as an off-ramp for Windows users who would buy Macs. For example, a few years later, on the back of millions of iPods sold, Apple more than doubled their annual Mac sales. Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Apple reports 546 million profit] [URL: https://www.macworld.com/article/1053454/appleprofit.html] This lay the foundation for further market penetration of Macs and eventually iPhones. While the iPhone was a step-function improvement on phones, the scale earned from the iPod certainly gave Apple strategic assets that would go on to help them realize success in the phone market today. The lesson here is simple but hard to execute: in markets with network effects, scale matters if you want to be relevant. To that end, creating a great, complementary product that piggybacks an existing ecosystem is a strategic pattern for gaining scale when you have none."},{"instruction":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","output":"Not at all.

Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","output":"If Dr. Ambedkar as a child was Made to sit on a gunny bag in the classroomBeaten for drinking water in common tapShown filthy water to satisfy thirstTold that his hair defiled a shaving razorNot allowed to learn Sanskrit then such a child, who was a co-religionist like the other caste Hindus, could not have developed love towards such a religion that did not condemn these things. Can the need to develop love for such a religion arise, if after becoming a doctor, professor, lawyer, member of Bombay legislative council, a person still had to face the following because of religion and caste, as did Dr. Ambedkar? Refusal of room to stay in BarodaEngagement in legal battles for years, just to ensure the untouchables are granted the right to drink water from public wells and lakes.Denial of entry to temples Could Dr. Ambedkar have loved Hinduism after witnessing the following: Caste Hindus violating human rights to the extreme, strictly practising prohibited vocations mentioned in the Vedas, simultaneously being proud of their Dharmashastras which suggest molten lead should be poured into the ears of Shudras if they hear the recitation of the Vedas, their tongue cut off if they recite Vedic verses and eyes gouched for attempting to read them.Untouchables deprived of literacy and education by the caste Hindus.Proposal to divide untouchables equally among the Hindus and MuslimsDoctor's refusal to attend the needs of a pregnant untouchable lady, resulting in her deathUntouchables beaten by the Caste Hindus for serving and eating gheeUntouchables eating carrions, thrown out crumbs, removed carcass and treated as sub-humansTheir shadows, voice and touch being considered polluting and so not being given any employment in any field. Their dharma (forced on them) was to do the most unclean chores which no other caste Hindu would even think of doing.Caste Hindus not showing an iota of sympathy towards the untouchables. Not only Dr. Ambedkar, why would any outcastes not hate the “religion” that had customs, because of which they had to endure such treatment? Not allowed temple entry despite having the same “gods” as the caste Hindus.Not allowed to be priests since the duties of priesthood were reserved only for Brahmins who, even though could be defiled and corrupted were considered greater than the gods.Forced into unpleasant jobs like manual scavenging recognised to be the duty of untouchables onlySegregated and made to live in insanitary, dark cottages/locations. (Even in this century the last two points are shamelessly inflicted on them) To conclude, Dr Ambedkar regarded Hindu society as nothing but a composition of thousands of castes, contributing to a system of graded degradation that is now commonly referred to as the caste system.

Here are a few reasons why the researcher is seen as the instrument in qualitative research: 1. Subjectivity and Interpretation: In qualitative research, the focus is on understanding and interpreting subjective experiences, meanings, and social phenomena. The researcher's personal characteristics, experiences, and perspectives inevitably influence the data collection and analysis process. Researchers bring their own subjectivity and interpretive lens to the study, shaping how they observe, ask questions, and make sense of the data. 2. Data Collection: Qualitative research often involves methods such as interviews, observations, and focus groups, where the researcher interacts directly with participants. The way the researcher asks questions, probes for further information, and engages with participants can impact the depth and quality of the data collected. The researcher's interpersonal skills, cultural sensitivity, and ability to establish rapport play a significant role in gathering rich and insightful data. 3. Reflexivity and Positionality: Researchers in qualitative studies are encouraged to reflect on their own biases, assumptions, and preconceptions that might influence the research process and findings. Acknowledging their positionality and actively considering how their background and beliefs shape their understanding of the research topic is essential. This reflexivity allows researchers to be aware of their potential impact on the research and to address any biases that may arise. 4. Data Analysis: Analyzing qualitative data involves the researcher engaging in the process of coding, categorizing, and identifying themes or patterns. The interpretation and meaning-making of the data are highly dependent on the researcher's insights, theoretical perspectives, and analytical skills. The researcher's ability to recognize nuances, make connections, and draw meaningful conclusions from the data is integral to the research outcomes. It is important for researchers to be transparent about their role as the instrument and to provide a clear account of their own background, biases, and reflections in the research process. This enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the research findings and allows for critical evaluation of the researcher's influence on the study."},{"instruction":"What would happen if there was only one isotope of each element?

The reaction of people varies from time to time. But there are some intriguing facts that mo one can change. You keep asking why and how. 1 . ECONOMISING FOR FUTURE. Humans have a tendency to gather money until they are old. They keep working hard and sacrifying their life just to know that the day they will die ,everything will be left behind. And still they keep running after money. They economise for future but for whom? When it will be time to enjoy the money ,you are on the wake of leaving this world. 2 . AT A CONCERT. Humans shout, cry ,laugh, smile at the first sight of the celebrities, for eg pop singers, kpop singers, or others but you will find some who will shed tears ,a lot of tears, they cry, as if they have lost a dear one It may be tears of joy,but they continue to cry incessantly. 3 . AT THE TICKETS SALE People queue up from early morning till the evening to buy tickets of a show or concert. If not being able to get the tickets, then you opt to buy in black market or persuade others to sell their tickets to you for twice,thrice the original price but you must see the show. No matter what. In case you don't get the tickets then you become sad,knowing that tomorrow there will be another show at the same time and you can buy your tickets today itself. 4 .THE ROTTEN POLICY TO SAY IT'S NOT ME ,IT'S HIM. Humans have a tendency of putting the blame on others. You commit a mistake, buy you won't accept it. You won't agree that you are at fault , that you are guilty. You throw it on others, “ it's not me,it's him.” Yhis is the unique and rotten policy that humans have adopted and that is prevailing for years and years. No human has been able to change it. 5 .LOVE AFFAIRS You are in love with someone, the other person is genuinely attached to you. What you do, you tell your partner that you just wanted a casual relationship. Nothing more. You don't care of the feelings of your partner. You dump your partner to start with another and then another. This process if fake live and relationship is just a formality to you. 6 .CURIOSITY Humans are curious. It of curiosity ,they commit the irreparable. Your spouse is having an affair, that is what you have been told. You get anxious, you want to know if it's true or not. Instead of trusting your partner to break apart . You put your relationship at stake and bring it to a point of no return. 7 . OBSESSION. Humans are obsessed with certain things in life. Some are obsessed with their relationship, wife ,girlfriend, boyfriend etc.and otherswith money. They are never satisfied . We have people abandoning the normal life and adopting: lesbianism or homosexuality and so on. 8 . GENIUS MIND We all know that human brain only functions about 15% . Albert Einstein was amongst the genius personality that the planet has produced. His formula is being used in different departments of the world. From space craft to navigation and so on. Due to that formula several discoveries have been made. But humans are still behaving negatively. They turned from positive to negative. Instead of creating new things for the benefit of the world, if humanity, they have created wars ,destruction. 9 . SEX AND PORN MOVIES Many human beings are affected by sex and porn movies. You are married, have a beautiful wife or girlfriend or boyfriend, who is by your side and what you do ,you insert a CD or DVD or a pen drive in your home cinema system and start watching porn movies. You request your partner to give you company when you could have enjoyed the moment with your partner itself. 10. JEALOUSY People are not satisfied with what they have. They want to imitate their neighbours. If they are not able to get what their neighbours have ,they start backbiting. “ Oh, you know,my neighbour has bought a BMW car. I think he is involved in drugs or money laundering.” This is the way human behave in our society.

We just met here and we are not from same reality either” Dara said, “Ares was researching to beat you for a long time, suddenly he found an old book from Olympia which helped open this portal therefore you two meet with each other for the first time, after that he met with Loki and both of them put their brains together and defeated both of you by uniting both of your enemies through a very big war but it lasted for a long long time, you guys got close to each other during the battle and Wonder Woman gave birth to me, but it was a distraction from Enchantress as she put a love spell on both of you so that you guys made love to each other and get distracted from the war which made sure the obvious loss so in a way I am a reminder of that loss, after you two died, lady Sif and Wonder Man married to each other and brought me up as their own and taught me everything, but it was already a dark world ruled by Loki and Ares, I was the rebel leader, I finally found my father hammer and my mother's flashing blade, I am fighting them since, but it was still not enough as I am the only one, both lady Sif and Wonder Man died in the battle” Both Diana and Thor was speechless Thor looked at Wonder Woman and said to Dara, “Don't worry, we are with you on this war, we will help you defeat them” Diana said, “Exactly” Both of them went to Dara's home and saw big portrait of them Diana said to Thor, “It kinds of feel weird, isn't it?” Thor said, “I don't know, I think it suits us” Suddenly, a huge explosion happened outside Dara said, “They are attacking us, they found this place, we have no choice but to fight” Thor said, “Then let's give them what they want” Wonder woman said, “Then let us attack them first” in saying this she flew away Thor said, “Really magnificent this lady” Both of them attacked that huge army with their full might Dara joined them. Loki said to Ares, “I thought we defeated them, why are they here?” Ares said, “Someone played a trick on us” Suddenly, An individual appeared out of nowhere and said, “I thought I needed to even the playing field since you two have unfair advantage” Ares said, “You pathetic Phantom Stranger, you coward, you don't have it in you to fight but you dare to do this, you will have your punishment” Phantom Stranger disappeared with a huge laughter and said, “I don't think so” Dara and Wonder Woman and Thor beat everyone together Dara took her parents to Hyppolyta in themyscira island Hyppolyta said with a smile, “My granddaughter and my departed daughter, finally Gods are smiling at us” After a few moments of emotional get together Hyppolyta said to Thor and Diana, “Do you understand that you two should never meet each other? It's not supposed to happen, you two need to get back to your time which means this reality does not exist which means Dara should not exist either” They realised what they needed to do Both of them sent an emotional goodbye to Dara and said, “We are proud of you, Dara, you are even better than us, keep doing what you doing and take care of your own people but you understand we need to go” With the help of Heimdall they get back to their own reality Before Wonder Woman got back to her reality, she said to Thor, “Well, this has been such an unique experience, I will remember this forever” Thor said, “Same here princess” They kissed each other for the first and last time to celebrate their adventure and Diana returned to her time How do you find the costume of Dara?

An 18 year old can buy a bottle of Vodka in the shop (and motorway service station I saw the other day) and drink it down trying to show off and die. There are millions of alcoholics in the UK who’s lives and families lives have been utterly ruined and who are simply unable to get out/off of the addiction. Weed doesn’t do any of this and provides inspiration, help, fun and pain relief to people and grows naturally. It may be a ‘slightly’ different matter for those that opts to lock themselves away and do nothing but smoke heavily and constantly and get nothing done, using cigarette tobacco as well hence damaging their lungs falls. This is a different subject. Alcoholics have been known to resorting to drinking petrol, so anyone taking anything too far legal or not legal is asking for trouble. Weed being illegal v Alcohol and cigarettes not is utterly absurd and the complete opposite of what everyone knows should be the case. There shouldn’t even be any debates on it. Clearly there is tax implications for the economy to ban cigarettes and alcohol, but the massive damage and carnage caused by both seems to be acceptable for the government in return for the money. Maybe they should start making murders legal and taxing people per person that they kill instead of jail, there is not a great deal difference."},{"instruction":"Why don't we have nuclear powered trains, aircraft, and cars?","output":"Why don't we have nuclear powered trains, aircraft, and cars?

I had that same hair style since I was, oh, 3? Here's me at age 23, few days ago: I still don't like being in pictures much, but I don't hate it either.

Though several people have already said what I could have answered, I will still briefly write my views, especially about why the question is worded as it is. Madara needs no introduction, a mere mention of his name could send shivers across the whole Shinobi world. But his power is often misread, in the warring era, as well as during the fourth war. Madara always took on Hashirama during their clan battles. Unfortunately, this fact causes the misdirection that he was on equal footing as Hashirama. When reality is that Madara always lost without troubling Hashirama, and the only time he pushed Hashirama was when he brought Kurama to their battle. On the other hand, as other answerers have pointed out that Izuna and Madara were considered equals, and we have seen that Tobirama quickly downed Izuna as soon as he brought FTG to the battle. Considering the ease with which Izuna was beaten and the fact that Tobirama knew Izuna's fighting patterns from ages of fighting, Tobirama would defeat MS Madara as well, just not as quickly as Izuna. But in general, we consider EMS Madara from the warring era. So, Madara won't still be able to wreck Tobirama.

Therefore, it was significant that a young politician like him was, at first, looking at a future outside the BJP. This even though unlike Jignesh Mevani, whose community mostly remains anti-BJP, Patel came from a pro-BJP community. Clearly, Patel's feelings have changed whether it is due to the cases against him or for the benefit of better political prospects. Having said that, Gujarat always has had a big anti-BJP vote, especially in areas away from cities and among communities like Dalits, Muslims, Adivasis, and OBCs.The serious problem within the (fighting force/bad feelings) is that Congress appears in messy confusion and the Aam Aadmi Party may not have the ground strength to take by force/take control of anti-BJP vote.

However, in the Surat City-based Corporation elections, Patel is said to have strategically backed AAP, helping it make its presence felt in the city.

(Very Folky). More like Oriental Music’s technique, without unharmoniously Scales and Keys. Technique Oriental, Scale + Key Western. The Wah Wah I think spoils it, too superficially used as an add-on after thought, the Wildlife version is special. This Lennon song is very much a “Seattle Grunge” Music Genre, before it was. As a side interest, David Bowie rang Lennon to get the Guitar part right, when he covered the song, Lennon came to the studio to play it, to help Bowie out, a VERY rare uncredited appearance for John Lennon, who felt uncomfortable playing on other musician’s Albums. I think of Bob Dylan’s Subterranean Homesick Blues, A7 Chord throughout, as RAP Music, before RAP Music existed. “Hats Off to Roy Harper”, a Led Zeppelin Song, is a rare example of a famous Band acknowledging a Folk Legend. I loved going to a Folk Club, The Old Brown Cow Pub in Mansfield, Notts, in the upper room, with a tiny bar, as a teenager I loved going, missing the last bus home, hitching back through the night, sometimes unsuccessfully. It was a great shame the way Punk took over, Folk Clubs stopped, the whole Folk scene is just starting to make a come back in England. One of the most astounding facts that always amazes me about Fans, is they seldom acknowledge that Musicians have THEIR HEROES. Loads of musicians that are house-hold names, just love Folk Guitarists, few of THEIR Fans realise this source of their inspiration. Those “Household Name Musicians”, think their heroes are better musicians too, just not commercial like them. I had a “music day” recently, spending all day just listening to my favourite music, I fall asleep, wakeup, fall asleep, wakeup, …while the music is playing continuously all day long, slipping into waking up in the dark. I hadn’t listened to Bert Jansch + John Renbourn playing: Stepping Stones, Soho, and East Wind, for such a very long time. I’d totally forgot just how amazing these Songs, and Instrumentalist pieces are. My admiration for them composing music for two guitars, Cotton Picking, creating an Aural Maelstrom, swirling around each other, pure beauty not loosing their focus on the music, over technique. YES, I DO THINK JOHN LENNON WOULD HAVE BEEN A NIRVANA FAN. I play their unplugged songs all the time, I never tire hearing Kurt Cobain’s voice. Another great loss to our lives. I thought if a child picks up a guitar, they don’t pick up a gun. How wrong was I, Kurt Cobain butchered brutally that gentle, sensitive soul that made our lives wonderful.

Some of the reasons why dogs may develop bad breath include poor oral hygiene, gum disease, digestive issues, and certain medical conditions. Poor oral hygiene is the most common reason for bad breath in dogs. When food particles and bacteria accumulate in their mouth, it can lead to the formation of plaque and tartar, causing gum disease and bad breath.

It occurs when there is an inflammation of the gums due to the accumulation of bacteria around the teeth. In some cases, bad breath in dogs can also be an indication of digestive issues. If a dog has a gastrointestinal problem, such as constipation or acid reflux, it can lead to bad breath. Lastly, certain medical conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver disease can also cause bad breath in dogs. It is important to identify the underlying cause of bad breath in dogs and address it accordingly. Regular dental checkups, teeth cleanings, and proper oral hygiene practices can help prevent bad breath in dogs. Feeding a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can also promote overall dental health and fresh breath.

It is not possible, for example, to isolate one specific variable in an experiment to see how it affects an outcome. Indeed, for many social scientists, it is not possible to create an experiment at all - as an anthropologist I examine large scale social institutions. On a practical level, it is not possible to either run an artificial experiment, or even to capture all of the possible data for a given phenomenon. Experiments are designed to reduce the complexity of what's being examined in order to better understand it. I'm studying branding in Chinese businesses, I'm not really sure how one would create an artificial situation which would reduce the complexity of a large cell phone company that sells millions of phones across an enormous geographic area, and still be representative of what I'm studying in any meaningful way. And, what I'm studying is tied to a specific historical moment of China's economic development, so it is only here for a moment before it will have passed. I don't have the luxury of being able to step into the same river twice. Are we scientific? We adhere to commonly accepted standards of research design, data analysis, etc..

Personally, I don't really care what you call it, its about as careful and systematic a way you could go about answering the questions we examine. So, are the questions we ask worth examining, and do we answer them in a sufficiently careful and systematic way? Critics of the social sciences, who say that we're not \\"real science\\" tend not to have too much in the way of practical suggestions of how \\"real science\\" would answer the same questions social scientists pose, and often don't have too much in the way of familiarity of the work that they're criticizing to begin with."},{"instruction":"w could PDF files be converted to EPUB and vice versa?","output":"Free online PDF converters without installing any software on your desktop such as hipdf, smallpdf or ilovepdf. 2.

It's awesome to see your enthusiasm for starting a weight loss journey. Quick weight loss can be an appealing goal, but it's crucial to tackle it in a way that's both healthy and sustainable. While there's no magical fix, I've got some helpful tips to get you on the right path. Let's kick things off by discussing your eating habits. Prioritize whole, nutrient-rich foods like fruits, veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains. Keep a watchful eye on your portion sizes and try to steer clear of excessive processed foods, sugary treats, and high-calorie drinks. Making water a central part of your routine can be a game-changer – staying well-hydrated can significantly aid in weight loss. Now, when it comes to exercise, aim for a balanced blend of cardio and strength training. Seek out activities that genuinely spark your interest, whether it's running, dancing, hiking, or anything else that gets your heart pumping. This makes it more likely that you'll stick with your routine. And don't forget, consistency is the name of the game! Allow me to share a personal story from my own weight loss journey. Once upon a time, I was dead-set on shedding those extra pounds, but I admit I felt a tad overwhelmed. I decided to start with small, achievable goals – like swapping out my daily soda for refreshing infused water. Admittedly, it was a bit challenging at first, but before long, I found myself craving that revitalizing cucumber-mint combo more than the sugary fizz. I also hopped into a local fitness class, which not only led to some incredible workout buddies but also kept me pumped up with the group's positive energy. Gradually and steadily, I began to notice changes, not only in my weight but in my energy levels and overall confidence. So remember, the journey toward a healthier you is just as important as the destination! Stay upbeat, stay persistent, and you're absolutely capable of achieving your goals!"},{"instruction":"What do you think The Hound and Arya are heading south to do?","output":"Sandor is going south to finish his unfinished business of killing his brother.

The Galatians were those that had fallen into the error that being saved by the grace of God they now had to maintain it by maintaining their own self-righteousness. Galatians 3:3 KJV Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Paul is just stating the fact that if you think you can be justified by the law, even in maintaining your salvation, then Christ died for nothing. Galatians 5:4 KJV Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. As stated in Romans, grace and works are mutually exclusive of each other. Romans 11:6 KJV And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.Romans 4:14 KJV For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: So, what it boils down to is you are saved by grace and your salvation is maintained by grace. Salvation is never by works either in obtaining or maintaining it. Once saved, always saved. The SDA, who say they are saved by grace but are now going through a probation period to see who is worthy to keep their salvation, would be making the same error as the Galatians."},{"instruction":"there an affordable webbased small business accounting software?","output":"Yes, there is a lot of affordable accounting software for small businesses.

The heavy elements in that early mix were made in some previous generation of star that exploded and spread debris everywhere. Because elements like gold are created from fusion reactions inside a star - they follow the chain of fusion - starting at hydrogen, then helium and so on up to iron. The place where gold exists in that chain of nuclear reactions is such that not as much of it gets made as the more common elements. Details are complex - and we’d also have to get into how heavier elements tend to end up more in the middle of planets - but then the Earth got stirred up when it was whacked by the dwarf planet that caused the Moon to form. Bottom line - it’s complicated…but mostly - it’s the way that stars form complex atoms like gold."},{"instruction":"What is the weirdest object you've ever found?","output":"Not sure what this is but my daughter found it in the sea in Singapore today.

About a third of boys went on past School Certificate, a National examination to the sixth form, when they would begin to specialise. In my year, three of us became the pre-medical stream in the final year sixth form. One became a Professor in a highly regarded medical school, one a much loved family doctor, and I became a pharmacist, chair of the Welsh board of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and founder of the Pharmacists’s Defence Association. My sister who went to the Girl’s side of the school ended up chief occupational therapist for a large group of London teaching hospitals and then married the MP with the largest majority in Parliament.

Here are some key factors that can influence blog earnings: · Traffic: The number of visitors to your blog plays a significant role in potential earnings. Higher traffic generally means more opportunities for monetization, such as through advertising, sponsored content, or affiliate marketing. · Monetization Methods: There are various ways to monetize a blog, including display advertising, sponsored content, affiliate marketing, selling products or services, offering online courses, or using membership models. The effectiveness and profitability of each method can vary depending on your blog's niche and audience. · Audience Engagement: Having an engaged audience that interacts with your content, shares it, and provides feedback can be valuable for attracting advertisers and building partnerships. Audience engagement can also lead to higher conversion rates for affiliate marketing or product sales. · Niche Selection: Some niches may have higher earning potential due to higher demand from advertisers or a willingness of the audience to make purchases. Niches such as finance, health and wellness, technology, or lifestyle can be more lucrative compared to others. · Consistency and Quality: Regularly publishing high-quality, engaging content can help attract and retain readers, build trust, and increase the chances of earning through various monetization methods. It's important to note that earning potential varies greatly, and not all blogs generate substantial income. Some bloggers may earn a few hundred dollars per month, while others can generate a full-time income or even more.

On the one hand, buying involves higher monthly costs, but you own an asset your vehicle in the end. On the other hand, a lease has lower monthly payments and lets you drive a vehicle that may be more expensive than you could afford to buy. But you get into a cycle in which you never stop paying for the vehicle. With more people choosing a lease over a loan than they did just a few years ago, the boom in leasing isn’t stopping anytime soon. Buying a vehicle with a conventional car loan is pretty straightforward. You borrow money from a bank, credit union, or other lending institution and make monthly payments for some number of years. A chunk of each payment is put toward paying interest on the loan and the rest is used to pay down the principal. The higher the interest rate, the higher the payment. As you repay the principal, you build equity until by the end of the loan the car is all yours. You can keep the car as long as you like and treat it as nicely or poorly as you want to. The only penalties for modification or abuse could be repair bills and a lower resale value down the road. As car prices rise and buyers start to demand the latest [LINKED_TEXT: car accessories] [URL: https://accessorizeyourauto.com/] safety features that are available only on newer cars, leasing a vehicle has become a mainstream alternative to buying. With a lease, buyers make a monthly payment to drive a new car for a set term. That payment is often less than the monthly cost of financing a new vehicle, but buyers must return the car at the end of the lease term. With more people than ever working from home, the mileage restrictions on a lease may not be a factor for a lot of shoppers."},{"instruction":"have 100k which I want to invest passively.

If you shoot an enemy soldier and you needed a weapon to survive, then maybe you would take their weapon, fully understanding the risk that they might be ID’d as the enemy. My dad was in VN, and different weapons have very distinctive sounds. I would assume if it were a special operation, the plan would be precise enough so that the commandos would carry enough ammo to get the job done with some contingency. I’m not sure what ISIS does, but I think they took US-made weaponry from the Iraqis. Other than that, looting and scavenging weapons is probably in the realm of video games, action movies, and apocalypse TV."},{"instruction":"Can we bake a cake in a glass bowl?","output":"No"},{"instruction":"What is the best way to stand on a crowded NYC subway train?","output":"Standing on a crowded NYC subway train can be challenging, but there are some tips to make it more comfortable: 1. Position yourself strategically: Consider positioning yourself on the platform to board either the first car or the last car on the train. Those cars are usually less crowded than others. 2. Move quickly: Try to move quickly and get yourself out of the way of other passengers when boarding or exiting the train. 3. Stand in the middle: It's better to stay in the middle until the train is stopped at your stop. 4. Ride in certain cars: Ride in the first subway car or the middle car with the conductor. The first few cars of the train tend to be more crowded. 5. Keep foot traffic orderly: When walking, keep to your right to help keep things moving in an orderly fashion.

If we use 80% of the brain, we will be in ICU, I suppose. Why? Because we are using maximum parts of brain through out day and night. And when we use 80%, it means something is wrong and hence ICU. The truth is we in a way use full brain. Most of the people think we use brain only in maths, physics, logical reasoning, crime mysteries, testing the boy friend, getting a girl friend, etc. But the fact is that we use brain for everything. For instance, for reading this answer, walking, judging the speed of ball, using hands, sensing temperature, etc. Allow me to elobrate. Suppose you are walking and as well as talking on your phone. When the conversation turns important you unknowingly stop walking. Guess why? Because you are multi tasking. When you stop walking the load on your brain reduces and it can focus on the conversation that is important. Brain is a tool. And we have a scope to use it better than we actually do. But that does mean we will start communicating with snakes, if we use brain's full potential."},{"instruction":"What is your opinion of Adam Schiff presenting indisputable evidence that the Trump campaign did in fact collude with Russia and criticising the GOP?","output":"Trump works for Putin.

Some of the things I am about to write here may melt some hearts, and others may break some. I loved Mumbai and its people thoroughly when I lived there and I endorse Mumbai as a place to live in happily to anyone who asks, albeit with a bit of caution. The GOOD: Image Credit: [LINKED_TEXT: Mumbai] [URL: http://wanderpants.com/mumbai] Mumbai is Beautiful beyond belief (in its own special, endearing way). There is no way you can remain as angry, upset or in agony as you were if you go to places like the Queen’s necklace and sit by the sea -it is just breathtaking - the dichotomy between a bustling, fast, no-nonsense city life and the calm induced by the sea is fantastic! Not to forget, compared to so many places in India, the weather is amazing for most part of the year. Image Credit: Free license image on Pixabay 2. The People are simple, honest and helpful. Narrating something that I witnessed in a local train from Andheri to (don’t remember the station name): I got on to a choc-a-bloc jam-packed, sardine tin can type packed local train at Andheri in the morning. Bear in mind that during rush hours, you can barely hop on and well, be pushed off at any station if you’re standing close to the exit. I made my way to the center of the coach and held on to the overhead hand rail for dear life and limbs, when all of a sudden I hear a gentleman shout “Hello! Hello! Boss aapka purse, aapka purse!” Translation: (Hello! Hello! Boss, your wallet, (you forgot) your wallet!) I gaze up to find a man board the train just as it is about to pull away - the man is obviously pushed farther into the coach than he intended. Panting, he stretches his hand out to a middle aged gentleman standing a couple of sardines away from me and says “Kya boss, kidhar dekhta hai, tumhara purse udhar station pe gira. Ab main idhar phass gaya - gaadi chal padi” Translation: “What the F, Boss, where is your attention? Your wallet slipped out on the platform. I wasn’t supposed to get on the train and now it’s moving and I’m stuck.” I beamed with pride - Mumbaikars are legendary in their honesty and simplicity. I looked at the guy and smiled - He probably thought I was a retard or took a liking to him, but all it was was the feeling that if I could lose my wallet somewhere in this country and could hope to get it back, it was Mumbai.

This is Dharavi, a slum society. Not a perfectly accurate indicative of the level of dirtiness all around, but a reasonable indicator nonetheless. Mumbai is dirty beyond belief too. Sadly, there are areas that are so dirty, that you struggle to place your feet anywhere on the ground while walking. I used to live in Andheri East, more specifically, Sahar - the area near the Airport. It was extremely dirty, and even more so during the monsoons.The Mumbaikars seem to be okay with the filth. Okay, before you lose your cool, let me tell you Delhi is very dirty in places too, and that is not a consolation. The problem here is, Mumbaikars in general come across as much more sensible and literate people than Delhiites, for example. Why are they not able to form consensus on the fact that Mumbai needs to be cleaned up, and do something about it? The GIST: You may or may not like Mumbai initially, but trust those who tell you that as a place, Mumbai grows on you. The people are remarkable, the food delicious and its spirit so alive and bustling that being there changes you as a person, for the good. This is precisely why its drawbacks irk one so much - this city could be perfect, it just barely stops short.

Do you think it makes a big difference if you get Coke or Pepsi?","output":"A few years ago, (many? - I don’t remember exactly when) I think one of the executives from Coke went into a restaurant and asked for a Coke. He was served a Pepsi without being told beforehand. Coca-Cola sued and won. And that is why waiters and waitresses everywhere are told to tell people they server Pepsi and not Coke products and vice-versa. Now, this may sound rather petty, but you have to understand a little about Trademark laws to understand why this is actually a big deal. I learned about this when I used to work for Xerox. If the word “coke” were to fall into popular usage as a catch-all name for cola-based products, Coca-Cola would be in a position to lose their trademark for the term “Coke” if they don’t do everything they can to protect it. That is why that lawsuit was so important. Xerox had major problems protecting their trademark because so many people would say “go make me a xerox of this” instead of “go make me a copy of this”. Or go xerox this. Xerox is a trademark, not an action or noun, and someone saying “Go Xerox this” when they were using a Canon or other brand copier has a tendency of weakening the trademark Xerox holds. The same holds true for tissues - Kleenex. The term Kleenex has come to mean any tissues used for blowing your nose, regardless of brand because (I think it was them) they didn’t protect their trademark well enough. And that is why companies are so fierce about protecting their Brand Name from improper usage."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","output":"The next recession is imminent. But it’s going to be a different kind of recession. Let me explain… For almost 40 years, we’ve lived in an era of low rates and easy money. It let governments and businesses worldwide run up piles of debt. Global debt could easily reach 500 trillion in a few years. And yet everyone acts like that is normal and can continue. Just like subprime mortgage debt triggered the last recession, corporate debt will trigger the next one. This will start a liquidity crisis and create havoc in all sorts of “unrelated” markets.

Debt is a drag on future growth. And the amount of debt the world now has will be a monster drag on future growth. Recessions always bring higher unemployment, on top of technology-driven job losses. This will worsen the current political tensions. Humans want scapegoats. Many will blame markets and capitalism, when we have neither free markets or true capitalism. The progressive left’s siren song will begin to play everywhere. They’ll promise guaranteed basic income, free college, free everything, etc. If you haven’t already heard of the economic insanity called Modern Monetary Theory or MMT, you will. It says we don’t need to worry about government debt. We should simply monetize it. Create and spend whatever we need for the common good. They produce fancy equations and rationales, but monetization is the bottom line. It’s essentially what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others in her world espouse. They talk about raising taxes on the rich. But there’s simply not enough money to do what they propose—even if you take everything the rich have. [LINKED_TEXT: The arithmetic doesn’t add up.] [URL: http://www.today.unaux.com/how-to-make-money-taking-surveys-online/?i=1] So they will add more debt and eventually monetize it. Which is exactly what Japan has done, and seemingly succeeded. Politics Will Drive Everything US government debt will easily reach 30 trillion within three years after the next recession. Once we begin the next economic experiment, another recession will come shortly. Markets will be even more distresses. And the debt will soar to 40 trillion. Pensions and government deficits will be completely upside down. And then the real fun will begin… quantitative easing on a scale that makes the Bernanke years look like an elementary school picnic. We will simply have no choice. Now, the world will not come to an end. Markets and most businesses will figure out how to survive. New businesses will keep launching. New technologies will thrive. We will continue to need food, shelter, transportation, communication, and all the things we think of as normal today. This will all happen while technology “eats” jobs faster than it creates them. It was all well and good when we went from 80% of the workforce on farms to 1% today. But that happened over several generations and centuries.

Definition: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United States in the year noted. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The differences between the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries are generally much smaller. Now let me tell you in easy words.Let's say Bangladesh makes one hundred dollars in total, but this amount is made by a few industrialists. And let's assume Pakistan makes 80 dollars but not by some big industrialists, instead it is made by many. Now the GDP size will tell you that Bangladesh is making more money and the Mooney made is divided by number of all people. That would show you high per capita income. And Pakistan will be shown with less per capita income.Now come to purchasing power parity economy.

Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon: Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.” (Isaiah 30:8-13) It’s used for inspiration and motivation, “And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.” (Isaiah 5:12) Is when they lie to themselves, “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

They are quick, convenient, and easy to use. However, there have been concerns about the safety of cooking food in a microwave oven. In this article, we will explore the potential health risks of cooking food in a microwave oven and whether it is safe to use. What is a microwave oven? A microwave oven is a kitchen appliance that uses electromagnetic radiation to heat and cook food. It works by emitting microwave radiation that excites water molecules in the food, causing them to vibrate and generate heat. This heat is then transferred to the rest of the food, cooking it from the inside out. Potential health risks of cooking food in a microwave oven There have been concerns that cooking food in a microwave oven may have negative health effects. However, the scientific evidence is inconclusive and most studies have found no significant health risks associated with microwaving food. One concern is that microwaving food may cause it to lose nutrients. While it is true that some nutrients may be lost during cooking, this is not unique to microwaving. All cooking methods, including boiling, steaming, and baking, can cause nutrient loss. However, microwaving may actually be a better cooking method for preserving nutrients in some foods, such as vegetables, as it cooks them quickly and at a low temperature. Another concern is that microwaving food may cause it to become carcinogenic. Some studies have suggested that microwaving food can produce harmful compounds, such as acrylamide and heterocyclic amines (HCAs), that are linked to cancer. However, these studies have mostly been conducted on animals and the results are not conclusive. Furthermore, cooking food at high temperatures using other methods, such as grilling and frying, can also produce these harmful compounds. There have also been concerns that microwaving food in plastic containers may release harmful chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA), into the food. While it is true that some plastic containers contain BPA, the amount that is released during microwaving is very small and unlikely to cause harm. However, it is still recommended to use microwave-safe containers, such as glass, ceramic, or plastic labeled as microwave-safe. Is it safe to use a microwave oven? Overall, the evidence suggests that cooking food in a microwave oven is safe for most people. However, there are some precautions you can take to minimize any potential risks. First, make sure you use microwave-safe containers and avoid using plastic containers that are not labeled as microwave-safe. This will help prevent harmful chemicals from leaching into your food. Second, make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions and use your microwave oven properly. Never operate your microwave oven if the door is damaged or if the seal is broken, as this can be dangerous. Finally, be sure to cook your food thoroughly and use a food thermometer to ensure it reaches a safe internal temperature. This is especially important for meat, poultry, and fish, which can harbor harmful bacteria if not cooked properly. Conclusion In conclusion, cooking food in a microwave oven is generally safe and poses no significant health risks. While there have been concerns about nutrient loss and the formation of harmful compounds, these risks are not unique to microwaving and can be mitigated by proper cooking techniques and the use of microwave-safe containers. As with any cooking method, it is important to follow food safety guidelines and cook your food thoroughly to ensure it is safe to eat.

Today, as part of its planned Humanitarian Program, the government allocates places each year to refugees and others with humanitarian needs.[LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn1] There were 13 750 places allocated under Australia’s Humanitarian Program for 2009–10 (an increase of 250 places on 2008–09 planning levels). This comprised 6000 planned places for the resettlement of refugees under the Refugee category mostly referred to Australia by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and 7750 planned places under the Special Humanitarian Program (SHP). Australia’s focus for the resettlement of refugees in 2009–10 continued to be on those from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn2] While many are aware that Australia accepts a certain number of refugees and other humanitarian entrants each year, there is a great deal of misunderstanding on the details of Australia’s humanitarian responses and the complex visa arrangements for refugees and humanitarian entrants. Often the critical distinction between the places allocated for ‘refugees’ (people subject to persecution) and those allocated for humanitarian entrants (people subject to substantial discrimination) is blurred. This is compounded by the fact that the Humanitarian Program numbers are comprised of both onshore and offshore applicants. This means the 7750 places currently allocated under the SHP are shared between offshore humanitarian applicants and refugees granted onshore Protection visas (including those processed on Christmas Island) and immediate family members of Humanitarian and Protection visa holders already in Australia. Similarly, few understand the difference between Australia’s obligations owed under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the 1951 Refugee Convention) which are met through the onshore component (asylum seekers applying for protection within Australia, including on Christmas Island) as opposed to its voluntary involvement in the resettlement of ‘refugees’ referred by the UNHCR which Australia does through the offshore component of the Humanitarian Program.[LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn3] Other misunderstandings in the public debate arise from confusion between the offshore component and the ‘offshore’ processing of asylum seekers on Christmas Island. This is not assisted by the latter being counted as part of the onshore component while those previously processed extraterritorially under the ‘Pacific Solution’ were mostly counted under the offshore component of the Humanitarian Program. The aim of this Background Note is to provide greater clarity by tracking the development of Australia’s humanitarian responses. This then provides a context for examining the main criteria and processes for entry under both the refugee and humanitarian categories of the offshore component and refugee entry under the onshore component of the current Humanitarian Program. Some recent settlement initiatives for refugee and humanitarian entrants are also briefly examined.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn4] This paper also explains some key terms (in appendix A) and includes statistics back to 1945 (in appendix B). Part I – Background Overview of Australia’s humanitarian response since 1945 Australia’s first Commonwealth immigration department was established in July 1945. Subsequently, Australia resettled thousands of post-war refugees from Europe and ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention on 22 January 1954. Prior to the 1970s, Australia’s approach was to respond to humanitarian crises as they arose in the international arena with a focus on assisting refugees ‘offshore’.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn5] However, with the arrival of the Indochinese ‘boat people’ on Australian shores seeking ‘onshore’ protection in the 1970s, the Government saw the need to assess the existing practices and develop a refugee policy specifically designed to respond to refugee and humanitarian issues.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn6] The then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Michael MacKellar, announced that Australia’s first refugee policy would be based on the following four principles: Australia fully recognises its humanitarian commitment and responsibility to admit refugees for resettlementThe decision to accept refugees must always remain with the Government of AustraliaSpecial assistance will often need to be provided for the movement of refugees in designated situations or for their resettlement in Australia, andIt may not be in the interest of some refugees to settle in Australia. Their interests may be better served by resettlement elsewhere. The Australian Government makes an annual contribution to the UNHCR which is the main body associated with such resettlement.[LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn7]In 1977 the Fraser Government introduced a Humanitarian Program to administer the new policy and respond to the Indochinese humanitarian crisis (and any future crises) in an orderly manner. The program included the establishment of mechanisms to determine onshore protection claims and it was intended that the program would provide the structure whereby future humanitarian intakes from both ‘offshore’ and ‘onshore’ could be planned and controlled.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn8] Since the 1970s Australia has adapted its refugee policy in response to various humanitarian crises (for example, following the Tiananmen incident in China). These changes included developing the means to assist asylum seekers who did not fit into the strictly defined ‘refugee’ category. Until the 1980s, almost all arrivals under the Humanitarian Program were refugees. In 1981 the Fraser Government introduced the Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) to assist people who did not fit neatly into the ‘refugee’ category, but who were subject to human rights abuses and had family or community ties with Australia.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn9] The SHP, together with the refugee category, marked the beginnings of the annual program that we have today. In June 1989 a Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) was adopted at the International Conference on Indochinese Refugees held in Geneva in response to the flow of asylum seekers from Vietnam and Laos. Australia, under the Hawke Government, was one of 51 nations that endorsed this agreement.[LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn10] Between 1975 and 1991 Australia accepted more than 130 000 Indochinese refugees.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn11] Between 1989 and 1991 there was an increase in people claiming refugee status due primarily to the Tiananmen Square incident in China in June 1989—most of the Chinese applicants in the country at the time were allowed to stay by the Hawke government.[LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn12] There were 16 248 protection visa applications during 1990–91, with about 77 per cent coming from Chinese nationals.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn13] By the early 1990s, a comprehensive refugee system was in place within the immigration portfolio and in January 1993 a decision was made by the Keating government to officially separate the Humanitarian Program from the Migration Program.[LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn14] In 1996 the Howard Government introduced the practice of specifically identifying and linking the onshore and offshore components of the Humanitarian Program ‘to improve program management’.[LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn15] This meant that ‘offshore refugee and humanitarian’ and ‘onshore protection’ were separately identified and included together in the same program, ‘Humanitarian and Refugee Resettlement’ for the first time. Before that, onshore protection was included under the ‘Onshore Program Delivery’ program while the refugee and humanitarian sub-program was included under ‘Offshore Program Delivery’.[LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn16] In addition, the Howard Government introduced the practice of setting aside quotas (planned places) for ‘onshore’ places: For the first time, a federal government had set aside a quota for refugees arriving in Australia without prior application. Before then refugees had been assessed on the basis of need rather than on the number of places available.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn17] Since then practices have varied in terms of planning, managing and counting the onshore or offshore components of the Humanitarian Program. Currently, onshore visa grants are not specifically allocated planning places (they are shared with the overall planning figures for the Humanitarian Program each year). Australia has continued to respond to global resettlement needs as they have arisen. These have included those resulting from the Balkan crisis in 1991 and from wars and unrest in the Middle East and Central Asia—mostly Iraq and Afghanistan. In 1999 the Government created the temporary safe haven category to deal with Kosovars and East Timorese who had been displaced by upheaval in their country (DIAC subsequently granted 5900 Safe Haven visas to Kosovars and East Timorese in 1999–2000). From 2003–04 to 2006–07, Australia’s focus was on resettling refugees from Africa. In 2003–04 over 70 per cent of refugee resettlement grants were allocated to Africa and 24 per cent to the Middle East and South-West Asia (down from 40 per cent in 2002–03).[LINKED_TEXT: [18]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn18] In more recent years the priority focus has been more evenly spread between Asia, the Middle East and Africa—in 2008–09 each region was reserved an allocation of 33 per cent under the offshore resettlement program.[LINKED_TEXT: [19]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn19]Iraqis received the largest number of grants under the 2008–09 humanitarian program with 2874 visas granted, followed by Burmese (2412) and Afghans (847).[LINKED_TEXT: [20]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn20] Refugee and asylum levels and trends There is a great deal of confusion about the difference between an asylum seeker and a refugee and often the terms are used interchangeably or incorrectly. An asylum seeker is someone who is seeking international protection but whose claim for refugee status has not yet been determined. In contrast, a refugee is someone who has been recognised under the 1951 Refugee Convention to be a refugee.[LINKED_TEXT: [21]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn21] The vast majority of people seeking asylum, 75 to 95 per cent, remain in their region of origin, thus placing the burden on neighbouring countries. Four out of five refugees reside in developing countries. According to the UNHCR: The available statistical evidence demonstrates that most refugees remain in their region of origin and flee to neighbouring countries. Indeed, the major refugee generating regions hosted on average between 75 and 91 per cent of refugees within the region. UNHCR estimates that some 1.7 million refugees (16 per cent out of the total of 10.5 million) live outside their region of origin.[LINKED_TEXT: [22]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn22] For example, in 2008 Pakistan was host to the largest number of refugees worldwide (1.8 million), followed by Syria (1.1 million) and Iran (980 000).[LINKED_TEXT: [23]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn23] Some asylum seekers do make their way to countries in other regions. The UNHCR summarises trends in the number of individual asylum claims submitted in 44 industrialised countries in Europe and selected non-European countries each year. In 2009 these countries received an estimated 377 200 asylum applications.[LINKED_TEXT: [24]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn24] Around the world most asylum claims are lodged in Europe, the USA and Canada. More asylum claims are lodged in Europe (particularly in France, Germany and the UK) than in any other part of the world.[LINKED_TEXT: [25]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn25] Asylum claims in Europe have remained stable over the last three years with 286 700 asylum claims in 2009; 283 700 in 2008; and 249 600 in 2007. In 2009, the largest number of asylum claims for an industrialised country was in the USA with 49 000 claims, closely followed by France with 42 000 and Canada with 33 300 claims.[LINKED_TEXT: [26]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn26] In comparison, a relatively small number—6500 claims—were lodged in Australia and New Zealand combined in 2009.[LINKED_TEXT: [27]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn27] The UNHCR also provides indicators of the capacity of destination countries to host asylum seekers. These include statistics on asylum applications as a proportion of the population and GDP per capita. In terms of individual share in the total number of asylum applications received per 1000 inhabitants, Australia had 0.2 asylum applications per 1000 inhabitants in 2008. In these terms, Australia was ranked number 22 out of the 51 countries that were included in the UNHCR report Asylum levels and trends in industrialized countries 2008. Australia was ranked number 24 per 1 USD/GDP per capita for 2004–08. The less prosperous countries of Cyprus and Malta were the ones that received the highest number of applications compared to their national populations in 2008. France and the USA received the highest number of applications per capita compared to their national economies.[LINKED_TEXT: [28]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn28] In summary, Australia’s resettlement of refugees and processing of asylum claims are small in the context of these international trends. In terms of our individual share of the number of asylum applications received by industrialised countries only a small number are lodged in Australia (6500 claims were lodged in Australia and New Zealand combined in 2009).[LINKED_TEXT: [29]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn29] In terms of refugee resettlement, Australia’s contribution is also modest. As noted by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in an address to the Lowy Institute in July 2010: Last year, Australia received 0.6 per cent of the world’s asylum seekers. Refugees, including those referred for resettlement by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, make up less than 8 per cent of migrants accepted in Australia. Even if all those who arrived in unauthorised boats were found to be refugees—which they will not—they would still be only 1.6 per cent of all migrants to Australia.[LINKED_TEXT: [30]] [URL: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/SeekingAsylum#_ftn30]"},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"To start making money online with affiliate marketing, follow these key steps: Choose a niche:Select a specific topic or industry that you're passionate about and has a sizable audience.Join reputable affiliate programs:[LINKED_TEXT: Partner with established companies offering products or services related to your niche] [URL: https://rn132.isrefer.com/go/quickstart/NjmaxAmo5/Quora1].Create valuable content:Produce high-quality blog posts, videos, or social media content that educates and engages your target audience.Promote affiliate products:[LINKED_TEXT: Integrate affiliate links naturally into your content to encourage purchases] [URL: https://rn132.isrefer.com/go/quickstart/NjmaxAmo5/Quora1].Build an audience:Focus on driving traffic to your content through SEO, social media, and email marketing.Monitor and optimize:[LINKED_TEXT: Track your performance and adjust strategies to increase conversions and revenue] [URL: https://rn132.isrefer.com/go/quickstart/NjmaxAmo5/Quora1]."},{"instruction":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, “Nope, not worth it” and just left?","output":"No. I always investigated."},{"instruction":"w do I talk like a native English speaker?","output":"You can talk like a native speaker by using some apps with a correct direction like HELLO SHRAA.

And because of bugs you’re not even able to make a simple microservice work good all of the time, and you’re not even able to read code you wrote yesterday… Then you realize that… you need to slice all your code and loops to put them into even more unnecessary and unreadable callbacks, because this piece of shit won’t even do preemption, nor provides a function to do it. So you end up “guessing” how much time the code will take and how “long” the callback needs to be :D Then you pick greatest, most recommended library just to hear that it’s greatest, because it takes “only 10ms” instead of 100ms to do something … but it still isn’t working as expected or isn’t working at all. And the community is so lazy and clueless, that programmers are forced to do this code-butchery and work with not-working libs, for the last 10 years! Because that’s obviously too little time to add a simple yeld and most basic MT functionality which will work as intended.

These tattoos have meaning to Jungkook, I could go all day about that, but that’s not the point of the question. Jungkooks tattoos are art. They are special to him. Each tattoo has its own story, and each of them are important to him. He wanted to get them spontaneously, and I love that. We should too. At least he didn’t get them without any meaning, right? Whenever someone thinks badly about tattoos or piercings, I always tell them this: “Yes, they are permanent, but they are beautiful. Yes, they are scars, but they are art. Yes, people will talk, but who cares? It’s their body, not yours. Their life, not yours. Their reputation. not. yours. Just because they have body modifications, doesn’t mean you should see them differently.” Hell, if Jungkook posted something about getting another tattoo, I’d probably send him some that I’ve drawn for myself, with full permission to use them.

For example, a series of View Controllers whose number, order, and content are determined not at compile time, but at run time based on a dynamically transmitted config file. Storyboards don’t really do well with this concept, they are much more ideally suited to situations where your user interface is pre-determined and fixed (with a few minor exceptions)."},{"instruction":"Was Beethoven a prodigy?","output":"It does not matter.

Can anyone imagine any of them practicing proper procedures for handling, storing, distributing and destroying classified documents?

This is the same concept as God. First of all, after reading many answers I came to the conclusion that “There is no perfect Definition of Karma” It’s vary from person to person depending upon their experiences. What is Karma? (Google definition) (in Hinduism and Buddhism) the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence is viewed as deciding their fate in future existences. Let’s break down it into two parts: 1st part: The fate of a person is being decided by his actions in this life and his past life. How could a person's past life affect his present life? Isn’t it Nonsense? There is no past life. It’s just garbage created by so-called ******. When they don’t have answers and they automatically bring the concept called “Past Actions” How foolish it is to believe such lame concepts. How could a person's past deeds affect life actions affect his present life? There is truth in it. We should accept it. But, doesn’t happen to everyone? Nope. If we do good deeds they will reciprocate. It’s true up to some extent. But at the end of the day, humans are humans. (I will write about it in the next paragraph.) 2nd Part: Decides fate in future existences? Another foolish concept like Past life. (Image source: Google) Does Karma happen to everyone? Osama Bin Laden, a heinous terrorist, died at the age of 55 happily (a single headshot). Do you think it’s karma? If yes, Then answer this A good and beautiful lady was attacked with Acid by her boyfriend as she wasn’t accepting his love. Is it Karma? What’s the mistake done by her? Does she deserve this? or Children being born to Alcoholic, Abusive, Non-concerned fathers. What do you say? or A person helped his friend in need but later one ditched him when he needs help. Now?? Conclusion: If any good happens to good ones, there is God. If bad happens, nobody questions God. Nobody is there to answer. If bad things happen to bad people, Karma does exist. If bad things happen to good people, No one mentions Karma. Now also, there is No one to answer. That’s why karma is a similar concept to God. Vary from one to one. Once you accept “Good and bad events happen to everybody and part of life”, then there is no point in believing concepts like “Karma & God” “If you are good, there are high chances of life being good to you”. That’s the simple funda of life. Whether you call it Karma, Goodness, Nature or Real life, it's up to you. ~V!"},{"instruction":"What is dropshipping?

Nithier one would have much effect on earth. But the moon explosion would create a very small amount of fallout on earth. But probably far less than from Chernobyl and certainly Fukushima.

So, they set it up very carefully in 1887, all physicists in the entire world were eagerly awaiting the results because it was obvious that they would succeed… …and they didn’t get a result. The meter stubbornly and persistently read Zero, even though they, and every physicist in the world, agreed that the meter was in perfect working order. (Yes, it’s a bit more complicated, but that was the essence of it.) It took almost twenty years until someone could explain the lack of a result. You’ve heard of the person, you’ve heard the name of the explanation. Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. And that’s how science works. People set up some sort of experiment. They get a totally different result from what everyone expected. There is much excitement, and eventually, someone figures out why.

While luck may play a role in individual outcomes, long-term success requires a more calculated approach. Here are some essential factors to consider: Research and Analysis: A solid understanding of the sport, teams, players, and statistics is crucial. Analyze past performance, form, injuries, head-to-head records, and other relevant factors to make informed decisions.Bankroll Management: Sensible money management is vital. Set a budget for betting and avoid placing large wagers on single events. Sticking to a strategy and avoiding chasing losses can help protect your bankroll.Specialize and Focus: Trying to bet on every sport or market can lead to diluted knowledge. Specialize in a particular sport or league, focus on a few select markets, and develop expertise to gain an edge.Avoid Emotional Decisions: Sports evoke passion, but emotional betting can cloud judgment. Separate personal biases from rational analysis and make objective decisions based on evidence.Shop for Value: Compare odds across different bookmakers and seek out favorable prices. Identifying value bets with higher odds than expected increases the potential for long-term profitability.Adapt and Learn: Sports betting is an evolving landscape. Stay updated with trends, rule changes, and new strategies. Continuously evaluate and refine your approach based on experience and learning. Remember, successful sports betting requires patience, discipline, and a commitment to ongoing improvement.

And like Haiti one hundred and fifty years earlier, the remaining whites would be driven out or killed. Slaughtered. And one could argue deservedly. Really, after the war the good burghers of Atlanta should have erected a largish statue of William Tecumseh Sherman, square in front of their town hall, in gratitude for having saved their descendants from either lives of extended misery in some cold Northern city, Or a swift and bloody end at the hands of some machete wielding ex-slave. Instead, they kept trying to be as ass hole as they could under the new rules. Hardly ever, in the history of the world, was such a clear cut path to repentance been shown a people. Or so thoroughly repudiated. Anyway. It’s not slavery. It’s capitalism. Capitalism is the worst of all masters. It treats slaves the worst, because it is not the value of the slave, but only the profit which can be extracted from his labor. Capitalists breed their slaves until there are too many, and their value crashes. Then toss them away when their use is no longer profitable. In an over populated world, slavery is no longer useful to minimize the wage bill to the capitalist elites. The capitalist need no longer pay even subsistence wages. Cheaper just to use and use up labor."},{"instruction":"lost my email password.

To be honest, that had some really bad effects on me. I was scared, and had hallucinations for a month. Whenever I entered a dark room, I saw a little girl hanging herself. It was horrible. However, I am grateful that my parents didn’t try to shelter me, and rather exposed me to all sorts of things themselves. By the age of 10 I had watched IT, Insidious, the horrors of Amytsville (or something like that, I don’t quite remember) all the Annabelle movies, The Exorcist, and many more. I am glad I watched horrors at such a young age. It made me understand what the real world is like. I also enjoy horror movies by myself now (more appropriate ones, violence isn’t a big deal, but I select ones with no explicit scenes), at the age of 12. (I am turning 13 in a matter of days though, like my birthday is 20 days away) So thats my answer. It honestly depends on your kid. If your kid is strong enough to take the horror or r-rated items, then show it to them yourself, rather than waiting for them to find out from an inappropriate source.

Everyone needs to find a strategy which suits his / her personality and preferences the best. Some people like to trade within a few minutes and some are more comfortable using the full trading session to exit their positions. Now, I am going to share some of the points that I always keep in mind while trying my hand at intraday trading. The first and foremost thing is to identify a trading opportunity and that can be either a sudden positive or negative news about a particular stock or sector or technical indicators that suggest that a long or short position should be entered. One should certainly know the basics of technical analysis for making short term trades. Knowing about technical charts, technical indicators and how they can be used to enter and exit out of positions are some must-knows when doing intraday trading. Another very important thing to keep in mind is that one should always determine stop losses before entering an intraday position. Since the position is intraday, the position cannot be kept for delivery and therefore, one should if the loss that one is willing to take before the end of the day. Then, there are some techniques that I use to find out when to enter a long or short position. One of the best-used techniques is the [LINKED_TEXT: intraday trading formula] [URL: http://bit.ly/2KZMTNR] using pivot points. A pivot point is a technical indicator that is used in determining the price trend of a stock or index. It is calculated by adding the high as well as low prices of the previous trading day to the closing price of the last trading day and dividing the whole sum by 3. Then, a comparison of the pivot point and the current market price should be made. If the current stock price is greater than the pivot point, then, it can be assumed that the resistance level is about to be reached and a trade can be initiated accordingly. If the current stock price is less than the pivot point, then, it can be assumed that the support level is about to be reached. The calculation of resistance and support levels can also be done using simple formulae. Also, this is the link which talks about this particular strategy in detail. Please check out the detailed answer on this link - [LINKED_TEXT: A Digital Blogger's answer to Which is the best formula most using intraday traDing?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-formula-most-using-intraday-traDing/answer/A-Digital-Blogger-2] If you are interested in taking stock market courses like a course on technical analysis and technical indicator and oscillators, then, you can refer to the mobile phone app called Stock Pathshala.

A dofollow link is used in the first case, and a nofollow link in the second. Although both types of links link from the origin site to the destination site, they communicate two different messages to the search engine.Let's talk about the distinctions between [LINKED_TEXT: dofollow vs nofollow] [URL: https://seoagilitytools.com/Nofollow-VS-Dofollow] backlinks as well as their uses. A Dofollow Backlink: What Is It? In terms of SEO, a dofollow link is one that transfers the authority of the source site to the destination site. It is known as \\"link juice\\" when authority is transferred. Getting dofollow backlinks will help a website's domain rating, also known as its domain authority, which in turn will help it rank higher for relevant keywords. There is no requirement for rel=\\"dofollow\\" when linking to a website because links are dofollow by default. A Nofollow Backlink: What Is It? A nofollow link, also known as a backlink, is a link that doesn't give the website it's linking to any authority. In terms of SEO, these links are useless. When linking to a website, add rel=\\"nofollow\\" to the code to make the link nofollow. When is a nofollow backlink appropriate? If you don't want to pass link popularity to or support the linked website, use a nofollow backlink. For instance, when comment spam started to be a problem in 2005, search engines began to recognise nofollow backlinks. Links in comment fields could be made nofollow by webmasters so that the website wouldn't benefit from link spam. For sponsored links, affiliate links, or user-generated content, you might also want to use a nofollow link. How to Identify a Dofollow Link Simply inspect the link in the browser and look at the HTML code to determine whether it is dofollow or nofollow. Right-click the link in the browser and choose \\"Inspect\\" to do this. This will display the link's associated HTML code. The link is a nofollow link if rel=\\"nofollow\\" is present. If rel=\\"nofollow\\" is not present, the link is a dofollow link. You can use a backlink analysis tool like Ahrefs or Moz in addition to the inspect tool."},{"instruction":"What is it called when near the end of some yoga classes they have you just lay flat on your back for a bit?","output":"Hi, The asana is called Shavasana or “the dead body pose”.

I studied it from the viewpoints of science, history, languages, archaeology and prophecy. Conclusion? It is true.

Restaurants always generate a fair number of colorful stories, but at buffets, people seldom act their best. Technically, some of these are more appropriately “breaking” the rules, but are only possible because of the rules at a buffet. Buy breakfast /lunch, stay for dinner. I worked in a senior-heavy area for a while. In a day where I'd serve 1000 people from 11-10, I'd ring up 300-350 in the hour before dinner started. Most of them wouldn't even bother snacking in a salad. Just sit and wait.Feeding kids from an adult plate. If the sign says 3 and under eat for free, you have to pay for your 6 year old. Sorry.Packing food into a bag. This was the worst. Some buffets(like GC) have provisions for take out. Use them. My standard line (borrowed from one of my trainers) was “stay as long as you like, eat as much as you want, but you can't take it with you.” We also never harassed anyone taking that last cookie or muffin out the door. Generally, if you had it in your hand, you're still eating your meal.Skipping the line. People would send their family through the line to pay, then show up ten minutes later needing to use the bathroom. After, they'd go straight to the table where plates had already been dropped off. If it was busy, only the sharp waitresses would catch it, and half the time they wouldn't risk their tip by saying anything.Intentionally hogging (perceived) expensive items. I count this as abuse even though only the rooky managers and people who don't see financials ever care. Buffets sell build - your - own meals, not “the best deal you ever had on steak.” Sure, you build your meal AROUND as much steak as you want, but we count on people eating green beans and mashed potatoes, too.The reason anybody with a clue doesn't care about number 5 is because of this one. All you can eat encourages people to take piles of food, sometimes before they even know if they like it. At a full serve restaurant, people order carefully and seldom send something back in exchange for a different item. At a buffet though, trash it with zero penalty. If all the food we prepped was eaten with only employee - generated waste (like some of what's left at night, the odd overcooked item, breakage, whatever), we could have made buckets of money. That's the real reason GC went to smaller plates. Not because they wanted people to eat less(i heard that LOT at the time) , but because they wanted you to eat what you took. Tons of ways for buffets to lose money, but these are the ones I can think of that abuse any rules inherent to buffets."},{"instruction":"f you were given 20 million dollars in return for never eating red or white meat again, would you be able to do it?","output":"No"},{"instruction":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","output":"Don't be rude to your parents Never stop analyzing urself Never ignore your health and ur attire Never share ur secrets with anyone Don't forget to plan your day Don't stop learning Never lessen ur self esteem Never underestimate anyone Don't forget to smie :)))"},{"instruction":"w do you vote with your dollars?","output":"By refusing to spend a dime on any woke Company."},{"instruction":"What is it like to have a good/best friend of the opposite gender?","output":"I was looking for a good question to write something about him here in Quora!

Whenever I leave my hometown in a bus/ train , my dad always drops me to the station. He leaves the place only after ensuring that I got my seat and after giving me a proper send off :P This is something I cherish the most. Though the journey you take is all alone, it kinda gives a reassurance and warms your heart when you have someone to see you off. As you can guess, my friend also does the same thing whenever he is in town. Drops me to the bus stop, scolds me for not coming well in advance, and finally sends me off with a wink and miss you dialogue! Having a good/best friend of opposite gender is usually like going on a fun ride with all precautions, and occassionally getting a glimpse of how the opposite sex brain works! He knows most of my heartbreak stories, gives me a shoulder to lean on and most importantly teases the hell out of me and makes me laugh! Years in my life would have been so boring if not for him!

It's a good idea to book your accommodation in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons. 3. **Visit the Giza Plateau**: The most famous and iconic pyramids are located on the Giza Plateau, a short distance from Cairo. The Giza Plateau is home to three major pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure. 4. **Guided Tours**: Consider booking a guided tour to explore the pyramids. Qualified guides can provide valuable historical and cultural insights, enhancing your overall experience. They will also ensure you see the most important areas and landmarks. 5. **Transportation**: To get to the Giza Plateau, you can use various means of transportation, such as taxis, ride-sharing services, or public transportation like buses or the Cairo Metro.

It makes efforts of the native powerful and into the right direction.When the same planet gets retrograde , confidence on self is gone.Jupiter may start getting confused about his own decision and may leave the things that is started but then again picks up the same thing. Retrogression makes the native to repeat the things.Jupiter in the 2nd house may make the person repeat his/her acts for earning the wealth.Native may speak very fast or repeat himself/herself again and again.Native’s eyes may have to be corrected by the Glasses if not placed in the positive sign.Jupiter aspects the 6th house so it also gives Native the debts whose EMI is to be paid repeatedly. Disease which requires day to day care.Aspect on 8th house gives native the situations where he/she has to transform himself/herself.Aspect on the 10th house gives the connection to the work place where repetition of the work place is there. Native may be related with the service sector and repeated pattern of the work.Repetition is the main characteristics of the Retrograde planet. Here we have to check in which sign it is placed and which planets are aspecting the 2nd house. Position of the 2nd house lord is also necessary to check. This is a generalized answer and proper answer can be given only after analysis of the birth chart. Interested persons can contact me for detailed and thorough analysis of the birth chart.

When it comes to look, durability, etc., they both have benefits over one another. Granite v/s Marble 1 Durability: Granite’s is comparatively more durable and hardy than marble. It is frequently compared to marble as the most resilient natural stone. It is ideal for kitchen tops since it resists heat and can readily handle hot cookware. Additionally, marble is prone to color fading and dulling with time. A stone that has lost its brilliance cannot be restored, in contrast to stains that can be. It is a permanent process and marble's main flaw. 2 Reactivity to Acidic Substance: Both natural stones are porous, but marble is more porous due to its metamorphic characteristics. As a result, marble is easily damaged by spills, especially those involving acidic liquids like fruit juices and wines.”— [LINKED_TEXT: Roma Imperiale Quartzite] [URL: https://www.quartzite-stone.com/] 3 Appearance: Granite and marble have very diverse looks from one another. Because feldspar, mica, and amphibole are mixed in with granite, the stone's color variety appears as speckling throughout. On the other hand, marble has veins going through it and is a greyish or cream tone. Marble veins are typically caused by contaminants like iron oxide. 4 Applications: Marble is more suited for areas with lower foot traffic, such as restrooms, whereas granite is more acceptable for kitchen counters and hallways where there is considerable foot traffic. Marble is ideal for surfaces that get less use since it has a unique, vivid appearance. 5 Cost: Due to the weight of the slabs, installation of granite and marble must be done by professionals. Marble and granite are both generally 50 to 100 in price, although high grade granite is less expensive than marble. The actual cost, however, is determined by the type of tile used, the complexity of the project, and the quality of the stone. 6 Maintenance: To stop etching and staining, sealants are used to both marble and granite. Professionals advise sealing marble twice a year, whereas once every two years is sufficient for granite. Marble requires considerably more frequent sealing. The exact need for resealing depends on how frequently the stone was cleaned and how heavily it was used."},{"instruction":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","output":"The morning is the best part of the day .

Despite her birthright Queen of the realm chanting, Dany wasn’t actually heir to the throne. Viserys was. She only became heir to the iron throne because she made it so. She had her brother brutally killed, usurping the throne from him, and then callously remarked that because he died when they poured the molten metal over him, she justified it by saying that he must not have actually been a true Dragon (re: Targaryen) because he died that way. She wasn’t horrified by murdering her brother and staging a coup. She was smug and unfazed by the violence, and then continued to be cruel, unforgiving, and unfazed by violence. Her actions against her brother weren’t really provoked. He was the king (in their mind) and the engaged the Dothraki to have an army to reclaim that throne. She took it upon herself to defy him and to undermine him, and then was offended that he would have taken it personally. She then decided to envision herself as the Queen instead of him, and thus chose to overthrow him so she was in position to rule. She betrayed her family. She betrayed her duty. She took what wasn’t hers. Sansa, on the other hand, was the victim of an abusive husband. She was raped and tortured by him. She watched him do the same to Theon. She watched him murder her brother.

It’s only an algorithm. It can only spot patterns it’s programmed to spot, and what copy editors do is far more nuanced than that. Frankly, if you took every suggestion Grammarly Premium gave you, much of your writing would be just as bad off (if not worse) as it was to start. To properly use Premium, you have to understand (or at least be willing to look up and learn) things like when it’s OK to use a tautology, what a dangling modifier is (and when it’s OK to leave it), specific style issues you’re expected to adhere to (not all dictionaries or outlets use the same spelling of a word — e.g., anti-fungal vs. antifungal) and that it’s not always wrong to split an infinitive (among many other things). It also can’t always determine part of speech accurately, which makes a difference. Later in this very answer, I say, “Grammarly will catch words you use too frequently…” Grammarly is telling me it should read “catchwords.” And that would be true if I said, “Using these types of catch words can confuse readers.” Because in this instance, catchwords is a noun. In my sentence, “catch” is part of the verb and “words” is a noun. More, if it falsely identifies part of speech, it can also advise you to put a comma where none belongs. And it happens frequently and many are subtler than that, meaning a novice writer wouldn’t just automatically know Grammarly was wrong. There are many subtleties to language it’s not able to understand. I do believe it could be set up to understand any dictionary you choose or any style guide you choose. I even believe they can make it more customizable to accommodate house style. They could even expand its capabilities to have better sensitivity to parts of speech. But there’s one problem with that. Fixing syntax, punctuation, and spelling aren’t all copy editors do. Text that takes you 20 minutes to read could take us an hour (depending on how many problems we identify) because we also look at the following: Logic: Is this argument logical and cogent? Are there holes in the materials or does it rely on logical fallacies like ad hominem remarks, begging the question, slippery slopes, strawmen, or hasty generalizations?Facts: Is the text factual? Is it OK to wash raw chicken? Did the study really conclude that? Is that really how the Red Flags Rule works? Did they really say that the way you’re presenting it?Omissions: Why does this recipe say to add the green onions? There are no green onions listed in the ingredients. OK, so I should itemize my tax return if I have deductible receipts over the standard deduction amount. But what’s the standard deduction amount? How does Rachel know Taylor has the locket? She was at the doctor’s office when Ryan gave it to him and she just got back? In a mystery novel, that might be a clue. In another, it’s an omission if you don’t explain it.Overexplanation: Yes, sometimes, writers also overexplain things. Once you make your point, you have to move on. But sometimes, people do drone on and on.Inconsistencies: Earlier, you said the best rate of return you’d gotten was 5%. Now you’re saying it’s 15%? Which is it? Also, is it “internet” or “Internet”? You have to spell and style it the same way each time.Repetition: Grammarly can catch words you use too frequently in a single passage. But it can’t catch that you’ve made the same point three times unnecessarily.Organization: One of the most common problems with writing is simply organization. Things don’t flow well from point to point, there are issues with random headers that don’t have partners, the info is out of order altogether and some points would be more easily understood if you put a latter point first, etc. Grammarly’s trying to keep you from making a stupid mistake. It can’t tell you whether humans will understand your flow.Clarity: The clarity of individual sentences does not a clear point make. Clarity involves many of the other issues on this list, but essentially, when the reader is done, will they know who, what, when, where, how, and why?Word Use: Grammarly technically checks for this. But it gets a lot wrong (I’ve never once had it suggest “instead” for “rather” and had it be correct… Not. Once.). Moreover, Grammarly can’t know how certain words really work together or whether a word choice is overstated for the situation, even if it does go with that word, especially in more technical or subject matter-driven works. Just because the thesaurus tells you a word can be a synonym doesn’t mean they mean the same exact thing. I think that’s fixable, but I also think it would take a metric crapton of manpower of the professional linguist variety and many years to make it happen, and it would still be incomplete since there are subtleties and language changes so quickly and you can’t account for everything. In fact, I think that’s why they need a more robust personal dictionary/style editing system.Wordiness: Why say “in order to” when “to” works just fine? “Period of time”? Or would just “period” do? Why say, “I have an appointment with my doctor,” when you could just say, “doctor’s appointment”? If it’s “needless to say,” you don’t need to say, “needless to say” (and you might not even need to say it at all). Do you know how often I remove an irrelevant “that” from works? And those are just the common types of wordiness.Sensitivity: Grammarly can’t check your sensitivity, which can be a very important thing. It does have a tone checker, which is good for emails I guess? But sometimes, even that’s wrong. It’s just basing it on the words you use. The other day, I wrote a Quora answer about yeast and it told me I was being “forceful” the minute I started talking about how yeast dies. Good luck if you’re talking about a sensitive subject like suicide, mental health or matters of race. It can’t catch text that would be offensive when it’s subtle.Objectivity: Just because you say it well doesn’t mean it’s objective. Even if you manage to avoid logical fallacies, you can still insert bias (yes, no matter how “liberal” you think you are — no political ideology is synonymous with “objective”).Flow. Is everything presented in a logical order? Is there a variance in word usage? Do they show a mastery of the subject matter and the language? Other elements we look for cover some of this, but flow has to do with how it all works together. Grammarly can give you clues to word usage variance. But it’s often wrong. If the writer is talking about interest in terms of finance, I don’t care how many times the word is used in that passage — you still have to use it if it’s the right word, and no, interest and APR aren’t interchangeable. They aren’t the same thing. Plus, half the time, it prompts me to use something like “concern.” Moreover, repetition is also a literary device, and it’s not always wrong. And Grammarly can’t show you how it all works together. I’m sure I’m missing something, but that at least gets the point across. I use and love Grammarly. But no, it can’t replace me right now and not for the foreseeable future. (As I post this, Grammarly is showing me 10 nonexistent errors (adjusted for errors it’s reading because I was using them as examples) based on the style guide I used to write it and missing a purposely introduced incorrect serial comma since the style guide I used eschews them.)"},{"instruction":"Could Superman literally knock out a human heavyweight boxer with one flick from his finger?","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ?

Just consider that firearms technology has been from the very beginning driven almost entirely by empirical experiments: Ie, what Actually works best, by trying it. At long ranges, a smooth but symmetric point (like those mostly conical rifle bullets) gives better accuracy and range. Interestingly, the rounds with the best ‘ballistic coefficient’ (measure of goodness at staying fast at long range) tend to have ‘sharp’ *tails*, rather than heads. If the bullets were sharper, it would be easier to damage the point, and even a tiny dent at the point would lead to that same bullet wanting to wander, even if spin stabilized. Shot to shot, the performance of such bullets is likely to be not repeatable. There might be some benefit to super-sharp pointed bullets, but it would be difficult to notice, and it might come with significant cost or reliability downsides, or even cause more worse problems. Consider that a gun with a magazine and a lot of recoil tends to smack all the bullets in the magazine on their noses with every shot: This isn’t going to do a fine sharp point any favours, so you’d only be able to really use such a bullet where this can be avoided. Blunt bullets just don’t care, but your shot to shot accuracy with sharp points is going to be worse and worse with each sequential shot fired: The very last bullet has been smacked on the nose by as many impacts as there were other bullets, and so has probably changed shape more than all of them, but they’d each be different, and this would make shooting with precision very difficult. If there isn’t at least precision, you can forget accuracy. Also, repeatedly forming bullets to accurately the same sharp shape is just difficult to do, with too pointy tips. There is actually a kind of bullet that has a ‘sharp’ edge, all around it: Wadcutter and semi-wadcutter bullets. In this case the ‘edge’ is really just a 90 degree step ‘shoulder’ about the bullet, but it’s plenty sharp enough to make that bullet act like a hole punch, and knock nice clean-edged holes in target cards. The lack of ‘sharpness’ of a wadcutter bullet doesn’t hurt precision at all. They’re still spin-stabilized, and they’re typically only fired at subsonic speeds at quite short ranges. The only other reason to want sharp bullets is if you consider them the tips of a spear, and want the sharpness to maximize damage/penetration on impact. In this case, there are such rounds, but they’re intended to piece armour. Plain old lead balls are plenty ‘sharp’ to flesh when they’re moving fast enough. But even there, a semi-wadcutter shaped tip seems to work well - think ‘crayon shaped’, with a flat point, a conical nose surrounded by a sharp shoulder just around the edge. Also think ‘crayon shaped’ as in with long stem. c.f. [LINKED_TEXT: TAOFLEDERMAUSWe create original videos, many of which are viewer-suggestions.

They also try out anything anyone can think of - including a lot of shapes with ‘sharpness’. Modern military grade bullets usually have internal ‘penetrators’ which are generally cylindrical and skinny, maybe with some taper, but usually also a flat point. There are made of a very hard and dense metal, which would be too heavy to use for the whole projectile - and would also damage the barrel when fired. The famous APFSDS tank cannon round is probably the sharpest in use."},{"instruction":"w do you create a for loop in Visual Basic that asks the user for 2 numbers, the second higher than the first, than adds the numbers in between and outputs the answer?","output":"For Loops do not ask a user for information. So first you’d need to prompt for the start number and the end number. With VB you’d likely use a Form with some fields on it. You’d want to use an If statement to ensure that the second number is greater than the first value. If not, tell the user to fix the numbers. The For Loop can then calculate the the sum. Start the For loop with your first value and end it on the second value. Use variable to keep track of the sum. Here is some pseudo-code: Dim sum As Integer For num As Integer = firstNumber To secondNumber sum = sum + num Next"},{"instruction":"Do sunset towns still exist in America where only whites are allowed after dark?

It is not done very often anymore simply because the statistics show that “reading the law” is simply not as likely to get you to pass the bar exam as completing a college curriculum. Many college enrolled aspiring attorneys additionally intern in law offices and thus get the advantage of both the college education and some degree of what those reading the law get. The last set of statistics I found were from 1919–1921. Those who had college degrees pass the bar exam at 78%, those who “read the law” passed at 28%.

Both fast food chains offer a range of menu options, including burgers, fries, salads, and other items. Here are a few factors to consider when making a choice: Taste and preference: Taste is subjective, and different people have different preferences when it comes to fast food. You may have tried both McDonald's and Burger King before and have a preference for the taste and flavors offered by one of them.Menu options: Consider the specific menu items offered at each chain and whether they align with your dietary preferences or any specific dietary restrictions you may have. Both chains have expanded their menu to include healthier options like salads, grilled chicken, and vegetarian or vegan choices. Assessing the menu options and nutritional information can help you make a more informed decision.Ingredients and sourcing: If you have specific concerns about ingredients or the sourcing of food, you may want to research and consider factors such as the use of antibiotics, additives, or organic options. Each chain may have its own practices and policies in these areas.Convenience and availability: Consider the convenience and accessibility of each chain in your area. The proximity to your location, drive-through availability, or delivery options may influence your decision.Personal health and wellness goals: If you have specific health or wellness goals, it's important to consider how the options at each chain fit into your overall dietary plan. Fast food should generally be consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. It's worth noting that frequent consumption of fast food, regardless of the chain, is generally associated with health concerns due to its typically high calorie, fat, and sodium content. If possible, it's advisable to prioritize home-cooked meals or healthier dining options that offer a wider variety of nutrient-dense foods. Ultimately, the decision between McDonald's and Burger King should be based on your individual preferences, dietary considerations, and overall health goals. It's always a good idea to make informed choices and seek a balanced approach to your overall diet and lifestyle."},{"instruction":"ve you ever been judged for your appearance?","output":"I am very much into the goth style and i have experienced a lot of discrimination for it. with colleagues i am asked if i am depressed, at shops people follow me around because they assume i am stealing and when i try and be polite (ie. picking up something for a stranger) all i get is a glare. it is quite annoying"},{"instruction":"What are some of the best blogging tools?","output":"SeoToolAdda is a group buying platform for SEO tools.

It wasn’t even close and the driver blew the light big time and caused 2 other cars to skid and swerved to avoid hitting it. When I approached the vehicle I observed the female driver squirming around and ordered her over the PA to put her hands to the wheel. The drama started as soon as I got near the window. “ oh officer I’m so sorry ( tears, near hysterics ) “I’m having an emergency “ The driver then produced a white dish towel that was on her lap. It had “ blood” smears on it. She informed me that she was having her period and had to get home as she always has a heavy flow. After gagging and throwing up a little in my throat, I told her how reckless she was driving and to calm down and drive safely and let her go without a ticket as I just wanted to leave. At after work beers with the boys from work, I told the story and one of the guys said “ holy shit! Blonde in a black BMW!??” He said she pulled the same exact thing on him a few weeks ago. About a month later, a girlfriend of one of our crew was telling him how one of her teacher friends keeps a towel under her car seat with tempra paint from school on it because she “gets pulled over a lot” Between her blonde hair and the BMW she was easy to spot and “reportedly” was being “pulled over a lot” for various minor but expensive violations."},{"instruction":"Where has Indian media gone wrong?","output":"News media is supposed to be one of the important pillars of democracy.

Jaime sees very early on that the Wench is calm and capable, if a bit stoic and quiet. I think he would have a grudging respect for her if she was a young man, but as she is a woman he is quite intrigued. He watches her actions and her body very closely. He calls and thinks her ugly, yet he still watches. Imagining her in Cersei's dress (not flattering), offering to wash her back (long before the bath). He wants to interact with her (unlike Cleos who he is not interested in conversing with) but Brienne is not having it, calling him a Kingslayer, which in turn starts to get to Jaime more and more. As for Brienne, she is stoic and mostly loathes him, but cleans him when he is sick and soiles himself after losing the hand. She is gentle (gentler than Cersei, surprise) after the Bath. Jaime goes back to rescue Brienne after having a weirwood dream (never included in the show). A lot happens in the dream and there are many interpretations, but most importantly, Cersei and Tywin leave him (Tyrion is absent from the dream) and it's Brienne who stays with him when the dead come. Then, if we skip to where the books and show really started to differ: Jaime gives Brienne the sword, and although they have a bit of a fight (Jaime is upset that Brienne doesn't realize what he means) they remember each other quite…fondly. Brienne goes off looking for Sansa but finds Lady Stoneheart (resurrected Cat) instead. On the way there she remembers Jaime and wishes he was with her. She dreams of him (both fevered dreams and not) where he replaces Renly and a former would be suitor (who rejected her) Ronnet. She also meets some of the bloody mummers, and avenges Jaime. Jaime has already turned Cersei down before Tyrion tells him (in the midst of a very ugly fight) that not only has Cersei lied to Jaime, but she has been sleeping with heaps of men, including their cousin and Jaime's brothers from the kingsguard. Jaime starts his long road (but not nearly as long as Show Jaime's) towards independence. After a lot of fighting and disagreeing, Cersei sends him away (to end a siege, which he does without any bloodshed) and he goes willingly. Both are very disenchanted with each other. Jaime thinks on Brienne a lot (especially when topic of sex or procreating comes up), and has many feelings. He's trying to deal with his realization that Cersei was never The Maiden, but The Stranger. He punches Ronnet (Brienne's former betrothed) with his golden hand for insulting Brienne, and then sends him on an errand so he does not have to look at him anymore. Cersei needs help and sends a cheesy message with many “heartfelt\\" I love yous. Jaime has it burned in the fire. Later, Brienne comes and he scrambles up. She claims to have found Sansa (though it's Stoneheart she found), and Jaime leaves with her. For these, and countless other reasons, it is clear that not only is theirs a romance in progress, it's also the one GRRM has devoted the most time and pages to.

It allows individuals to grow their wealth, achieve financial goals, and secure their future. However, with numerous investment options available, it can be overwhelming to decide where to invest. In this article, we will explore the best ways to invest money, considering factors such as risk tolerance, financial goals, and investment time horizon. Table of Contents Understanding the Importance of InvestingIdentifying Your Financial GoalsAssessing Your Risk ToleranceDiversifying Your PortfolioInvesting in Stocks and EquitiesExploring Bonds and Fixed-Income SecuritiesReal Estate Investment OpportunitiesThe Power of Mutual Funds and ETFsInvesting in Precious MetalsCapitalizing on CryptocurrenciesExploring the Foreign Exchange MarketThe Role of Certificates of Deposit (CDs)Building an Emergency FundTaking Advantage of Retirement AccountsSeeking Professional Financial Advice 1. Understanding the Importance of Investing Investing is essential for building wealth and generating passive income. It allows your money to work for you, instead of letting inflation erode its value. By investing wisely, you can achieve financial freedom and secure your future. 2. Identifying Your Financial Goals Before you start investing, it's crucial to identify your financial goals. Whether it's buying a home, funding your children's education, or retiring comfortably, your goals will determine your investment strategy. 3. Assessing Your Risk Tolerance Investing involves some degree of risk. Assessing your risk tolerance is crucial to choosing investments that align with your comfort level. High-risk investments may offer higher returns but come with greater volatility. 4. Diversifying Your Portfolio Diversification is the key to mitigating risk. By spreading your investments across different asset classes, industries, and geographical locations, you can protect your portfolio from significant losses. 5. Investing in Stocks and Equities Stocks and equities represent ownership in companies. Investing in the stock market can provide substantial returns over the long term, but it also carries higher risks. 6. Exploring Bonds and Fixed-Income Securities Bonds and fixed-income securities are relatively safer investments that offer regular interest payments. They are suitable for risk-averse investors or those seeking a steady income stream. 7. Real Estate Investment Opportunities Real estate investment can be an excellent way to diversify your portfolio and generate rental income or capital appreciation. It involves owning properties for long-term growth. 8. The Power of Mutual Funds and ETFs Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) pool money from various investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. They offer convenience and professional management. 9. Investing in Precious Metals Investing in precious metals like gold and silver can act as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. They have intrinsic value and are considered safe-haven assets. 10. Capitalizing on Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have gained popularity as alternative investments. They are highly volatile but can offer significant returns for investors willing to take the risk. 11. Exploring the Foreign Exchange Market The foreign exchange (forex) market involves trading currencies. It can be a way to profit from changes in exchange rates, but it requires a deep understanding of global economic trends. 12. The Role of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are low-risk, fixed-term deposits offered by banks. They provide higher interest rates than regular savings accounts and are ideal for short-term savings goals. 13. Building an Emergency Fund Before venturing into investments, it's essential to build an emergency fund. This fund acts as a financial safety net for unexpected expenses or emergencies. 14. Taking Advantage of Retirement Accounts Retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, offer tax advantages and can help you build a secure retirement nest egg. Start contributing early to maximize compounding growth. 15. Seeking Professional Financial Advice If you feel overwhelmed or unsure about investing, seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor can provide valuable insights tailored to your unique financial situation. for more interested information [LINKED_TEXT: click here] [URL: https://www.rusancoguide.com/2023/07/why-is-it-important-to-incorporate.html] Conclusion Investing money wisely is a powerful way to secure your financial future and achieve your life goals. It's essential to understand your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon before embarking on any investment journey.

And you haven’t paid for that bike out of your own pocket, it’s been issued to you. Or . . . . . . if you’re a VERY good and talented amateur racer who’s competing with the intention of being noticed by some level of professional team and hopefully being offered a contract . . . . . it might give you just enough assistance to get noticed over all those other riders trying for the same thing. Then again, if you’re truly talented, you’ll perform well enough on a ten year old bike that a team will notice you anyway. Otherwise, you’re showing off and wasting your money. Since the mid-1970’s (at the end of the Bike Boom), among all the ‘improvements’ and ‘advancements’ in bicycle technology there have only been TWO that have significantly advanced bicycle performance. Everything else has just been an excuse to get you to buy a new bike. Brifters. And (mechanical, cable-operated) disc brakes. The former does make shifting easier (coupled with the earlier indexed shifting which made brifters possible). And the latter is more effective in all sorts of weather, but especially in rainy or muddy conditions than any form of caliper brakes, including cantilevers. Note, I said mechanical disc brakes. Yes, hydraulic disc brakes are even more powerful, but I’ve always felt you’re talking a level of improved results that doesn’t keep up with the increased complexity and setup involved in the system. Don’t believe me on the ‘wasted advanced technology’ bit? Let’s go out on a nice 40-mile Sunday ride. You ride whatever you want, I’ll take one of my late 80’s Rossin’s (Columbus lugged steel, indexed Shimano Dura Ace or 600 Tricolor, or non-indexed Campagnolo Nuevo Record, depending on which bike I take). I’m willing to bet how we perform is going to be way more dependent on our individual physical conditioning than the bikes we’re riding.

Sadly - A Persistent Inflation Exists Across America. While inflation fell to 6.5% in December from a peak of over 9% in June 2022, it’s still well above the Fed’s target rate of 2%. Although the Biden administration is adamant that inflation will continue its downward trend, other economists and financial experts aren’t so sure.

AKA - buying high and selling low.

We haven’t even read anything with these characters, but people are acting like they're the worst character ever created. Don’t get me wrong, they look awful, and the names are incredibly cringy, but take a breath. We’ve seen this type of stunt before, we’ll see it again. Both DC and Marvel have a history of trying to grab onto the hot button issues of the day and creating characters based what is happening in the world. Sometimes you have massive successes like the X-Men, other times you have characters that flop like….like… you know what? I can’t think of characters like that off the top of my head. Because they faded from the shelves and were never referenced again. Also keep in mind, the writer is known for being a writer for Stephen Colbert. I wouldn’t be surprised if this series has a healthy dose of satire. I’m not saying that will save the title, but it’s possible these characters are all going to be tongue in cheek. That being said, I’m still not looking forward to it. It’s yet another New Warriors book. Since the first volume, I don’t think a New Warriors title has made it past 12 issues. . Champions was a much better teen team book than most that Marvel had put out recently. And while I loved the last New Warriors series by Yost, it still failed to bring in readers. The New Warriors have run their course. And this title will no doubt die a fast death.

In order for the transaction to pass and be recorded in the blockchain, a certain transaction fee is taken. It varies from coin to coin and depends on multiple factors which we will analyze in this article. The main purpose of a transaction fee is to make sure the transaction is validated to keep the corresponding platform running and developing – thus, to secure transactions. While we usually think of a transaction fee as the network commission of a certain cryptocurrency, that is, one operational transfer of its coins to another address, it’s also worth considering other types of fees that currently exist. This is Cryptocurrency with lowest transaction fees Vertcoin: 0.002 dollars fee in average.Bitcoin Cash: 0.0025 USD fee per transaction.Dash: exchange fee equals 0.0051.Litecoin's fee is 0.042.DOGE: while Doge itself costs less than a dollar, its transaction fee of 0.242 remains extremely low.

And I put it in my coffee, that comes from half-way around the world to delight my senses of smell and taste. And I can drive to and from the grocery without even having to shift, beyond putting the car in drive — and, if the weather’s good, with the press of a single button, I can drop the top.

I can stop in the middle of an answer and play “Maria Maria” by Santana, or Beethoven’s Quartet in A minor (with the hints of resolution in the adagio) at any hour of the day or night, or read a good book on a Kindle. If my wife does something that I think is amusing, I can call her sister, more than 3,000 miles away, and share the tale with her. Or if I forget a name of someone I used to know, I can look up their identity in various ways (address checks, records on the internet, etc.) and remind myself, and then, if they are still with us, get in touch with them through e-mail or social media or whatever.

They are required to research to identify the problems and come up with solutions. 2. They are also required to implement the confirmed plans and monitor the execution at different departments. As business analysts, it is their responsibility to narrow the gap between IT and the business. 3. They have to articulate the ideas regarding that how data- driven changes in any of the business processes, products, or services can help in enhancing efficiency. 4. In addition to these responsibilities, they have to provide financial insights on the use of capital and help in decision- making. Business Analysts connect with business leaders and stakeholders. It is their foremost responsibility to understand what stakeholder needs and pass these prerequisites to the developers. Furthermore, also communicate the developer's expectations from the business.

I'm taking .5 mg regularly to help me sleep.","output":"After wife of late Soundgarden frontman blamed anxiety medication for his suicide, questions remain as to the drug’s side effects On Thursday morning, news broke that Chris Cornell, the groundbreaking singer who helped shape grunge, died by suicide the night before in his Detroit hotel room. Cornell’s unexpected death shocked family, friends and fans, some of whom watched the 52-year-old vocalist and guitarist perform with Soundgarden hours before he passed. A local medical examiner ruled the cause of death as suicide by hanging. Cornell’s wife, Vicky Cornell, released a statement on Friday morning remembering her late husband and father of three children, and also calling into question what may have led to his death. According to Vicky, Cornell may have taken more than his recommended dosage of Ativan, a medication used to ease symptoms of anxiety. During one of their last phone conversations, Cornell seemed “different” and was “slurring his words,” according to her statement. He had told her he “may have taken an extra Ativan or two,” which prompted her to call security to do a welfare check. What is Ativan? Ativan is the brand name for lorazepam, a type of benzodiazepine medication used foremost to treat severe anxiety and panic disorders in the short term. Benzodiazepines – or “benzos,” as they’re commonly called – are a broad class of highly-addictive sedatives that “have some effective medicinal uses,” said Dr. Joseph Lee, medical director of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation Youth Continuum. (The experts interviewed by Rolling Stone spoke generally about Ativan, suicide and their alleged link. None of them have reported a connection to the Cornell family.) In addition to anxiety, Ativan and other benzodiazepines such as Xanax or Valium can be used to treat seizures and substance withdrawal symptoms, as well as help with sedation during medical procedures, Lee tells Rolling Stone."},{"instruction":"What is the best thing I can do before I die?","output":"I think the Answer of this question changes accordingly with the age of a person.When I was 17 since then I have been asked the same question in my life several times and I have seen that after a quite long time my answer to the same question changes.

That was not their objective. They were sent to explore the outer solar system, which they did magnificently, revolutionising our understanding of the gas giants. After that, of course, they just kept going. To interstellar space. The spacecraft had plenty of power to relay signals. The Deep Space Network talks to them every day. They are expected to have enough power to communicate with the Earth for perhaps ten years more. All the non-essential instruments like cameras were switched off long ago to conserve power, but the spacecraft are still returning a wealth of data about their environment. The interstellar phase of their journeys is a resounding scientific success. We now know so much more about the heliopause, the heliosheath and the interaction between the Sun and interstellar space than we could ever have known without the Voyagers.

String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows to choose the details."},{"instruction":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","output":"This is a truly inspirational story: Dr. Achyuta Samanta - Educationist and Activist. “I know the feeling of a burning sensation in stomach when we are hungry. I have lived it,” he says. And he had lived it for 21 years. Dr. Achyuta Samanta with the students of KISS- image: [LINKED_TEXT: India's Largest Independent News Service] [URL: http://ians.in/] NDTV - Documentary on K.I.S.S. - [LINKED_TEXT: YouTube] [URL: http://youtube.com/] Dr. Achyuta Samanta is from Cuttack, Odisha. He was four years old when he and his six siblings lost their father. The siblings, with their widowed mother, grew up in abject poverty. He went on to earn a Master’s degree in Chemistry, became a chemistry lab-assistant and teacher in Chemistry. Dr. Achyuta Samanta went to create Kalinga Institute for Industrial Technology (KIIT), but more importantly, he is also the founder of KISS - Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences. What makes his effort probably unparalleled is what KISS is doing today. KISS is a residential school that provides education, hostel facility and takes care of students’ health - all for free. The number of students who are enrolled at the Institute is mind-boggling. Today, the number of children is 25,000 (twenty-five thousand, just in case people may think the number written is an error). image: [LINKED_TEXT: WorldNews] [URL: http://wn.com/] - The image is a snapshot of Nat-Geo documentary on KISS - The kitchen is so massive, National Geographic made a documentary on it: Watch it for the sheer logistics needed to feed over 25,000 people - for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The children are provided free meals thrice a day. This one factor alone is a reason why the rate of child marriage in the tribal areas (where the children hail from) has dropped dramatically. The free meal provided is sufficient reason why the drop-out rate is near zero. KISS doesn’t just provide free education or meals, it provides other training as well. Sports is one such field. KISS regularly produces national champions in various fields. One of the national rugby player is a product of KISS, and there are some archers and athletes also coming up in martial arts and other fields.

A blood pressure reading of 138/83 falls within the prehypertension range.

It is important to monitor your blood pressure regularly and make lifestyle modifications to prevent it from progressing to hypertension. It is also worth noting that your pulse rate of 52 beats per minute falls within the normal range for adults, which is typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute.

A kamikaze is a guided missile, but with a human “guidance system”. If your human-directed “missile” takes out a large ship, it “worked”. And it only cost one pilot with a few days of training + some fuel + some explosives + a not-otherwise-useful aircraft. Ultimately, war is rooted in a sort of brutal economics.

You will understand the mistakes you did and how to avoid them in the final exam. Keep Admit Card Ready – IPMAT admit card is a mandatory and important document. Keep one photocopy of the Admit card ready in your bag and carry it to the exam center along with one valid photo ID. Sleep Well – While you might remember to revise every topic and concept, it is equally important to take a good sleep before the exam. A sound mind is strong to solve the complicated problems. Meditate – If you feel nervous and jitters at the last moment, the best resort is to meditate and forget every other issue causing stress. On the D-Day Reach Test center on time – Candidates are advised to reach the test center at the time mentioned on the IPMAT admit card. This year due to the spread of COVID19 virus, there are chances that the exam might be conducted from Home in Remote Proctored mode, however the final decision rests with the University. Stay Calm – It is important to stay calm and do not panic once you reach the test center. Your chaotic behavior will cause further anxiety and as a result you would be restrained from performing at your best in the exam. Cooperate with the Staff – If you happen to reach the Test center, it is important to cooperate with the staff engaged in checking of the items that you brought to the test center. Patiently wait for your turn to come at the computerized verification in the exam hall. Show your IPMAT admit Card and one valid photo ID at the entrance as it is mandatory for candidate’s verification. Time Management – Time Management is the key. It is important to select the important questions that hold relevance and you are confident about. Leave the questions that hold the possibility of inviting negative marking. Revise the Exam – Remember, that after completing of IPMAT exam it is important to revise all the questions carefully, before submitting the exam in the end. Tips During Exam Mental calculations- Try to focus more on mental calculations as this will save a lot of time. Do not forget short answer (SA) questions- In IPMAT 2020 question papers, along with MCQs there will also be short answer questions. Candidates should try to attempt those as there is no negative marking for it. Don’t stuck on single question- Keep in mind instead of doing 1 question in 4–5 min you can able to solve two questions in this time frame which you have not seen yet. So try to see all question and be very careful on question selection as it is crucial key to crack IPMAT. IPMAT Indore comprises of 2 sections namely – Verbal Ability and Quantitative Ability. Here is the list of topics from each section which you must revise 2-3 days before the exam:- Verbal Ability: Reading Comprehension, Synonyms, Antonyms, Jumbled Sentences, Para Completion, Word Usage, Phrase Replacement and Fill in the Blanks.

It is calculated by dividing an individual's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The resulting number is used to classify the individual into various categories: Underweight: BMI less than 18.5 Normal weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9 Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9 Obesity (Class 1): BMI 30 to 34.9 Obesity (Class 2): BMI 35 to 39.9 Morbid Obesity: BMI 40 or higher As a fitness coach, I certainly take BMI into consideration, but it's not the only metric that matters when assessing a client's health or designing a weight loss program. BMI is a simple, easy-to-calculate number, but it doesn't differentiate between muscle and fat, and it doesn't take into account things like body composition, distribution of fat, or overall fitness level. For example, a muscular athlete might have a high BMI, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are overweight or unhealthy.

So, I will do. Personally I almost never found Brutalist architecture ugly but I am fully aware many people didn’t like it to the point of making it an unpopular style. My first “encounter” with a typical public building designed at the end of the ’60s and built and put in operation in the ’70s it was with the Virginia Marini Theatre in my little Alessandria. An obscure provincial town in the north west of Italy, where I was born, and that in the ’70s was still somehow prosperous but progressively declined up to “Half-dead” status of today. LOL! This is the Marini Theater : As you can see, a typical brutalist boxy building with the classic Paul Rudolph’s fluted concrete design pattern. Something that by all means became an icon of many brut concrete buildings around the world. When the building was completed a tsunami of critics were there. In our small town was NEVER seen anything like that before! All that horrible concrete…that boxy shape…and blah blah blah. Me - I loved it :)) I became immediately fascinated by that building. At the same time I remember I went seeing The clockwork Orange, a Kubrick's masterpiece with parts of the movie shot in a place in the UK where brutalist buildings were just been made. It was a second hit for me. Double Love! After that, I become more and more interested in architecture. I studied as quantity/building surveyor and later joined architecture in Turin, which I didn’t fully complete due to my working commitment. While I was in Turin had chances to see the Fondazione Agnelli, another masterpiece of brutalism. Here it is: Probably another building which captured many critics , rightly or wrongly, by many. Brutalist architecture may not initially giving you a sense of warmth. Sure, it’s far from being a New Mexico style architecture or a neo-classic or even a baroque BUT let’s be honest. What would have you built in the ‘60s, ’70s and even ‘80s?? Easy to agree with Sir Roger Scruton and make some Edwardian homes for 5 million people, and ending up with 50 Km diameter cities. Easy to say let’s keep building some hotch-potch classic style. Back then it was, at least to me, the natural direction to take. Same as what happen in painting and sculpture - the Abstract Expressionism, Roger Moore, etcetera… What you wanted to do back then!! Unfortunately, one of the problem of such kind of architecture is that natural elements are not going to be nice on it. Exposed concrete will deteriorate and looking ugly, maybe very ugly. You need to maintain it properly. What you may have saved in construction costs…will come back on your shoulder as maintenance costs. Also, not all building were designed nicely and some ended up in being a bit of a monsters in the middle of nowhere with horrible maintenance costs. For sure many started saying - What to like about this? Me, well, call me a weirdo but I always liked it. I had an epiphany the first time I went to London. The Barbican, The Hayward Gallery which luckily wasn’t closed - where I had the luck to personally meet Sir Anish Kapoor (!!!) in his first retrospective in London, The finally refurbished Trellick Tower (!!!) , and so on….

It is developed by the Greeks them selves. The Greeks had 30 different alphabets some of them were only writing system. !!! In Greece is found written texts 20.000 years old and alphabetical scripts back 7.500 old at least. Now about the Coptic, The Coptic script is based on the Greek alphabet(one of the Greek alphabets) The letters that are used to develop the Coptic Alphabet are Kapital as the small ones also.

Avocados oxidize and brown guacamole is really unappetizing. An hour or two helps the flavors meld together as well. If you make the guac ahead of time, press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the guacamole, don’t just wrap it loosely or cover it with a lid. You want as little air between the wrap and the guacamole as possible, to inhibit browning. Lime juice also helps to prevent browning, so give it a good shot, but not so much that it dominates the other flavors."},{"instruction":"What is the best meal for kittens to make them gain weight?","output":"Good brand of high calorie kitten food.

He or she see hundreds, perhaps thousands, of company ideas every year. He or she constantly has people introduced to him by associates or colleagues that they should meet with or talk with. He or she is constantly viewed as “Mr. Money Bags,” whose pockets are overflowing with money that they don’t know what to do with, or are holding on to it just waiting to throw it a the super duper fantastic company you started. (“If I can just get a couple of minutes in front of a guy who really understands the importance of my work, he will be so excited by the project the money will flow.” Seriously, that’s how a lot of entrepreneurs think.) That’s just for starters! And the sad fact is that the vast majority of companies a VC sees or founders he meets are not ready for investment. Actually, most are pretty bad. So no — It. Doesn’t. Work. That. Way. And if you think it does, you have no business being in this business. Any investor, be he a VC or an angel investor or something else, is on guard against founders who think if they can charm their way into getting funded. I won’t bother explaining the ways you get meet a VC, as that has been thoroughly explained many times here on Quora. To answer your question: You certainly may go up to a person, ask politely if they are indeed the person you think they are, and if they are, ask what is the process by which a company seeking funding should reach them. If he or she hands you a business card, or tells you go to their website, or whatever, that’s what you do. Do NOT insists on telling them about your product because they really do NOT care.

It’s worth investigating, although ultimately the answer will still be “no”, sadly. Firstly, it’s been done. Kind of. By evolution. Not to us of course (we’d have noticed, surely?), but to other - much smaller - animals. And it suits their lifestyles. (This may not be a lifestyle that suits us, of course!) * Consider the ‘solar-powered’ sacoglossan molluscs [ https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12983-016-0186-5 ], or green sea slugs, animals that “live like plants” using a type of photosynthetic organelle called - drum roll please - a chloroplast [ https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/chloroplast.htm ] * Check out Elysia chlorotica [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysia_chlorotica ] for example, which acquires these useful green-tinged plastids during feeding on its algal prey. Which is say they ‘steal’ the green bits for their own use [1] * These useful and otherwise self-contained chloroplasts are then hosted in intracellular cells lining the digestive tract of the sea slug. They provide sufficient energy (and carbon) for the short-ish lifespan of the slug. Above are some animals that have already beaten us to the idea. [2] Now this ‘theft by digestion’ trip may sound good for us in some ways, but we’d have to adapt ourselves in many other ways in order to ‘make it work’. For instance we’d have to make ourselves very flat, or very transparent. Or move our digestive system closer to our skin. This is sounding a bit too radical, I know. If we could do so, however, then perhaps it may be used - with supplemental nutrient enrichment - during induced human hibernation on long interstellar space journeys, for example. Just add sun lamps. But all of that aside, as asked the question must be answered in the negative. Let me unpick that a little. Can we insert or implant chlorophyll [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll ]? Sure. It may even look cool, and perhaps have some medicinal properties. I can see it taking off at some point in our future, especially if the marketing is good. * But chloroplasts [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast ] would arguably be more useful, as they are an endosymbiont [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont ] like our mitochondria, with their own package of DNA [3] [4] * Assuming we could get them to take hold and usefully integrate with our metabolism, of course, which doesn’t sound easy for big, long-lived and hyperactive animals like us * And then expose them to sunlight. Which is harder than it sounds for a macro-sized vertebrate. And even so they won’t replace what we already have, which has evolved with us to do exactly what we need. At best it would be a low-output supplementary system, or maybe just a cool green glow for display purposes only. Why so? * Well if we compare plants (and algae) with animals, it’s fairly obvious that animals - and especially terrestrial animals - need far more energy in order t..."},{"instruction":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer’s patient that they’re vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they’re in a care facility—assuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","output":"Not only is it unethical it is disrespectful.

It can be a coffee shop, a bar, or a park. It shows that you're thoughtful and considerate.Meet there: Don't accept a ride from a stranger or even an Uber. It's safer to meet your date at the agreed-upon location. If the date goes badly, you'll be glad they don't know where you live.Pay for yourself: It's okay to offer to pay for your own drink or meal on the first date. It shows that you're independent and not just there for a free meal. Plus, it's 2023, and we should strive for equal treatment and mutual respect.Avoid marathon dates: A long first date may seem romantic, but it can be exhausting and put unnecessary pressure on both of you. Keep the first date short and sweet, and leave room for a potential second date.Remember, you're not for everyone: It's important to be yourself on the first date and not try to appeal to everyone. The goal is to find someone you're compatible with, not to impress everyone you meet. Be authentic and honest about who you are and what you're looking for. Hope this helps."},{"instruction":"the term illegal immigrant meant to apply to the person or the offense, similar to calling a convict a murderer?","output":"An illegal immigrant, or illegal alien, is someone who has broken the law.

I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","output":"There's one thing everyone needs to know before everything: everyone can dance well !! The only thing that counts is effort. Well, you may think I sound like your teachers, but it IS true! EVEN WHEN IT'S HARD, NEVER GIVE UP ON WHAT YOU WANT! The good way to start dancing is to start with planning a dancing schedule; You need to have two times a week at least a dancing class, (You can look up places that are good and close to your home). If you can't afford it you can also look at dancing in YouTube; you can try and copy the moves, (It's better if you're doing it in front of a mirror, to check yourself).One of the most important things to dance in high quality is to be flexible. Believe me it makes a big difference. If you're already flexible you would probably have to continue practicing stretching once a week. If you're not flexible, don't worry, if you look up ways to stretch and stretch at least four times a week you would probably catch up.There's always a basic you need to learn before the hard. In our case, the basic you need to learn and practice is ballet. Even if you aren't learning ballet and learning for example hip hop you would need the help of the basic ballet, to be a very good dancer.The more the merrier; If you try all sorts of types of dancing your body would get used to all kinds and you would be a serious dancer. It's good to try more than just one type of dance because then your body knows how to move differently. I hope now, that you know what you should do, start dancing! (And don't forget to enjoy every moment! 😉)"},{"instruction":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","output":"“I’m very passionate about learning, I love working with a team, and I’ve always been in the top ten of my classes.”, I wrote. The problem was, there were only ten students in my class that semester. The bold letters of the application form scared me. “Tell us about your academic achievements, and how you demonstrate excellence in the classroom.” I had tried wording my response in a thousand different ways, but nothing sounded right. Applications like these, whether they were for clubs, leadership roles, or even universities, used to come easily to me. I was recognized as gifted in fourth grade, and I watched, usually from the sidelines, as my classmates - what our teachers called “like-minded peers” - took on piles after piles of essays and worksheets, and received stacks of boxes filled with trophies and certificates that they’d never look at again. First place, of course. Because getting second is as good as getting nothing at all. In our education system, mediocrity is unacceptable. There are so many kids out there, who, like me, would pride themselves on never ever ever getting a B. But underneath all of those hefty academic achievements, I think a lot of students are genuinely struggling. When you’re told from a young age that your standard is excellence, and that the only way to succeed, go to uni, and get a good job is to outshine others, people often start seeing in black and white.[LINKED_TEXT: ¹] [URL: https://medium.com/mindsets/gifted-kid-burnout-breaking-free-of-smartness-2c29e71a6cd0] Something is acceptable, or a complete failure. You’re either doing well in school, or you’re dumb. In my sophomore math class, nine out of ten students received marks above 91.² But even the highest scoring kids in that class still felt inadequate compared to each other, and faced tremendous stress in terms of their marks - because they’ve been conditioned by our school system to set themselves to impossible standards, and in turn, to base their self-worth on how well they can achieve them. It seems sad to me that the attempts by the school system in “promoting excellence” has turned into something so toxic. footnotes: [LINKED_TEXT: ¹] [URL: https://medium.com/mindsets/gifted-kid-burnout-breaking-free-of-smartness-2c29e71a6cd0] - the link to a really good medium article i read about the topic! the part that stood out to me the most is as follows: Research done by Professor Carol Dweck (author of Mindsets: The New Psychology of Success) shows that giving kids positive labels such as “gifted”, “talented”, or “smart” in their formative years pushes them into what she calls a “fixed mindset”: believing that qualities are “set in stone”, “fearing challenge and devaluing effort” — with a fixed mindset, people “[don’t] want to do anything that could expose their flaws and call into question their talent.” - H.

Sachin is called as “ God of Cricket” if someone asks when can Kohli become “God of Cricket” or why doesn't ViV Richards called as “God Of Cricket” then how absurd it would be. In future some prodigy like Sachin can emerge and he may outclass Sachin but then also will he called as the “God of Cricket”? Mammootty and Mohan LAL are world class actors. Though Mammootty is 10 years older than Mammootty but still both of them started their career in early 80’s. Mammootty got opportunities to act as a hero right from the beginning and Mohan Lal had that opportunity after proving himself by doing all kind of roles including villain roles. Later on both of them became superstars and the habit of giving titles started by the following the suit with Tamil Industry. Someone might have thought that it is not creative to call both of them the tag of “Super stars” so based on the age advantage they might have started to call him as “ Mega star”..I don't think there is some relevance for such titles. For instance, Shah rukh is called as “Badshah” of Bollywood whose some of the recent movies weren't accepted according to his stature where as his contemporaries like Salman, Akshay, Aamir Khan has surpassed him in terms of box office collections, even relatively new comers like Ranveer or Ayushman Khurrana for that matter, now who is the real Badshah? The “complete actor” is another title granted for Mohan Lal, if actors or fans of the actors are competing with such things then it will be never ending or at least till such words are fully exhausted from the dictionaries. Ajith Kumar, the Tamil actor was previously called as “ Ultimate star” along with his disbandment of fans association he threw that title also away. Now, his name is shown in the movie as it was given by his parents. I think both Mammootty and Mohan Lal likes to be called as “Mammookka” and “ Lalettan” the title of respect given by Malayalis as their elder brothers…"},{"instruction":"Why are Siberian Huskies abandoned in large quantities?","output":"I'm in the process of adopting a husky from a 501 animal rescue organization that is specific to huskies. There were over 20 adoptable dogs I'm looking through. It was pretty clear why they were surrendered by their owners after reading all their profiles. They chase and kill small animals, specifically cats. It could be your house cat or your neighbors cat or even a stray cat who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. They will only be sent to “cat free” homes and homes with no other small animals. They're great with kids. But birds, squirrels, cats, and possible other small dogs will be attacked. So if your neighbor has a cat, don't be shocked if something happens to it and your neighbor seeks damages in court, but only if the cat didn't wander into your property where the dog was that is. Huskies need lots of exercise as they are high energy working dogs. I'm looking into getting one because I live in a rural area surrounded by three state forests and springs. There's hiking trails everywhere and I plan to adopt a dog that is “outdoorsy” and won't get too cold when trail walking in the colder months. I saw the huskies online and so many of them need homes and appear to be a great fit for hiking trails alongside me and my family. They are beautiful dogs but they have needs. It's a responsibility and most people want a husky like they want a new handbag - something to show off - until it gets bigger, more demanding and chews all your handbags… that's when those not wanting the responsibility abandon them, because it's not “cute” anymore. The one I'm looking at is two years old and has been crate trained and housebroken by the 501c so I'll be putting in my application soon and hope I can take him home in the next 30 days or so"},{"instruction":"CNN reported that 1,000 US health experts have demanded that businesses not be allowed to reopen, but protestors should not be criticized for violating suggestions and increasing infection risks.

I have said a lot of these things but perhaps not all of them in one post. This time I will say it in a more direct way. You do not want to get this damn virus, you will damage your lungs, shorten your life, its like smoking 1000 cigarettes a day. You will not be able to breathe yourself but not because someone had a knee on your neck but because you have COVID-19. No one will come to your funeral, no one will visit you in the hospital except perhaps a guy dressed up like a space traveler.

You will be treated like you have the most dangerous disease in the world, because you do. Let’s say that it is not a very pleasant experience bodily fluid wise. There are many other unpleasant things that you will experience as well which I will leave to your immagination. Please keep this in mind. This is not a normal flu. Does it sound like a normal flu to you? I don’t think so. My really good friend just yesterday, described the stage of the virus in Italy as passed the blue bubble stage. In the USA you are not out of the blue bubble stage you are right in the middle of it. You may ask ok give, what is the blue bubble stage? Well that is the stage that if you come in contact with someone who is infected then the area around them or the blue bubble area, if you contract the virus from them, then this is when the strength of the disease or virus is the strongest. This is when people who come into contact with these people have a good chance of dying within 2 weeks. If you are not in tip top health then, well, you are are risking your life. Does this all sound like a normal yearly flu bug to you. NO NO NO , it is not. Get that stupid idea out of your head and put on some gloves and a mask if you go outside. If you are around other people please, pretty please put on some gloves and a mask. Wash your hands and face every time you go out. When you buy your food at the supermarket, leave the food in the garage for a few days if possible, and let the food disinfect. Wash the plastic around the food or take it off. Using gloves of course! Do you really think that almost the entire world shut down just for fun? Please, if you have not taken the virus serious for whatever reason please do so now. For those who want to always talk about politics , there is no right and left here talking, there is only perhaps death and the distruction of your body and you pee peeing into a plastic bag for the rest of your life because you refused to listen to Scientists.

One that stands out was a guy who asked for his burger without onions, then claimed that he was deathly allergic to onions in any form. However, he did want the ketchup. I had recently learned from another customer that, because ketchup has onion powder in it, a customer who is deathly allergic to onions can’t have ketchup either. In taking this guy’s order, I clarified that he still wanted the ketchup, mustard, and pickles—because I was very good at my job. He did. When he said he was deathly allergic to onions, I calmly replied that he should also get it without ketchup because ketchup has onion powder in it. Not too surprisingly, he admitted that he’s not allergic and he was only saying that because he wanted to make sure it wouldn’t have onions on it, because he did not want them, not because of any kind of illness. His friends had a long laugh at his expense. As I always did, I passed along his order to the kitchen—as requested, but without the false allergy claim. I had long since drilled into relevant coworkers the importance of making sandwiches as ordered. My oldest brother really did have a sensitivity to raw onions.

Here are some mind-blowing facts that may sound unreal but are actually true: 1. Cleopatra lived closer to the moon landing than to the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Cleopatra lived around 30 BCE, while the Great Pyramid was built around 2560 BCE, making the time difference between Cleopatra and the moon landing (1969 CE) much smaller. 2. Oxford University is older than the Aztec Empire. The University of Oxford was established in the 12th century, while the Aztec Empire emerged in the 14th century. 3. There are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Estimates suggest that there are around 3 trillion trees on Earth, whereas the Milky Way is estimated to have 100 to 400 billion stars. 4. The Tyrannosaurus rex lived closer in time to humans than it did to the Stegosaurus. The Tyrannosaurus rex lived approximately 68-66 million years ago, while the Stegosaurus lived around 150 million years ago. 5. Humans share about 50% of their DNA with bananas. Although this fact may sound strange, DNA sequencing has revealed that humans share many genetic similarities with other organisms, including bananas. 6. There are more possible iterations of a game of chess than there are atoms in the observable universe. The number of possible moves in a game of chess is estimated to be around 10^120, while the number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated to be around 10^80. 7. Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible due to its low moisture and acidic pH. 8. Mount Everest is not the tallest mountain in the world. While Mount Everest is the highest peak above sea level, when measured from base to summit, Mauna Kea in Hawaii holds the title. Most of Mauna Kea's height is submerged underwater, making Everest the more recognized \\"tallest\\" mountain. 9. The time difference between the stegosaurus and the tyrannosaurus is greater than the time difference between the tyrannosaurus and now. 10.

Actually it does not work that way at all. Languages do not get created out of vacuum. They evolve over time. They evolve as the culture evolves. No languages was ever created with complete and complex language structure. They are definitely not “given” or “invented” by sages and gives to the masses. On the contrary, it is the masses that “develop” a language. Anyone suddenly “gifting” a language with complete grammar and works is plain ridiculous. Actually there are numerous examples of a language being created by a SINGLE person with complete syntax and stuff. C is one, Java is another :) In other words, programming languages. We all know not everyone can learn them. So no language has a single origin. Tamil is no exception. So if we date Tholkappiyam to 300 BCE, Tamil would have existed before then at least for 5 centuries or more. You cannot simply develop a grammar out of vacuum. Non-formal language must have existed before grammar got codified. Ancient Tamil literature does not have any information pointing out to Tamil’s origins. It cannot have any such reference because it is impossible to pinpoint the origin of any particular language to a specific time period.

Many of us delay the car buying decision just because of the financial burden. Going for a car loan is a viable option for those who don’t want to invest a huge chunk of money at once. It gives you the flexibility to own a car on easy EMI without putting a strain on your pocket. Last year, I got a Maruti Suzuki Swift on finance, and it has been the best decision ever. I paid a minimum down payment amount, and the rest of the payment is spread out in easy monthly instalments by Maruti Suzuki Smart Finance.

The best part about financing my car from Maruti Suzuki Smart [LINKED_TEXT: Swift Finance] [URL: https://www.marutisuzuki.com/more-from-us/finance] is that they have multiple financiers, so I had the flexibility to choose the best deal for my car loan.

Well, due to her trauma with the other cat she would eat and drink water way too fast and vomit ALL over my uncles room. He was getting pissed. Eventually she decided she didn’t want to associate with him or my brother anymore so she went on an adventure and noticed my door was opened, she walked right in and jumped on my bed. At first, My uncle told me to keep my door shut and to give him his cat back, but one day she ate a bit too much and vomited all over his bed and pillows, he was pissed and when he noticed she wasn’t in his room and wasn’t anywhere else in the house, he asked me if I had her. I said, “Yeah, she slept with me last night.” He just looked at me, told me to keep her and my Grandmama bought me a litter box for her and I bought her some bowls. Her name came from Cinderellas step mothers cat, she literally acts just like him lmao, she’s the queen of my room and I’ve had her for 2 years, she’s 4. She has sense gotten her sister(1) and didn’t like her at first but now simply tolerates her and sometimes I catch them cuddling and kissing eachother. Sometimes, it’s from abuse, other times it’s because they know they’re needed elsewhere or simply, they’re sick of their owner. Lucifer was just sick of my Uncle. I will say though, at that time of my life I was particularly suicidal and I think she senses that and decided to make sure I didn’t do anything stupid. The minutes she sees me acting suspicious or sees a knife or razor in my hand, even if I’m just being a dumbass and carving something, she makes sure to lay on my arm so I can’t even think about touching it without moving her, she knows my one weakness and sure does use it to my advantage. I never mess with her if she’s comfortable or sleeping, and she knows that. Lucifers sister, Lucky, doesn’t have the much of a story, I got her as a kitten and she’s the Queen in training, some days she is the queen. They share the crown and throne together, I’m just simply the slave who feeds, waters and plays with them and pets or cuddles them whenever they want.

A loan shark is a person who offers loans at a high-interest rate. Rich landlords can be loan sharks. It is a crime. They don’t have the right to take legal action against the debt payer. In short, one should not go to a loan shark to get loans. They can be dangerous. To offer a loan in any state, one must follow the strict rules of the government. Next, he has to pay taxes per year to the government. On the contrary, a loan shark does not follow the rules and offers loans to targeted individuals. The help seekers step into the trap of the shark and lose everything to pay the debt. Next, a loan shark can be a dangerous person to the debt payer. They offer loans with extreme conditions that may become impossible to follow. However, the number of loan sharks is increasing day by day. Almost every country has included loan sharking as an illegal practice. Moreover, it creates a barrier to the national economy. It not only forces the debt payer but also suffers the entire family.

Provided you can aford to pay the rent on your own, it makes no difference. It does make him liable for the rent if you don’t pay.

While there are some risks involved, it is a legal and legitimate way to potentially increase your wealth. However, before diving headfirst into the world of cryptocurrencies, it's important to understand the ins and outs of this digital asset class. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, have gained significant popularity in recent years. They offer unique advantages over traditional forms of currency and have the potential for substantial returns on investment. Here are a few key points to consider when deciding if investing in cryptocurrencies is worth it for you: 1. Potential for High Returns: One of the main reasons people invest in cryptocurrencies is the potential for high returns. Bitcoin, for example, has experienced tremendous growth since its inception, with some early investors seeing substantial gains. However, it's important to note that the cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically in a short period. As with any investment, it's crucial to do your research and only invest what you can afford to lose. 2. Diversification: Cryptocurrencies offer an opportunity to diversify your investment portfolio. By adding digital assets to your holdings, you can reduce the risk associated with relying solely on traditional investments like stocks or bonds. Cryptocurrencies have a low correlation with other asset classes, meaning they may perform differently during market downturns or economic crises. 3. Accessibility: Investing in cryptocurrencies is relatively easy and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. There are numerous platforms and exchanges where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies, making it convenient for both beginners and experienced investors. However, it's important to choose reputable platforms that prioritize security and have a track record of protecting investors' funds. 4. Technological Innovation: Cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology, which is considered to be one of the most significant technological advancements in recent years. The blockchain provides a decentralized and transparent way to record transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. 5. Long-Term Potential: While cryptocurrencies have had their fair share of ups and downs, many experts believe they have long-term potential. Some proponents argue that cryptocurrencies could eventually replace traditional forms of currency, offering a more efficient and secure way to conduct financial transactions. However, it's important to approach this with caution and not get caught up in the hype. The market is still relatively young and evolving, so it's essential to stay informed and adapt your investment strategy accordingly. In conclusion, investing in cryptocurrencies can be a worthwhile endeavor for those willing to do their due diligence and understand the risks involved. It's essential to approach it with a long-term perspective, diversify your portfolio, and only invest what you can afford to lose. As with any investment, it's crucial to stay informed, keep up with market trends, and seek advice from reputable sources.

What should I do?","output":"This is a difficult situation, especially since your partner and your therapy dog have both been important parts of your life for different lengths of time. There is no single, easy answer to this situation, as there are many factors to consider. The first thing to do is to assess why your partner doesn’t like your therapy dog. If your partner’s dislike is based on a legitimate concern, such as allergies or a fear of dogs, then it is important to consider their feelings and how to address them. It is important to try to find a compromise that both of you can be comfortable with. For example, you might consider asking your partner to stay in a different room when you are with your therapy dog, or taking extra precautions to keep the dog away from your partner. On the other hand, if your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is simply because they don’t like animals, then it is important to talk to them about why they don’t like animals and to understand their perspective. In this case, it is important to remember that your relationship is still in its early stages and that you should try to be understanding of your partner’s feelings. No matter the reason for your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog, it is important to have an honest conversation about the issue. Talk to them about why they don’t like your therapy dog and how you feel about it. This conversation should focus on understanding each other’s perspectives and finding a way to move forward that is comfortable for both of you. It is also important to remember that your therapy dog has been a part of your life for 10 years and that you have a special bond with the dog. The dog has been a source of comfort, companionship, and support for you, and it is important to remember these benefits when discussing the issue with your partner. Finally, it is important to consider the future of your relationship. If your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is something that you are unable to resolve, then it is important to consider if this is something that you can continue to accept in the long-term. If not, then it might be best to seek a different relationship in which both you and your partner feel comfortable and respected. In summary, it is important to assess why your partner doesn’t like your therapy dog, to have an honest conversation about the issue, and to remember the benefits that your therapy dog has brought to your life. It is also important to consider the future of your relationship and to seek a different relationship if needed. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

It was a skin grafting and burn debridement on a 100 Kg 18 year old. Of course we had pediatric tubing and a pediatric blood warmer and I was having a hard time keeping up with the fluid requirements for a patient 10 times the size the equipment was designed for. I put a pressure bag on the blood bag I was using to transfuse this heavily bleeding patient and the pressure caused the insert in the waist high blood warmer to rupture, blasting most of a unit into my abdomen.

Let me give you a personal example of how leasing turned out to be very good for me. A few years ago, I leased a particular car model, which I won’t mention, but it was a well respected luxury brand. The 3-year lease began just fine and I thoroughly enjoyed the car, thinking it was probably the best car I had ever driven. However, about half-way though the lease, things began happening — nearly everything electrical in the car failed at different times, such that the car spent a lot of time in the dealer’s service shop. There were also more problems in other areas. All were covered under warranty. As it turns out, that particular model for that particular year was a major redesign and its propensity for problems became well known. But the worst part was yet to come. In the final year of my lease several owners across the country experienced unexplained run-away acceleration problems, even when the vehicle was in Park. A few of the accidents caused injuries and property damage, which got the attention of national news, as did the subsequent investigations. Let me point out that I never experienced the run-away problem with my particular car. As a result of all the issues and publicity, resale values for this specific car model dropped like a rock. Owners found that they had lost nearly all equity value and it created instant “upside down” situations for those who were buying with a loan. For me, however, no problem — because I was leasing. At the end of the lease I simply returned the car as planned, gladly letting the lease company take the huge financial loss created by all the problems and bad publicity. They probably just junked the car because it had little or no resale value left. I had to give myself a pat on the back for being so smart — in hindsight — by leasing. The moral of this story is that leasing protects you from unexpected loss of a vehicle’s value during the lease. Although my personal story here was actually more about good luck than being smart, leasing can be beneficial to those who take an informed approach to it — knowing how it works, knowing how to determine if leasing is the right choice, and knowing how to determine a good deal. That’s precisely why I created [LINKED_TEXT: LeaseGuide.com] [URL: http://leaseguide.com/] as a (mostly) free resource for folks who want to be smart about car leasing.

Where do these myths come from? Every kid, if they're not living in a country where food is scarce, will develop individual eating habits. Let me give you my personal experience with MY own kids: eldest daughter is a brocoli fan, she would do whatever it takes to eat sushi, and she likes to munch on raw algae (nori in particular) whenever possible, even at breakfast. But, she hates meat in general, even though she likes processed stuff: sausage, chorizo, whatever... go figure. We're always fighting with her so she finishes her plate. She used to love raw oysters and seafood in general, but now she hates it. She loves dairy products.youngest daughter would eat ANYthing with meat in it. Any kind of meat: steak of course, but also veal liver, beef tongue, whatever. Oh and she LOVES sausage, ham and other processed meats. She also loves chick peas and spinach (go figure)... We're always fighting with her so she eats a little less meat. Loves chocolate cake, but not chocolate... She eats red beans with banana in the morning (on account of my eating beans and lentils almost every morning). She loves shrimp and crab, but not oysters. She positively hates dairy products so much we never tell her what that mouth-watering grâtin is. And, of course, their respective habits are subject to change every once in a while. They suddenly go \\"oh I don't like this anymore\\"... All I want to say is we raised them the same, or at least we tried to. I cook from scratch every day, we buy fresh food every week, we try to teach them to prepare and cook stuff from scratch. And in the end, they couldn't be any more different in their eating habits.

Don’t trade in the midst of a volatile market. That is the cardinal rule. Intraday trading is best done when the direction and momentum of the market is predictable. Otherwise, you could end up spending more time triggering stop losses. 2. Intraday trading is all about protecting capital. First, focus on how much loss you are willing to take overall and on a per-trade basis. Once you can protect your capital from depleting beyond a point, intraday profits will automatically follow. 3. Never trade intraday without a stop loss. Remember, stop losses are required in most trades but in intraday trading, it is an absolute must. In the absence of stop losses, you may end up holding positions with unmanageable MTM losses. 4. Always decide your profit target based on our risk-return trade-off. Stop-loss is one side of the story; the other side is you also need to take profits. Let your profit targets be a multiple of your stop loss. A trade-off of 3:1 or 2:1 is understandable, not 1:1. 5. Don’t stretch yourself on the margin of trading. When you leverage yourself on margins keep an eye on your worst-case loss. Don’t stretch yourself to a point that your losses become unaffordable in the event of any black swan occurrences. 6. Avoid the lure of tips and only trade when you are convinced. There is no shortage of research analysts and market experts. Most of them are just pretenders to the throne. Treat these ideas with a pinch of salt. There is no alternative to doing your own research before trading intraday. That works best at all times! 7. Staying away from markets is also an important decision for intraday traders. As an intraday trader, there are 3 key decisions you make; when to buy, when to sell and when to sit tight. Interestingly, most of the money in intraday trading is actually made when you sit out doing nothing while the rest of the market is burning profits in the chaos. 8. Record your wins and your losses and evaluate them at the end of the day. This may sound pedestrian and clerical but extremely important. Keep a tab of trades that went wrong and those that went right. Keep a scrap book to analyze what you did wrong and what you could have done better. It will really help you in becoming a better trader. 9. Averaging your trades is the cardinal sin in intraday trading. It is quite common to buy more of a stock when it corrects. Averaging is wrong for two reasons. Firstly, you are running the risk of being wrong twice. Secondly, you might increase your exposure to a particular stock more than warranted. That could also put your capital at greater risk. 10. Keep a tab on the news; otherwise you are likely to fail as an intraday trader. Intraday trading is not about punting in the markets; it is a lot more organized. Keep a tab on news and on macros. Evaluate the flow of corporate actions and results announcements. All these are useful inputs if you want to be an informed intraday trader. 11. Know the companies you are trading, their business, technical levels etc. That is not only for fundamental analysts. Even intraday traders need to have a hang of what the company is doing and how it is performing. 12. Learn to catch momentum and learn to evaluate F&O data. Intraday trading is all about being on the right side of momentum. F&O data points like open interest, option strike accumulation, IVs; Put Call Ratios are all important indicators for intraday trading. 13. Never panic when you are trading intraday. When you panic you subsidize the other trader who does not panic. Also, panic forces you to take hasty and wrong decisions in the market which you are forced to regret at leisure. 14. Don’t rue over losses, they are part and parcel of intraday trading. It is good to look back and analyze why you made losses. But don’t lose sleep over the losses you made on a day. These are part and parcel of your trading activity. Take it in your stride. 15. If you are an intraday trader, beware of the overnight risk. If you are an intraday trader, stick to your knitting. Carrying positions overnight runs the overnight risk and your intraday trader capital may not be equipped to take that kind of risk. Be cautious. 16. There is nothing like a free lunch in intraday trading. Don’t get carried because you earned handsome profits on a single day. Markets have the dirty capacity to hit you when you least expect it. Return is a function of risk and there is nothing like easy money. 17. If something is too good to be true then it is probably not true. This is especially true if your position has yielded attractive profits within an hour. Don’t try to run your luck for long. If something is too good to be true, just take your profits and walk out. 18. Don’t waste your time with stock highs and lows; they don’t matter. Whether you are an intraday trader or an investor; nobody has consistently caught market tops and bottoms. It is not only impossible but also meaningless. The incremental benefit is limited so don’t obsess with buying at the bottom and selling at the top. 19. Never try to recover your losses through over-trading. This is a golden rule of intraday trading. Quite often if you buy and the stop loss gets triggered, the tendency is short double the position. This overtrading will lead you to lose money both ways. 20. There is no golden rule and only practice makes you a good intraday trader. Finally, the golden rule of intraday trading is that there is no golden rule. It is essentially an activity that calls for discipline and risk management and will only be perfected over time. As Euclid wrote, “There is no royal road to Geometry”. That applies to intraday trading as well."},{"instruction":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","output":"There are countless beautiful places in the world, each with its own unique charm and appeal.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create your own WordPress website: 1. Choose a domain name and hosting provider: Before you can start building your WordPress website, you need to choose a domain name and a hosting provider. The domain name is the address that people will use to access your website, and the hosting provider is where your website's files will be stored. 2.

Most hosting providers offer a one-click install option for WordPress, which makes the process quick and easy. 3. Choose a theme: WordPress has thousands of free and premium themes to choose from. A theme is a pre-designed template that determines the look and layout of your website. Choose a theme that aligns with your brand and has the functionality you need. 4. Customize your theme: Once you've chosen a theme, you can customize it to fit your needs. You can customize the colors, fonts, and layout of your website using the built-in WordPress customizer. 5. Create pages and posts: With your theme customized, you can start creating pages and posts for your website. Pages are static content, like your homepage and about page, while posts are dynamic content, like blog posts. 6. Install necessary plugins: You can research and install the necessary plugins that will help improve your website's functionality. 7. Optimize your website for SEO: Search engine optimization (SEO) is important for getting your website ranked on search engines like Google. Use SEO best practices like optimizing your meta titles and descriptions, using keywords, and adding alt tags to your images. 8. Test and launch your website: Before launching your website, be sure to test it thoroughly. Check for broken links, test your forms, and make sure everything is working properly.

I can’t imagine a health care system that works that way and, in fact, it didn’t in the US when I had to visit health care there. You have to make an appointment (usually), get there early, fill in forms, produce ID (your health card in Canada, showing you’re entitled), usually answer questions from the receptionist or nurse, wait in the waiting room for a while (with sick people), get called in, take stuff out of your pockets to get weighed and height measured, put stuff back in your pockets, go to a chilly exam room, strip, sit around in a backless gown for a while… then see the doctor. These days it usually doesn’t end there: usually they question you briefly, write up blood tests they need to see before further discussion (after another appointment for the test, waiting, sticking with needle), then another appointment, etc., etc., with doctor.

Personally, I try to be a good Christian, I’m an Elder in my church, pray at least twice a day, including for people I don’t even like or respect (such as some political types). I’ve even been to the the Ark Encounter in Kentucky (which is REALLY amazing). All that being said I really don’t believe there was literally a flood that covered the whole world. Some of the stories in the Old Testament are based on stories that were passed by word of mouth though many generations before being written down. I don’t doubt there was a historical basis for it, perhaps it was when the natural dam between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea failed. But in the end it doesn’t matter. Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God. Some of us take it literally word for word, others, like myself, understand that when pen was put to paper (or parchment or whatever) it was fallible human beings like ourselves that did the actual writing. We also know that the Bible is the work of many men (and a few women), over millennia, they all can’t be the literal word of God, but they all can be, and are, inspired by Him. You want to really give your wife a treat, stop trying to convince her, accept her as she is, and then take her to Kentucky to see the Ark Encounter, it really is amazing, and they do an excellent job of explaining how it could have worked. But don’t do it on a Saturday morning (it’s mobbed), and… even if the Ark was real I don’t think there were dinosaurs on it!"},{"instruction":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","output":"Yes of course. [LINKED_TEXT: Car leasing] [URL: https://www.jmdleasing.com/] can benefit you in many ways. You have lower monthly payments than if you were purchasing a car. If you think that you should have every new model with you then this is the way where you can lease a vehicle every 2 to 3 years. Only thing you should do is just maintain a car in first 3 years of owning a car which means you don’t have to deal with major car repairs. This will end up in a lower monthly payment, but you will constantly have a monthly payment.

I opted for Physics as my minor, because while preparing for JEE, Physics was my favourite subject but I couldn't dare to opt it as my major as my JEE AIR was too high. I would have felt out of place in that class. Even now as I attend some classes in the Physics department for my credit requirement I feel I am way ahead of everyone else. Professors treat me differently, I observe. Studying for two degrees basically means I have no time whatsoever, not even for shitting. I have no social life. Everyday of my college life goes like this: I wake up at 8.45 in the morning, just 15 mins before class. I shit and brush at the same time. Put on my shorts and tees, grab couple of bread and jam slices from mess and chase an overcrowded bus in front of H7 moving towards lecture complex. I mostly sit at the back in the lecture hall, either nap or work on some project/assignment/puzzle that interests me. I find lectures boring, more so 'cos I know most of the stuff usually. I read a lot on the topics that interest me. Other subjects I just try to maintain minimum attendance and passing requirements. I skip lunch, maybe grab some Maggie and ice tea from canteen and head towards library. I am collaborating with a grad student from MIT for a research project, who is my friend. For now I work that as much as possible. There aren't many cutting edge research undertaking in IITs, research here lags way behind comapared to top places in the world. A different topic altogether friends, but IITs are more like Technical Management Institutes rather than Technical Research Institutes. Anyways, back to my story. After lunch break, again suffer through the torture of NPTEL-style Indian Professor’s lectures. And like before, I am seated at the back. Occasionally a Prof is distracted by my “absence”, he throws a question at me. I answer lazily without even trying and after few gazes from the “mugga” junta (by heart learners), status quo is re- established. After college hours is the best time on campus. For me it's time to hang out with my buddies, my peer group, who all like me aspire to move to US for higher studies. We mainly discuss about different schools, campus culture, scholarship programs, majors etc. Occasionally we got out to grab a bite. Sometimes, some JJ medical guys, who are friends with one of our buddies, join us. They have some cute girls in their group. But they are completely lost when we go off on some fancy topics like Quantum Physics or Cosmology or even medicine related technology. But they seem impressed, because when I get some lone time with any one or two of them, things are passionately expressed to say the least. Between college semesters is way more busy than regular college schedule. I either take up a research project collaborating with some friend/Prof in US or take up internship (as I did last sem break). Cheers! And by the way, one of the girls from JJ whom I quite like looks like this She is from Assam. She's totally into me.

Jefferson loved France and seemed to prefer the French people over the British whereas Adams hated the French and saw them as violent agitators looking to go to war with the U.S. Now, it’s not necessarily the like or dislike itself that would have changed the Louisiana Purchase, it was the mindset of the two. Jefferson, as he stayed connected with people in France, recognized not only that the U.S. was not going to be a target for Bonaparte but that France was hemorrhaging money due to their wars, so he was able to parlay that information into a “steal of a deal” with France’s Bonaparte. Adams hated France, had no legitimate connections in France and was sometimes prone to cut off his own nose to spite his face so I gotta’ believe - had Adams won - there may have been conflict in the Louisiana area in an effort to extract the French from our border. I’m not well-versed on military strategy, so I’m not sure how well armed conflict would have gone for the U.S., but history’s trajectory definitely would have been different."},{"instruction":"What is the color code for 52M ohm?","output":"The first color here gives a 5 (green), the second is a 2 (red), and the third (black) gives the number of zeros after that.

Expertise is gained by running many cases and checking the quality of those cases religiously. Gain experience quickly, set cases up carefully and then scrutinize the results even more carefully. As you set up the case, make mental notes on the choices you make and such as grid clustering and turbulence models. Run several cases varying these choices and look at the effect on the flow solution. Ask others how they make these choices. Run validation cases regularly and prove to yourself that you are making good choices. Run numerical tests varying aspects of the case set up and compare them to the validation cases. Learn what becomes a big mistake and what has little or no effect. Compare flow solvers. Some require more grid in the boundary layer. Some are less robust to skewed cells. Some add too much artificial dissipation. Run grid resolution studies on predominant flow features such as jets and recirculation regions. Look at how the flow solution changes with additional grid. Learn many tools and know what each does well and what each does badly. Don't ever hesitate to try a new tool or re-evaluate an older tool (that's been improved by the developer). Talk to the developers. Find out what they think is important and why they made the choices they did. Learn what's in the solver. While you don't need to know how to program a solver from scratch, have some idea what the different choices actually mean from a solver point of view. Network with other CFD people and developers and find out what others know. Develop long term relationships in the CFD community so you know who to ask for help when you need it. There is a lot of knowledge that doesn't get written down in conference papers and books. The best applied CFDers are often the quiet people who are not out spoken. Find them and talk to them. Finally, CFD is hard to get right because there are so many details. Take care with the details. Take care that the case is converged and that the grid was good. Be willing to rerun a case again and again until you have the details right. Do these things for about 5 years and you'll be a CFD expert."},{"instruction":"w is a BSc in geology from AMU?","output":"The department of geology of amu is one of the best and famous department from others in faculty of science….there are very good faculties, laboratory, infrastructure, smart classroom,etc…..if u want to graduate in GEOLOGY..then amu is the best.."},{"instruction":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","output":"I would throw my drink at him"},{"instruction":"What is the best Indian live chat apps?","output":"For people who are finding a best solution to integrate live chat to your website, you should check this information:"},{"instruction":"What is the most foul smelling thing you found when cleaning out a room or closet in your house or garage?","output":"Nothing in particular. The only really foul thing I came across, was one weekend while working. We had run a large armoured cable for a new machine, and were going to connect it into the large circuit breaker in an on site substation. Now as it was too close to home time on the Saturday, we left the back plates off the circuit breakers with the busbars now exposed. Now we thought that 8t would be perfectly safe, as we locked the doors to the substation, washed off and went home. Sunday morning, we went to carry on and do the connections, and the stench that hit us as we opened the substation door, well, we all came close to losing our breakfast. Unfortunately, there was a slight gap under the door, and a cat had got in. Unfortunately the moggy got itself across the live busbars, 415v and they were fed from another main breaker, with a very high current capacity. Over 1000 amps. We had to clean the fried moggy up once obviously making sure that the busbars were now dead. Not really something that I'd like to do again. Now I've never been a cat lover, but no, it was not nice, to say the least."},{"instruction":"Why do some dipole antennas use Balun but others do not?","output":"Mostly because some people at times feel it is needed, even if the impedance is matched (and they are correct) and some people feel that in some circumstances they are not needed.

While there are many treatments available, including pain medication and physical therapy, some people prefer to try alternative methods to alleviate their pain. One such method that has gained popularity in recent years is Hyperbolic Stretching. Hyperbolic Stretching is a program that uses a unique combination of stretching exercises and techniques to improve flexibility, increase strength, and reduce pain. The program has been designed by Alex Larsson, a renowned fitness coach and nutritionist who has been helping people achieve their fitness goals for over a decade. The program has proven to be effective in reducing back pain for many people. One reason for this is that Hyperbolic Stretching focuses on stretching exercises that target the muscles and joints in the back. These exercises work to stretch and lengthen the muscles, which can help to reduce tension and alleviate pain. Additionally, Hyperbolic Stretching can help to improve posture, which is a common cause of back pain. Poor posture can cause muscles to become imbalanced, leading to pain and discomfort. By improving posture through stretching exercises, Hyperbolic Stretching can help to correct these imbalances and reduce pain. Another benefit of Hyperbolic Stretching is that it is a low-impact exercise program. Many other exercise programs, such as weightlifting or running, can be hard on the back and exacerbate pain. However, Hyperbolic Stretching focuses on gentle stretching exercises that do not put undue stress on the back. The program also includes a warm-up routine that is designed to prepare the body for stretching exercises. This is important because stretching cold muscles can lead to injury and increased pain. The warm-up routine helps to increase blood flow to the muscles, making them more pliable and reducing the risk of injury. In conclusion, Hyperbolic Stretching is an effective and safe method for reducing back pain. By using stretching exercises and techniques, the program can help to improve flexibility, increase strength, and reduce tension in the muscles and joints of the back. Additionally, the program is low-impact and includes a warm-up routine, which helps to prevent injury and further pain. If you suffer from back pain and are looking for a natural and effective way to alleviate your symptoms, Hyperbolic Stretching may be worth trying.

The way ITV operate at the moment is closer to how the tabloids work than the BBC. Namely, they aren’t satisfied with just waiting for something to happen and reporting it. No, they go a step further and create news. The problem is trying to make something newsworthy without it seeming too formulaic. People love a negative story because of how it naturally activates their brain to seek solutions, so negative news makes lots of money. So, if you can create chaos and scandal and are in a position to deliver that as content, you can make a lot of money and advertising revenue from it. Think of it as being like WWF wrestling. People know it’s fake but they still love the entertainment. This is also why some tabloids go so far as to report fictional TV soap stories as if they’re real. If they can break the cycle between story and reality, then imagination is the limit. So, Piers Morgan is using his own manufactured friction between himself and Meghan Markle to create drama and then manipulating that drama to create fake news. It’s fake because he’s creating news solely for the purpose of profiting from it. Think that sounds too convoluted? Just think of how easy it is to do and the potential to make money. The question isn’t “is it done” but “how much is it done” because if you create the opportunity, people will always find a way. This is also why ITV don’t simply fire Piers Morgan. As long as they can maintain the scam there is no reason to get rid of their main cash cow. Exactly as I submitted this the story broke that Piers resigned (was sacked). I guess ITV calculated that the money they were making from the drama he created wasn’t going to outweigh the PR backlash from this. He overstepped his bounds and thought he was immune to consequences. A fatal egotistical mistake and the old windbag is gone. 🤗"},{"instruction":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","output":"This depends on if I'd been contacted or not.

He sparked up some arbitrary small talk and we had to of been noticably uncomfortable. So he tries asking us if we can get him some weed and I thought to myself sure but my gut was screaming at me. Every time we tried to pull out of the conversation he was following up with some other weird series of questions. So my buddy acted like he was calling to see about getting the man some weed and walked off briefly. That was what seemed like the longest phone call cus I was standing there awkwardly and severely on edge with that mammoth weirdo by myself. He got real quiet for a few minutes and glared at me almost like he was sizing me up, standing unnervingly close to me. Money later my buddy came back and said that he couldn't get ahold of anyone and it was like the guy didn't even care about that any more. Not long after the police pulled up because that's who my buddy really called and they start questioning the guy and another cop took us around the corner to talk. One of the cops that had searched the guy walked up. The cop asked how we knew the man. We said we don't and he started off telling us about their search. They said he had a gun in his coat and on his ankle along with 1000 dollars in 1 dollar bills also in his coat and the cops said he couldn't give them a good enough reason to why he was down there and even made the cops feel uneasy. But had arrested him for not having a permit to carry and for having a firearm at a bar. Seen him again at court for unrelated reasons. I don't know why he was there but I wasn't there for that reason. He walked up and asked me how he knew me that I looked familiar and right then my attorney called me in the court room and I never seen him again. Thank God! I ended up seeing him in court"},{"instruction":"What are some arguments I can make to fight a fire hydrant ticket? The hydrant was blue and I thought it was a paranoid homeowner who installed a private fire hydrant for his own use. There were no red lines or signs saying no parking.","output":"First off, the color of the hydrant means nothing where the law is concerned. It's also common knowledge that you don't park in front of a hydrant. As has been mentioned, if the fire department needed that hydrant while you were parked there, they would've likely busted your windows and ran a hose through the vehicle. You'd also still get a ticket on top of having two windows to replace (which I doubt would be covered by insurance since you were at fault for parking in front of a hydrant).

However, like the story I’m going to share, I believe we’re all headed in the same direction. Many questions about life’s challenges are perhaps best explained in metaphors. This question reminds me of the story of the Tortoise and the Hare my grandfather so often told me. The Hare Swift, versatile, agile, clever and fast. Tortoise Slow, physically challenged, clumsy but intelligent and smart Once a upon a time the Hare bragged before other animals that he was the fastest and most speedy animal on land. “I have never yet been beaten when I put forth my full speed”, he said. “I challenge any one here to race with me.\\" The Tortoise said slowly, \\"I accept your challenge.\\" \\"That’s a big joke,\\" said the Hare; \\" You can’t even run. I could dance around you all the way. I prefer to race the Cheetah or Gazelle. Racing you is a waste of time.\\" “Hahahahahaaah!”, the rest of the animals laughed at and ridiculed Tortoise. \\"Keep your bragging till you've won,\\" answered the Tortoise. \\"Shall we race?\\" So the race was agreed and fixed on a certain day, place and time. To further humiliate the Tortoise and demean his self-confidence, the Hare went around bragging to all the other animals about how the Tortoise was slow, lazy and clumsy and how he was sure of beating the Tortoise clean, even without effort. Everybody knew that Tortoise was the slowest animal. After all, The Hare was more clever, versatile and faster than the Tortoise. He was sure he could even give the Tortoise a head start and still win the race. Meanwhile, the Tortoise consulted with other tortoises. The other tortoises had an idea. They told the Tortoise that they would help him win the race. “How?”, asked the Tortoise. “You’ll see”, they told him. “You just go and prepare for the race.” On the eve of the fateful day, the tortoises went and mobilized all the other tortoises and positioned each tortoise at regular intervals along the course of the race. Finally, when the big day arrived, both the Tortoise and the Hare stood at the start line, waiting for the signal. Not wanting to miss any of the fun, all the other animals of the animal kingdom were there to witness the duel. More importantly, most animals wanted to see why the Tortoise had such confidence to beat the Hare, despite being aware that he was no match for the Hare. When the signal went off, the Hare didn’t even bother to take off in a hurry. He was so sure of himself. He waited until the Tortoise had plodded for some 10 minutes, and then started running, slowly but surely. Meanwhile, the Tortoise only plodded on for some 50 meters before he was overtaken by the Hare. And so the Hare ran and ran, sure that he had nothing to worry about. After another 100 meters, he saw a Tortoise right ahead of him. He wondered how the Tortoise had overtaken him. He was puzzled, but kept on running, overtaking the Tortoise and being unsure of himself. He was sure that his mind was playing tricks on him. After another 100 meters, the Hare saw another Tortoise but thought it was the same Tortoise. He could not tell whether this was a different tortoise since they all looked alike. But the Hare kept going, not suspecting even for a moment that this was a different tortoise. There were no regulators along racing courses those days, since this was animal kingdom, therefore some of the animals were at the start line, while most of the animals were at the finish line. The race continued. By now the Hare had gotten tired of seeing the Tortoise ahead of him every 50 or 100 meters. After what seemed like an eternity, the Hare was completely worn out and very tired from the running. He was now really confused to see the Tortoise ahead of him at every turn, yet he was sure he had overtaken him several times. He was sure he was just having a bad dream. As he approached the finish line, he saw the Tortoise afar off near the finish line. He didn’t get it. Either something had gone seriously wrong or he was just imagining things. He hoped this was just a nightmare and he would soon get over it. By now the Tortoise was only a few feet from the finish line. How did the Tortoise get here? With only a couple of feet to go, all the other animals were cheering the Tortoise on. Even the other animals were not aware this was a different tortoise. They all looked alike; They couldn’t tell the difference. The Hare panicked as he summoned all his remaining strength and collapsed just before he got to the finish line. This gave the Tortoise enough time to cross the finish line first and comfortably. Every other animal was stunned. This was a shock defeat. Tortoise was declared the winner. Then the Tortoise said: \\"Slowly but surely, steady progress wins the race.\\" Indeed, slow but steady progress wins the race. That’s the case even until this day. Still trying to figure out what strategy the Tortoise used to win the race? This fable illustrates the realities of life. The people who win the race are not necessarily the people who play a fair game. The people who win the race are the people who know the power of leverage. Coupled with an opportunity, leverage always wins the race over genius, cleverness, speed, strength, effort and time. Working smarter is 100 times better than working hard. Leveraging what other people can do for you is 1,000 times better than working smarter. There’s a strange Bible verse that summarizes everything: “I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn't always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn't always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don't always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.” —Ecclesiastes 9:11 (New Living Translation) If you enjoyed reading my answer then consider giving it a vote.

What is Hashish and Hashish History?","output":"Hashish, also called hash, is a cannabis concentrate that is traditionally made by compressing and then processing the parts of the cannabis plant that makes humans feel medicated. These parts are the flowering buds, and more specifically, called trichomes. These trichomes are found in a concentrated form when broken off of a plant, which is a fine powder called kief. If you’ve ever broken up cannabis flower with your hands and got sticky crystals on them as a result, you had some kief on your hands. Depending on how hash is made, it can appear as a number of different colors and have various textures. For instance, Moroccan hash is made by repeatedly applying significant pressure to kief. Ice water bubble hash is made by stirring the harvested plant material in an ice bath, which detaches the trichomes. The trichomes are then filtered through mesh bags called bubble bags, which collect the unusable plant matter and allow trichomes to pass through. Hash Has a History Hash is the oldest concentrate that we currently know of. History tells us that hash was consumed in Central and South Asian cultures many years before raw, dried cannabis flower was consumed. In fact, some people in these cultures may have looked down upon anyone who happened to consume the flower alone. Cannabis flower was often seen as an unrefined, crude product that is only suitable for consumption by peasants. Of course, we know today that this is not the case. Additionally, we have many other ways of making hash today as well. How is Hashish Made? Hash is most commonly made by pressing kief. Kief is the collected crystals of cannabis flower, which are called trichomes. The kief is heated and pressurized, which forms the well-known pressed, brown-colored substance. The reason hash turns its iconic brown is because of the pressure required to properly extract the cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds. Another popular method of making hash is bubble hash. This method uses ice water and mesh materials to separate trichomes and form them into hash."},{"instruction":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","output":"Both religious and sex discrimination are covered by the same law: the Civil Rights Act of 1964. According to the law, you are not allowed to discriminate on such bases (called protected classes) unless there is a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification: that is a real, business reason for the discrimination. So if the employee will not be meeting one on one with clients, works alone and only attends group meetings, and there is no other discriminatory action done by the employee, then it may be a violation of the Act to fire or punish him for this. If the nature of the job requires private one-on-one meetings, then this is a BFOQ, and you can discriminate on that basis. The law also says that a business needs to provide “reasonable accommodations” for people’s religious beliefs, sex-related needs, disabilities etc. So if there is a problem that has a readily available solution, such as having an HR person present during any one-to-one meeting with their boss or subordinate, then legally, the company would have to provide it. (Off hand the most relevant case I can think of is when a Muslim truck driver found that he could not deliver beer or alcohol due to his religion. The truck company was required to allow the driver to change places with other drivers so that he could continue to work, and avoid delivering alcohol.) So dismissing him blatantly due to his religious beliefs may very well be a violation of the Civil Rights Act. However, it is quite possible that this person’s beliefs may lead to the appearance of a hostile attitude toward women in the workplace, and this would also be a violation of the Act. So the company should make reasonable accommodations and also monitor the situation to make sure that it doesn’t lead to a hostile work environment."},{"instruction":"it safe to apply aloe vera gel on the face overnight?","output":"Applying aloe vera gel on the face overnight is a common practice in skincare routines due to its potential benefits.

I think that critiquing for most readers is to some extent automatic and also part of becoming an attentive and thoughtful reader. In that sense, practice makes perfect: the more you read, the more skilled you are at critique. The practice of critique as a reader is about recognizing things you like and things you don’t like in a particular book. It is about grasping an argument and being able to determine its strengths and weaknesses. It is about a constant exploration of language, the denotation and connotation of words, the construction of meaning and pleasure. In that sense, critiquing also helps you examine language and conclusions no matter how they come at you: from teachers, religious leaders, political figures and political pundits, advertising and the conversations we have in the course of an ordinary day. I think, in the end, it is not the critiquing that helps the reader—it is the reading that helps the reader become a person capable of logical, factually supported and informed critique."},{"instruction":"IQ a good measurement of one’s intelligence?","output":"No, a person has their own skills and expert on something."},{"instruction":"As an American, do you agree that statistics that show the US way down low at #37 for quality of healthcare is farleft propaganda that folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand love to repeat, when in reality the US is always #1?","output":"I agree that this is just one of many crude questions trying to drive a wedge between America and “Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand” and I hope that God judges you for your wickedness."},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"No but I have not rented in almost 10 years"},{"instruction":"What is a candid picture?","output":"My father loved clicking our pictures when we were young and whenever I read about or see a candid picture my mind jogs back to few of my childhood pictures with my brother where he was tired of clicking pictures with me..

The same type of metal or different types of metals are heated until red hot and pliable. Then, they are placed together and hammered until they become one piece of metal. While there are some people who still practice forge welding, the process isn’t used much anymore by singular blacksmiths, although some rural and rustic people such as the Amish, still use these techniques for joining metals. More popular and common are factory forges which accomplish the same process but on a much larger scale.

Wash your hands with the luxurious soap you received as a housewarming gift. Drink that bottle of amazing wine right away. Don’t save things for future use — because who knows what the future looks like?”“Exercise adds 20 degrees.” For example, “if it’s 28 degrees out and it seems too cold to go running,” Rory Evans wrote, “once you get moving, it’ll feel like it’s 48 degrees. And that, you can handle.”“Touch it once.” According to Christine H., this household hint involves putting something away the first time you pick it up. That way, “you don’t have to waste energy looking at it (and feeling guilty), or letting it get dusty so you have to clean it before putting it away.”“Sleep on his side of the bed.” Mattie Scott heard this advice at her husband’s funeral. “It’s truly the best piece of advice I’ve ever gotten,” she notes. “The effect was profoundly comforting, and it greatly lessened the ache of missing his physical presence.”“Things don’t have to be perfect to be wonderful.” Gail Dekker first heard her friend, a wedding coordinator, offer these words to young couples whose emotions were running high. But it works in all kinds of situations, including Ms. Dekker’s house hunt. “My initial reaction was that there was something wrong with every condo I saw. My friend reminded me: A place didn’t have to be perfect to be wonderful. She was right.”“Take a breath.” Melissa Fanning heard this from a yoga teacher (“at a corporate retreat about which I remember nothing else”). It wasn’t a yoga instruction; it was a suggestion to pause at stressful moments, to avoid saying or doing something regrettable. “I use this advice every day,” Ms. Fanning wrote. “It has preserved peace, calmed me, and made me appear smarter than I am.”“You can’t control other people’s actions, but you can control your reaction to them.” Kim Radich uses this advice daily. “For example, when a family member reacted negatively to a situation, I remembered I can’t control their behavior, and I let it roll off my back.”“Just be a gentleman.” Harry Kelly admits that this advice “may sound corny.” But that guidance came from his mother at a heightened emotional moment: as she dropped him off at college shortly after his father had died. “It means not taking advantage of other people and trying to adhere to your moral values,” he wrote. “Her advice has kept me from doing some bad things and encouraged me to do what is right.

I think PV is a very viable source even though a PV module may only be 20% efficient in converting “free” sunlight into electrical energy. The cheapest renewable energy generator to build is probably still PV. Using “reasonable numbers”, I am not in the business so my numbers are based on stuff I read. If it costs 1.25/W to build a utility scale PV system, the cost is amortized over a useful life of 20 years, and every watt of capacity produces 1.3kW of production per year. The wholesale cost per kWh produced over that lifetime is just under .05 per kWh. A system is likely to last much longer than 20 years at nearly full output so over the long term PV is very cheap. PV has a drawback that it only produces full power for a few hours per day so if it is the primary source of generation it will need a lot of batteries. Tesla claims to be making batteries at under 100/kWh of capacity (.10 per watt hour). If it takes 8 Wh of capacity for every watt of PV capacity, then the batteries required will add an extra .80 to the cost. That puts the cost of a 24–7 generator at 2.05 per watt. That would add at least 40% to the lifetime cost per kWh, to perhaps .07/kWH. That assumes that the batteries last for 20 years, E. Musk says they will but he is an extreme optimist when describing his products, so it is probably safe to presume a battery life of not much over 10 years. That would still come out to a cost per kWh under .10, and after 20 years much less. A PV system requires very little operational personnel and it requires very little maintenance. That makes it very cheap to operate. PV generation can be “modular” allowing stations to be widely distributed in a service area and can be adjusted in size easily if there is sufficient area with adequate solar exposure. Comparing battery backed PV to a “base-load” generator, even in a very uniformly sunny location the capacity factor is only about a tenth of the nameplate capacity due to intermittency of generation and losses in the battery, and “curtailment” issues when the battery is charged and the array could over produce the load. However that system would have extremely precise voltage and frequency control. It could be located very close to loads, reducing transmission losses, and it could be made to “island” from a failing grid making small widely distributed generating sites very robust. In a high latitude location with a dark winter it would need substantial supplement from other sources (perhaps wind). There will never be enough batteries to go with only PV from October to March in VT."},{"instruction":"What are some plastic surgery masterpieces?","output":"In the field of plastic surgery, there have been numerous cases where surgeons have achieved remarkable results, transforming and improving the appearance of individuals. While the term \\"masterpiece\\" is subjective and can vary based on individual preferences and cultural standards of beauty, here are a few examples of plastic surgery procedures that are often cited as notable successes: Facial Rejuvenation: Facelifts and neck lifts can provide significant improvements in facial aging by tightening sagging skin, smoothing wrinkles, and restoring youthful contours.Rhinoplasty: Nose reshaping surgery can successfully address aesthetic concerns such as size, shape, and symmetry, enhancing overall facial harmony.Breast Augmentation: Breast augmentation with implants can enhance breast size and shape, achieving desired proportions and providing a natural-looking outcome.Body Contouring: Procedures like liposuction, tummy tucks, and body lifts can sculpt and reshape the body by removing excess fat and skin, resulting in a more toned and proportionate appearance.Breast Reconstruction: [LINKED_TEXT: Plastic surgeons] [URL: https://www.medanta.org/patient-education-blog/the-psychological-impact-of-plastic-surgery-benefits-and-considerations] perform breast reconstruction procedures to restore the shape and appearance of the breast following mastectomy.

Some of our friends including my girlfriend (in picture) took the initiative of cooking some sort of a interesting snack.

I know which why I go. C++ is faster. C# is generally easier to use. Blueprints are faster to develop on than C# - if I’m just doing BP then its just a matter of wiring things together so prototyping is much faster. Unreal has solid networking built in. Unity also has networking but their replication isn’t as good and has performance issues. It’s also a pain to debug failed RPC calls when you lack source access. UI is easier in Unity.

Almost 20 years before he actually converted, Ambedkar addressed the Mahars – a section of the community considered untouchable – in Mumbai, apprising them of his decision to convert. In a lengthy yet heavily influential [LINKED_TEXT: speech] [URL: http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_salvation.html#2], Ambedkar urged: “… religion is for man and not man for religion.

Convert for getting liberty.” And although Ambedkar did not live long enough to practice a religion he so-well espoused – dying only two months after his official conversion – he led several thousands to adopt his re-interpretation of the religion.

Alcohol: Pros: Alcohol is widely available and socially accepted, making it easy to access.In moderation, alcohol can have a relaxing effect, reducing stress and promoting social bonding.Some studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may have potential health benefits, such as reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Cons: Alcohol is a depressant that impairs judgment, motor skills, and cognitive function. This can increase the risk of accidents and dangerous behavior.Long-term heavy drinking can cause serious health problems, including liver damage, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.Alcohol can also lead to addiction and alcoholism, which can have a devastating impact on both physical and mental health. Marijuana: Pros: Marijuana has been shown to have therapeutic benefits for certain medical conditions, such as reducing chronic pain, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improving sleep quality.Unlike alcohol, marijuana does not cause serious health problems such as liver damage or heart disease.Some studies have also suggested that marijuana may have potential therapeutic benefits for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Cons: Marijuana can impair judgment, coordination, and memory, which can increase the risk of accidents and dangerous behavior.Long-term heavy marijuana use has been associated with an increased risk of certain health problems, such as respiratory issues, mental health problems, and decreased cognitive function.Marijuana can also lead to addiction, which can have a negative impact on one's personal and professional life. It's important to note that while alcohol and marijuana both have pros and cons, the most important factor is individual use. Substance use should always be done in moderation, and individuals should be aware of the potential health and social risks associated with their use. Additionally, it's important to seek professional help if you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse or addiction."},{"instruction":"Brie Larson wants to do an all female Avengers movie. Do you think there should be an all female Avengers movie and would you go watch it?","output":"In general, I believe all female character movies are just fine… if they are realistic. For example: an all female coming of age story set in an all female orphanage or boarding school or camp. This is NOT the type of all female movies people want to see. They want to see superhero movies or adventure movies, which is much more unrealistic. A mostly female action/adventure would be really cool. Perhaps an all female team of explorers/adventures but with male characters as friends, family members, or business partners. A great example of this sort of thing is the Pitch Perfect movies. Most of the main characters are female and it has many empowering themes while also keeping a realistic setting (note: a movie with all male characters is equally unrealistic in MOST cases. Even in war, women have served as cooks or nurses.) I would enjoy a mostly female Marvel movie if it was done right. This means that it fits in with the rest of the movies, the characters are believable (for example they have been training a very long time to be able to defeat powerful villains, like Black Widow), and the main characters have some relationships (not necessarily romantic) with male charcters. I would NOT appreciate a reboot of a male character(s) with female characters in which the plot, world, and character arcs are the exact same as the original. There are a few too many of these and they are getting boring. You want to make an action movie with a female lead and cast that is similar to another already existing story? Okay, that’s just fine. Just PLEASE give the movie it’s own characters, plot, and quirks. Lara Croft is a good example of this. She is very similar to Indiana Jones but she is her own person and not just a re-gendered copy. In short, as a female, I would like to see movies with more female characters. However, I want to see original and realistic plots with likeable and original characters. I don’t want to see bad remakes or repeats of movies where everything is the same except the lead character is a girl with very little personality."},{"instruction":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","output":"Hey guys agar aap gym ja rahe hain aur aapke pass protein lene ke paise nahin hai to aap ghar per hi nahin behtarin khana ko khakar apni protein ki Kami ko pura kar sakte hain [LINKED_TEXT: Muscle building High Protein food] [URL: https://bingsexy.blogspot.com/2020/10/muscle-building-high-protein-food.html] is link per aap jakar dekh sakte hain yahan per main kuchh high protein food aapke liye diye Hai Jis mein milk chicken face aur bhi kaisi chij hain aap jakar dekh sakte hain aur ismein kuchh sasti chijen bhi hai please aap bahut hi kam paison mein khareed sakte hain"},{"instruction":"Should I eat McDonald's or Burger King?","output":"Eat what you want to eat"},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"There are several great options available for car enthusiasts seeking a budget-friendly yet feature-packed vehicle under 10 lakhs in India.

Just take a sheet of paper and pen down your thoughts. It is better to write something than nothing.Different writers’ brains need different things: Every writer has his/her own unique sense of processing and expressing his viewpoint about circumstances, situations and events. You don’t have to follow any guidelines and fit a specific mould, rather you shoud write with a free flow of thoughts.Learn to handle writer’s block: Searching for the perfect place to write, designing a special writing cape, and/or waiting for a new moon are procrastination not preparation. Stop faffing, stop fetishising, start writing.Be consistent: You all should know that Rome was not built in a day. So to enhance your writing skills, you should write daily. You ought to produce words regularly and finish what you started and do it again.Write on the basis of prompts: Select some keywords and try to write a composition or a piece of writing based on them. Put your characters in strange places and conditions and feel free to write.If you want to write, you need to be curious. You have to eavesdrop and be nosy, explore new roads, and open closed doors. You have to be a magpie, and build your stories from the treasures you find and steal.Becoming a published author is a magical blend of tenacity, talent, timing, and luck. My biggest piece of advice is to learn to not take rejection personally and to not give up. Easier said than done, but just keep going. Keep writing, keep trying. You’ll get there. Hope this helps!

From the early 1930s until the early 1990s when Bill Clinton manipulated the party rightward with his “triangulation” scheme to get elected, the Democrats were actually FURTHER left than all but a few are today. Throughout that time the US had the most stable economy and a government that served (most of) the people more than the corporate interests that control it now. That was before the Vietnam war, when corporate greed kept that war (and every war since) going longer than needed for profit. It should be noted that throughout that 60+ years of traditional Democratic governing, the Great Depression was ended, Social Security was created, The G.I Bill was passed, atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons were banned, and The Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act became law. President Carter created the Department of Energy and the Department of Education in the mid 1970s, and forged a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt (when peace was more a priority than “for profit” war). Under President Clinton, the federal budget was balanced, and that helped the economy add 23 million new jobs to the US economy. Democratic control of Congress oversaw the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in history. Ever since then the Democratic Party has been methodically and systematically bought off by Wall Street and corporate greed, to the point that they are now hard to distinguish from the equally corporate controlled Republican Party. Some people are not even aware that free, or very low tuition was offered at public colleges and universities in this country before Reagan and Republicans dismantled that public benefit. The marginal tax rate for the very wealthy was around 91% during the time of Eisenhower, and the economy was booming, and stable. The rich got richer, the middle class grew, and nobody left the country because they now had a vested interest in seeing the economy grow since they all had “skin in the game.” Greed and the Republican obsession with tax cuts ended that, and ever since then we have had periodic economic meltdowns and bank crashes, due to the inherent instability in our economy created by those greed-driven tax cuts and all the deregulation in the financial sector. Getting the government back to serving THE PEOPLE as it once did is NOT a radical idea. That is a mainstream idea. It’s what should have been the case all along, no matter how much the brainwashed and willfully ignorant right wing suggests otherwise. History is clearly on the side of the left. By that I mean the REAL left and not this phony centrist “establishment” charade that claims to be progressive while serving the demands of Wall Street and corporate greed almost exclusively."},{"instruction":"Out of the 5 million illegal immigrants pouring over our southern and northern boarders, how many are criminals and terrorists?","output":"Every single one of them are criminals.

Baby is flummoxed, and out of her depth, and not knowing what to say, blurts out something completely lame. Real people don’t talk in witty, quotable soundbites, they say lame things, pretty much all of the time. Making a character human, often requires them to say something that was intentionally scripted to be lame. But can we honestly say George Lucas knew that? You tell me. Okay, in all fairness Harrison Ford ad-libbed those lines, they weren’t in the script, but they are even more beloved than anything to do with watermelons. But let’s be clear, when you talk to people about who is the coolest of the good guys in Star Wars, Han Solo more often than not, takes the gold. And he says something excruciatingly lame, and we all loved him for it. Anakin however, didn’t get the same benefit of the doubt. Because people were wanting him to be Darth Vader, they didn’t want him to be young and out of his depth, but out of his depth he was, when chatting up someone who just so happened to be- A former queen. A member of the galactic senate. Intelligent and accomplished. Beautiful. Because, you know, Natalie Portman. The woman that he loves. Older than him to the point that she remembers him as a child. All of which makes her somewhat of an intimidating figure, for anyone to try and chat up, but more so for someone who is- A Virgin. Just as Padme sees him as a kid, the audience sees him as Darth Vader, but he is neither of those things, he’s not a child and he’s not (yet), one of cinemas most badass villains, he’s Anakin Skywalker, virgin. If you put aside your expectations of who you want him to be, who he is going to be, and look at who he is at that period of his life, then “I hate sand” suits his charater to a tee, because it is perfectly lame."},{"instruction":"What’s the most important thing to know when you want to learn how to use a ham radio?","output":"There is no single thing… Amateur radio is a technical hobby operating in a regulated environment."},{"instruction":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","output":"The idea of large or “big” dogs is not a new concept. People have been breeding large dogs for centuries, and there are many breeds that are considered large. However, compared to some of the largest wild cats such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, these dogs are not considered to be “big” in the same way. This begs the question, why are there no big dogs? To answer this, it is important to look at the evolutionary history of both cats and dogs. Cats and dogs both evolved from ancient carnivorous mammals. Cats evolved from the Felidae family, while dogs evolved from the Canidae family. Though they share similarities, cats and dogs have distinct differences in their evolutionary history and development. Cats are considered to be apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. This led to the development of cats being solitary hunters and having a natural instinct to protect themselves from danger. Cats also evolved to have longer bodies, larger heads, and powerful claws for hunting prey. Their agility, strength, and stealth are unmatched in the animal kingdom. This allowed cats to evolve into larger species, such as lions, tigers, and jaguars, to better hunt their prey. Dogs, on the other hand, evolved from a pack-based hunter and scavenger lifestyle. Dogs’ survival depended on their ability to work together in a group and hunt or scavenge whatever food they could find. This led to the development of dogs having shorter bodies, smaller heads, and weaker claws for scavenging. Dogs are not considered to be apex predators, and therefore have not evolved into larger species like cats have. In addition, the domestication of dogs has also played a role in the lack of large dogs. Cats were domesticated much later than dogs, and their domestication has not altered their natural predatory instincts as much as it has with dogs. Dogs, on the other hand, have been domesticated for thousands of years and have developed a close relationship with humans. This has led to the selective breeding of dogs to be smaller and less aggressive, and has eliminated any natural instinct to survive without human help. The combination of evolutionary history and domestication has led to the lack of large breeds of dogs. Cats were able to evolve into larger species due to their natural predatory instincts, while dogs were bred to be smaller and less aggressive due to their domestication. Therefore, when it comes to large or “big” dogs, there are simply none that exist today. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

You can use tools like SurveyMonkey, Typeform, Google Forms, etc. to create surveys and polls and ask your audience about their opinions, preferences, challenges, etc. Disclose Affiliate Links The third step to start making money online with affiliate marketing is to disclose affiliate links. Affiliate links are the unique links that you use to promote products or services as an affiliate marketer. These links allow the seller or the affiliate network to track who made the sale and pay you a commission. Disclosing affiliate links means informing your audience that you are using affiliate links and that you may earn a commission if they click on them and make a purchase. Disclosing affiliate links is not only ethical and transparent but also required by law in many countries. According to the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)], affiliates must clearly disclose their relationship with the seller when they endorse or promote a product or service online. Failure to do so may result in legal action or penalties. To disclose affiliate links properly, you should: Place a clear and conspicuous disclosure near the affiliate link or at the beginning of the content that contains the affiliate link. The disclosure should be easy to see and understand by your audience and not hidden or buried in the content.Use clear and simple language to explain that you are using affiliate links and that you may earn a commission if they click on them and make a purchase. You should avoid using vague or confusing terms like “partner link”, “support us”, “sponsored link”, etc. Instead, you should use terms like “affiliate link”, “commission link”, “referral link”, etc.Repeat the disclosure whenever you use an affiliate link in your content. You should not assume that your audience will see or remember your disclosure if you only place it once in your content. You should repeat the disclosure every time you use an affiliate link to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding. Leverage on Multichannel Strategy The fourth step to start making money online with affiliate marketing is to leverage on multichannel strategy. Multichannel strategy means using different online platforms and channels to reach and engage with your target audience and drive traffic to your affiliate links. Leveraging on multichannel strategy will help you: Increase your online presence and visibility and attract more potential customers from different sources.Diversify your income streams and reduce your dependence on one single channel or platform.Test and optimize your affiliate marketing campaigns and find out what works best for your niche, audience, and products or services. Some of the most popular and profitable online platforms and channels for affiliate marketing are: Blogging. Blogging is one of the most common and effective ways to do affiliate marketing. You can create a blog on your own website or use platforms like [WordPress], [Medium], [Blogger], etc. to create and publish content related to your niche and the products or services that you promote. You can use tools like Yoast SEO, SEMrush, Ahrefs, etc. to optimize your blog for search engines and drive organic traffic to your affiliate links.Email marketing. Email marketing is another powerful way to do affiliate marketing. You can use tools like Mailchimp, ConvertKit, AWeber, etc. to build an email list of subscribers who are interested in your niche and the products or services that you promote. You can then send them regular newsletters, updates, offers, etc. with your affiliate links and persuade them to buy from you.Social media marketing. Social media marketing is also a great way to do affiliate marketing. You can use platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, etc. to create and share content related to your niche and the products or services that you promote. You can also use tools like Buffer, Hootsuite, Later, etc. to schedule and manage your social media posts and drive traffic to your affiliate links. Use Key Performance Indicators to Track Your Progress The fifth step to start making money online with affiliate marketing is to use key performance indicators (KPIs) to track your progress. KPIs are measurable values that indicate how well you are achieving your goals and objectives as an affiliate marketer. Using KPIs will help you: Monitor and evaluate your affiliate marketing performance and results.Identify what is working well and what needs improvement in your affiliate marketing campaigns.Make data-driven decisions and adjustments to optimize your affiliate marketing strategies and tactics. Some of the most common and useful KPIs for affiliate marketing are: Traffic. Traffic is the number of visitors who come to your website, blog, social media page, podcast, etc. where you have placed your affiliate links. Traffic is an indicator of how popular and visible your online platform or channel is and how many potential customers you can reach with your affiliate links.Click-through rate (CTR). CTR is the percentage of visitors who click on your affiliate links out of the total number of visitors who see them. CTR is an indicator of how effective and attractive your affiliate links are and how much interest they generate among your audience.Conversion rate (CR). CR is the percentage of visitors who click on your affiliate links and make a purchase out of the total number of visitors who click on them. CR is an indicator of how successful you are at converting your audience into customers and how well the products or services that you promote match their needs and preferences.Revenue. Revenue is the amount of money that you earn from your affiliate sales. Revenue is an indicator of how profitable your affiliate marketing business is and how much commission you receive from the sellers or the affiliate networks.

But still, they have to pay a bribe to the police to get a passport. A few of my Bangladeshi friends actually have a Bangladeshi and an Indian passport to enter the Arab world. They mentioned about benevolent Indian chief minister from neighboring West Bengal state. She has arranged a scheme for Bangladeshis to have an Indian passport. It costs between 200–300k INR. They said they had to pay agents and passports will be sent to them by her party workers. We don’t need a foreign passport to travel like them.

But I am not sure that he will be able to win this fight even with EMS because of two things - Tobirama’s FTG provides him speeds that can overwhelm Madara; Madara’s elementa affinity is Fire whereas Tobirama’s is Water, and Water > Fire in every scenario. In the Senju vs Uchiha brothers fight, if Tobirama was fighting Madara, then the same thing that happened to Izuna would have happened to his older brother.

So if the strings are all playing the same thing in one passage, you wouldn’t go to the trouble in short score of writing out all the violin, viola and cello parts, because you know they’re all playing in unison. Some composers might compose things on the piano and then write them down, but that’s just so they can hear what it sounds like. It would be quite a lot of trouble to arrange an entire symphony into a playable piano piece (although Liszt did it for a couple of Beethoven’s symphonies), so what they do instead is write out the basic stuff using as many staves as they need, and then fill in the details later. Fun fact: Arnold Schoenberg composed his vast song cycle Gurre-Lieder in short score between 1900 and 1903, and then stopped working on it because the prospect of orchestrating it was just too much for him to handle, at that point, and he had other things to do. (The orchestra for the work is so huge and there are so many staves that he had to order special music manuscript paper.) He didn’t take it up again until 1910, and finished it in 1911. It premiered in 1913, by which time his music had changed so much, and his more recent music had been so drastically unpopular, that when the premiere was a huge success he was completely unmoved, feeling like the audience were applauding the kind of composer he’d been thirteen years earlier."},{"instruction":"LPU good for taking admission in the CSE branch?","output":"Of Course!!

Here's a comparison of both approaches: Traditional Book Publishing:Pros:Credibility: Traditional book publishing is often perceived as more prestigious and carries a certain level of credibility.Wide Reach: Printed books are available in bookstores, libraries, and other physical outlets, allowing for potential exposure to a broader audience.Tangibility: Holding a physical book can be a cherished experience for many readers, and some prefer the tactile nature of printed books. Cons:Time-Consuming: Traditional publishing involves a longer process, including finding a literary agent, securing a publishing deal, editing, printing, and distribution, which can take months or even years.Higher Costs: Publishing physical books often requires significant upfront costs for printing and distribution.Royalties: Royalty rates for traditionally published authors are typically lower than for self-published ebook authors.

Ultimately, the \\"better\\" way to earn money depends on your specific goals, circumstances, and writing style. If you have a significant following and desire the prestige of traditional publishing, going the traditional route might be a good fit. On the other hand, if you want to retain control, publish quickly, and have the potential for higher royalties, self-publishing ebooks could be a better choice.

What would have happened if China's population was allowed to grow unabated?","output":"It’s not clear, to be honest. It was fashionable for developing countries in the late 20th century to deliberately reduce the fertility rate. China stands out for the brutal manner it executes the policy, not for having such policy in the first place. Many countries seem to regret it today. An imporant idea behind the fertility reduction is to ensure that each child can get a lot of human capital investment. That said, population growth, if managed well, is a source of economic growth too. Besides that, human capital investment on girls also reduces fertility rate (because women have better things to do than to get impregnated repeatedly). The latter is the one of the reasons most developed countries have a low fertility rate. Another important idea behind the fertility reduction is resource limitation. However, this conveniently ignores human innovation. There are more humans today than at any other time in history, yet instead of starving we are threatened by obesity, thanks to innovations and market reorganization of agriculture. What would happen if there were no One Child Policy? Most likely the fertility rate would decline, anyway. As women get more options in their life and the value of human capital investment outgrows the value of raw brawn, while parents’ time became more precious, most likely people would have less children anyway. The rate drop would likely be less drastic, though."},{"instruction":"Why did JFK have affairs?","output":"Because he was a serial cheater."},{"instruction":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","output":"Canadians feel a great sense of community but, having recently been in Seattle it’s pretty nice there too in the downtown area.

It takes many years, lifetimes, of the practice of the higher techniques of pranayama to reach pratyahara. Pranayama means energy control. One learns to withdraw the energy from the sensory nerves to the spine and brain and to calm the heart and breath. Unless you can cut off all sensations from your consciousness you cannot reach God through the silence of intuition. Jesus was speaking of pratyahara when he told his disciples, “And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off”. - Mark 9 :43 He meant, cut off the energy in the sensory nerves. “True communion with God is not achieved by mere outer silence, but takes place in the inner silence of interiorized mental stillness (pratyahara).” “To detach the attention from the senses and thoughts, and place it on God only, is called meditation.” “The silence of deep meditation is not an unconscious state, but an expansion of consciousness from the boundaries of the body into boundless eternity.” “Calmness is the throne of God.” “The experience of joy in meditation is communion with God.” _ Paramhansa Yogananda See: Yogananda org or Ananda org"},{"instruction":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","output":"Hi, Microsoft itself provide features to convert non corrupt PDF after open and solving it.

It introduced unheard-of data prices, with 1GB of data costing only 0.26, compared to a staggering 12.37 in the US (47 times more expensive). Moreover, Jio made calling free across India, allowing users to connect with anyone on any mobile network or landline at no cost. Many wondered how Jio could turn a profit with such aggressive pricing. In India, interconnect charges (IUC) had to be paid to other networks when making calls to their numbers. For instance, if a Jio customer called an Airtel number, Jio had to pay IUC to Airtel. To mitigate these charges, Jio made a shrewd move. They reduced the ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks from 45 seconds to 20 seconds. This change meant that when a Jio customer called another network, the call would only ring for a short duration of 4-5 rings, resulting in missed calls. The recipient, typically an Airtel customer, would then return the call to the Jio customer. By exploiting this situation, Jio turned the tables, and now Airtel had to pay IUC charges to Jio instead. Jio effectively capitalized on a legal loophole and saved a significant amount in IUC charges, amounting to approximately 33 million (₹254 crore) in one quarter ending June 2019. This smart maneuver by Jio showcases the strategic thinking of the company. They recognized an opportunity, leveraged the situation, and effectively reversed the IUC payment dynamics. The approach was not only shrewd but also highly effective in gaining a competitive advantage. This move, orchestrated by Mr. Ambani and his team, exemplifies their astute business acumen. It is no surprise that Jio's success story has resonated with many, leaving Mr. Ambani and his team laughing all the way to the bank, as depicted in the image above."},{"instruction":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble.

However, it is facing a serious crisis now. The cities which used to face hard times managing tourists are now having hard times managing corpses as hundreds of people are losing their lives to the novel coronavirus every day. Nepali diplomatic authorities say there are 1,732 Nepalis currently living in Italy. Fortunately, no Nepali has been infected with the virus in Italy so far, according to the Non-resident Nepalis Association. Living indoors, these people seem frightened about the infection. At the same time, they also view that Nepal should learn lessons from Italy if it really wants to avoid any such situation in the near future. Here are the opinions of three Nepalis living in Italy as they expressed in conversations with Onlinekhabar recently. Goma Kharel Mantua, Italy I am from Mahendranagar of Nepal. I have been living in Mantua, Italy, for almost four years with my family. We have been living indoors since February 25. The situation outdoors is appalling. Over500 people are dying every day. The number of new cases has also been surging. All of these tragic scenarios definitely have disturbed our psyche. However, we are healthy. When there is an emergency or we require some essential goods for a living, then only we step outside of our house by wearing masks and putting sanitiser. After returning home, we wash our clothes immediately. The government has issued a notice stating that no one shall go to work till June 15. But returning to the old routine seems to take an additional two to four months as the newly infected cases are still increasing. Even if there will be no new infected cases, it will take time for all the infected to recover. The main cause of the uncontrollable spread of Covid-19 here is that people do not stay home even during the lockdown. It was in January when this disease began to spread viciously and at that time, it was not controlled. How many tourists from China visited Italy? Why Serie A football games were not suspended even after the infection was seen? No one cared. Even now, people have been coming out of their houses. We are frightened that we might get infected from coronavirus even when we come out of our house for buying some essential goods or for some urgent works. We are frightened even to meet other fellow Nepalis. Though some of the Nepalis are living five minutes away from my house, we have not met over the fear of coronavirus spread. Even when we enter the supermarket, we want to get out of there as soon as possible. In Nepal, the number of cases is increasing gradually. Thinking of what Nepalis are thinking now, the situation in Italy has been alarming. So, please stay indoors, use sanitiser and masks during this lockdown period. The more one stays indoors, the safer they are. Use necessary cautions while coming out of the house. Otherwise, one cannot say that Nepal will not face the tragic situation that Italy and Spain are struggling with now. Yes, one might feel bored and lethargic staying indoors all the time. One might wish to return to normal, everyday life as soon as possible. I have a seven-month-old baby and staying inside the home all the time with the child is tiring. I wish to go out and walk freely, go shopping and have lunch in restaurants. However, suppressing all these desires, we are more concerned about our health as of now. Bijay Bhusal Legnano, Italy I live in Legnano which is very near to Milan. My home in Nepal is in Sauraha, Chitwan. I have been living in Italy for almost 13 years now. I, my daughter and my mother are ‘quarantined’ inside our house due to the outbreak. No matter how harsh it has been, we have not stepped outside our home. Whenever there is a need to go out for buying essential goods, I go alone. Although, shopping centres follow all the necessary precautions like measuring body temperature, maintaining distance while being in line and so on, the fear of getting infected remains in my mind. My mother came here for treatment five years ago; only my father is in Nepal. As the house is large enough, there is a separate room for everyone. However, it has been very difficult for my mother to stay at home all the time. She keeps on asking when this pandemic will come to an end, what if it stays like this forever. Above all, we had been waiting for her surgery scheduled for this morning, but it later got postponed due to the crisis. The outbreak has only escalated now. It seems like the situation will not change for about a month and a half because of the negligence of Italians in the beginning. They did not stop doing parties and gatherings when the only prominent preventive measure of this disease is to maintain social distance. It was too late when the government strictly implemented clampdowns to control and contain the spread of this pandemic. Fortunately, all the Nepalis here are safe to date. But, still, some are compelled to go to their work. Nepalis residing in Parma are still going to their workplace as they work in the factories that produce daily essentials goods like pasta, milk, sugar, and so on. Nowadays, they are working more than their usual routine. We are frequently talking and they have informed me that they are working safely following all the precautions. There have been reports of a few coronavirus infection cases in Nepal as well. The government of Nepal needs to be aware of the mistakes that Italy did, learn from them and act immediately to control and contain the spread of this pandemic there. The government of Nepal has also announced a lockdown, and we, the people, should abide by this by staying at home. Don’t make the mistake of staying home all day but getting out in the evening. The virus does not differentiate between mornings and evenings. And, if the citizens do not comply with the government’s decision this time, the scenario will be worse than Italy. Don’t do the mistake thinking that I am young and I will not get infected. Let’s take care of the family. Let’s stop meetings and gatherings; better talk online. We have not even met Nepali brothers and sisters living nearby. Let’s do the same in Nepal as well. Baburam Shrestha Vazri, Italy I am originally from Butwal, Nepal. At the moment, I am in Vazri, Italy which is near the Switzerland border. It has already been around a month that we have been living indoors. I have been living in Italy for the past 18 years though I frequently travel to Nepal also. I had planned to go back to Nepal this winter, but could not leave my family here due to the virus outbreak of late. I feel that this vicious spread of coronavirus in Italy is the result of the extreme carelessness of the residents. I ordered masks from Nepal after some infected cases were reported in Italy. When I was shopping wearing a mask, most of them treated that mask is only worn by the infected persons. The media also promoted this thought. We were frightened to get infected so we continued putting on masks. Now, it is made mandatory for everyone to wear a mask. However, there are still some people who do not wear masks. As a consequence of this negligence, we are facing this hard time now. Unless one shows the symptoms, they are not tested. Whenever one informs that they have fever or cough, then only they send an ambulance and take the patient and put them in isolation. All of these have worsened the scenario here. Nepal should learn from the mistakes that Italy did and should find and check all the people who have entered Nepal from India and other countries. Then only, Nepal will be safe out of this pandemic. A computer rendering of the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus strain that causes COVID-19. Photo Courtesy: CDC Nepal government has introduced emergency measures such as closures of schools and colleges, imposed a ban on a gathering of over 25 people and arrival restrictions for passengers from Europe, the Middle East, Gulf countries, Malaysia, Turkey, South Korea, and Japan to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Misinformation and false claims about the pandemic, however, continue to spread especially through social media. We have examined several such claims being circulated among the users of social media in Nepal. Does gargling with warm water with salt or vinegar cure COVID-19? A meme circulating on Facebook and other social media platforms claim that gargling with warm water mixed with salt or vinegar can eliminate COVID-19. It claims that after the virus reaches the throat, it remains there for four days and causes coughing and throat pain. This meme circulating on social media in Nepal claims that drinking plenty of water, or gargling with warm water mixed with salt or vinegar removes the coronavirus from the throat. While Nepalis have traditionally used the solution as a domestic remedy for throat pain and coughing, there’s no evidence that it cures coronavirus. According to the US-based, gargling with warmed water mixed with salt/vinegar helps soothe a sore throat, but there’s no proof that it eliminates coronavirus. Does rinsing your nose with saline water help prevent COVID-19? It’s a misleading claim. It’s true that it can help people recover from the common cold, but it’s not a cure for the coronavirus. Debunking the myth, the (WHO) has said: “There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.” Can COVID-19 coronavirus survive on the surface of iron for 12 hours? A YouTube channel called [LINKED_TEXT: r] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUDZtxncjpY] posted a video claiming that coronavirus can survive for 12 hours on the surface of the iron. Though other tips the video has offered appeared to be accurate, this one is misleading. Aaerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel,” the report said. Will warm temperature help reduce the spread of the coronavirus? With the end of winter, the temperature is rising across Nepal. Claims that the rise of temperature above 30 degrees Celsius would help reduce the virus are being circulated on social media. But this claim is unsubstantiated. “Because the impact of influenza reduces with the onset of summer, many people seem to believe that it will help reduce the novel coronavirus from spreading during summer. As its name suggests, this is a new virus and we don’t have any evidence to support such a conclusion,” Pushpa Mani Khanal, a medical doctor, told South Asia Check. What latest researches say about COVID-19? The latest scientific researches on coronavirus have pointed out that one-third of the infections of the disease were spread by people who did not demonstrate any symptoms. One says that people infected with the disease may not show symptoms in the initial state. That’s why experts have recommended social distancing and maintaining a distance of six feet from other people. The ruling Nepal Communist Party, on Saturday, to suggest a constitution amendment proposal. However, the panel is in its stated mission as its members did not own its existence. Perhaps the most vocal critic of the so-called task force has been Subas Chandra Nembang, who led the 2015 constitution drafting process as the Constituent Assembly chairman. This calm leader is said to have a greater sense of sensitivity, hence he does not criticise anyone in the public. But why is he speaking against the crucial party decision this time? When Onlinekhabar asked him this question on Monday, Nembang suggested that the decision exposed that party leadership’s failure to run the party in the right way. Excerpts: Though you rejected the existence of the task force, the three members of the panel held an informal meeting this morning. What did you talk about? As the news about the ‘task force’ and constitution amendment has gone viral, we apparently talked about that issue. I do not think what the media have been reporting about the issue is true. I have not been informed about it, formally and officially. The media have also reported that the decision was made with a condition of keeping it secret. In a serious matter such as the constitution amendment, this is not the right way to follow. We hope the party has not done so. If the party has really made the decision, this is totally wrong. This will not give any advantage to the party, ourselves and the system. In reality, the party has been discussing the amendment issue since a long ago. It has been consulting Madhesi parties, such as the Samajwadi Party and the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, as well as Dalit and Janajati leaders. We once commented that the amendment demand was an irrelevant issue because the provincial and federal parliaments were not formed then. Now we have the structures and, hence, an amendment is possible. However, the amendment should be rational and should reflect the needs of the country and its people. A party like the NCP should play its role in amending the constitution for the country and the people. Even (drafting or amending) a general legal provision requires extensive discussions with all the parties and stakeholders; the issue of constitution amendment also demands consultations with political parties and the civil society. But this time, the rationale of the issue has not been established. The decision about the task force came out suddenly. I do not believe it. I asked the senior leader (Madhav Kumar Nepal) to communicate these issues to the party leadership as he is said to be the coordinator of the task force. After I expressed my views, Khim Lal [Devkota] also seconded me. Does it suggest that the decision about the task force will not be implemented now? I have seen the task force’s existence nowhere. I do not know anything about it. How can I comment on the decision? Fine, you and Devkota questioned the existence. What about the coordinator? He (Madhav Kumar Nepal) also responded to us positively. He said whatever we said were genuine and appropriate issues. Can we say that the task force then is a stillborn baby? I do not know if it was ever conceived. But what I am certain is that a serious and responsible party like the NCP cannot move forward this way. As a constitutional expert and the leader of the constitution drafting process, we would like to know your opinion about Bamdev Gautam’s demand that a National Assembly member is allowed to become the PM. I will express my views whenever there is a discussion about it (formally). Let me clarify that there had been sufficient discussions about the issue while drafting the constitution in the Constituent Assembly. We had studied examples from other countries and found that India had such a provision. But, India’s condition is different. Then, we decided on the provision of electing a House of Representatives member as the prime minister. The decision was made after a rigorous discussion. The parliamentary democratic system envisioned in the constitution is an improved parliamentary system, and the provision of electing a House of Representatives member as the PM is a key component of that improvement. We also introduced other provisions such as the prime minister does not face any no-confidence motion in the first two years and s/he cannot dissolve the House of Representatives. Such provisions were also incorporated to make sure that those losing the House of Representatives will not become a minister in the next five years. The question today is: is it appropriate to change the provisions introduced with such an extensive discussion just in the first two years of the first House? I have been stressing that we should move ahead based on our needs and rationale. So why do you think your party formed the task force? Are not there any leaders in the House of Representatives who are qualified to become the prime minister? I do not think so. Our comrades, both inside and outside the Federal Parliament, are competent. I do not think the party even discussed this issue from this angle. I even do not believe there was any effort made to change the existing provision about the prime minister’s election. I have a good rapport with comrade Bamdev. He has never talked with me about this issue. He is in favour of a directly elected prime minister. Whatever has been rumoured now, that he made efforts for this, is not true. This will not do anything good for us. Your party has been forming so many task forces these days. Doesn’t it suggest that the prime minister as the party chair is losing his grip on the party? What do you think as a leader close to him? As the prime minister, Oli has been a successful leader. I believe if he ever fails, that will mean our failure also. But I do not buy your statement that I am close to him. I am close to everyone. Recently, during the standing committee meeting, I had joked that if the party would ever think about expanding the secretariat, I should be included because everyone loved me. I am close to comrade Prachanda (executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal) also. I have closely worked with him regarding many issues. I believe the party is greater than a person and the country is greater than a party."},{"instruction":"What is a dofollow backlink?","output":"Dofollow backlinks are search engine follow and convey link authority to the linked website, which affects the linked page's search engine rankings.

Before the actual battle, the Allied (Russian and Austrian) leaders had many logistical problems among their leadership and caused plenty of problems for coordination among the Allies. The most glaring problem, was that the Russians used a different calendar than the Austrians, prompting a 12 day difference, and screwing up their already flawed plans. Once the battle began, the Grande Armee had taken a stand at Pratzen Heights, and started out by making his left flank look purposefully weak on the high ground, to entice the Russians into an attack. The left flank feigned retreat, and the Russians fell for it, and the Russian commander Mikhail Kutuzov gave General Frederick William of Buxhoeveden the A-OK to attack the left flank. Buxhoeveden advanced on the village of Tellnitz and engaged the left flank, which was commanded by Marshal Davout. Davout is able to hold the attack in place due to another Allied General - General Liechtenstein - deploying in the wrong direction, and delaying the rest of Buxhoeveden’s regiments. This gives Davout adequate time to bring in two extra regiments from the West to hold his ground. Once Liechtenstein finally extracates to the North, Buxhoeveden is finally able to march the rest of his troops to combat Davout’s. However, the Allied troops get bogged down in the Goldbach river, which allowed the French to continue to hold out. The Russian Emperor pressures Kutuzov to allow General Kollowrath to start advancing on the Left flank as well. Napoleon order’s Marshal Soult to intercept this attack, as it was exposed to attack from the sides while marching. This allowed Napoleon to split the enemy into pockets. The Allies then push the Northern Half of their army into an attack on the French. Napoleon orders Bernadotte, Murat, and the remaining Marshals to get into place for this attack. Meanwhile, on the Southern Front, Marshal Soult’s forces push back Kollowrath’s forces, and defeat one of his regiments. Soult then joins his forces with the Davout’s men and pushes the rest of the Allies’ southern forces out of the Battle. In the North, the entire Allied attack is pushed back and and forced to retreat. The day went to Napoelon, who delivered this speech to his men about the victory: \\"Soldiers: I am satisfied with you. In the Battle of Austerlitz you have justified all that I expected from your intrepidity. You have decorated your eagles with immortal glory. An army of one hundred thousand men, commanded by the Emperors of Russia and Austria, has been, in less than four hours, either cut in pieces or dispersed. Thus in two months the third coalition has been vanquished and dissolved. Peace can not now be far distant.

It is used for countering rockets, artillery & mortars (C-RAM) as well as aircraft, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. The genesis of the Iron Dome goes back to the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war, when the Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets into Israel. The following year, Israel announced that its state-run Rafael Advance Systems would come up with a new air defence system to protect its cities and people. It was developed with Israel Aerospace Industries. How does it work, and what makes it so effective? The Iron Dome has three main systems that work together to provide a shield over the area where it is deployed, handling multiple threats. It has a detection and tracking radar to spot any incoming threats, a battle management and weapon control system (BMC), and a missile firing unit. The BMC basically liaises between the radar and the interceptor missile.

Whether you have a sedentary job that requires you to sit for long periods of time or you are an active athlete, lower back pain can affect anyone. The good news is that there are a number of effective ways to get rid of lower back pain. In this article, we will discuss the most effective methods for managing lower back pain and getting back to a pain-free life. 1. Regular Exercise Exercising regularly is one of the most effective ways to prevent and manage lower back pain. Exercise helps to strengthen the muscles in the lower back, which can help to relieve pain and prevent future injuries. Some of the best exercises for lower back pain include low-impact activities like walking, swimming, and stretching. Yoga and Pilates are also great options as they focus on strengthening and stretching the muscles in the lower back, core, and hips. These workouts can be modified to fit any fitness level or physical limitations, making them suitable for anyone. 2. Improving Posture Poor posture is one of the leading causes of lower back pain. Hunching over a desk or slouching on the couch can place unnecessary strain on the muscles in the lower back. It is important to maintain good posture throughout the day to prevent and manage lower back pain. When seated, keep your feet flat on the ground, your back straight, and your shoulders relaxed. If you work at a desk, consider using a standing desk or an ergonomic chair that offers proper support for your lower back. 3. Hot/Cold Therapy Heat and cold therapy are effective ways to manage lower back pain. A heating pad or warm bath can help to relax tight muscles and increase blood flow to the affected area. Cold therapy, in the form of an ice pack or cold compress, can help to reduce inflammation and numb the area, which can provide relief for acute pain. 4. Stretching Stretching is an effective way to relieve tension in the muscles of the lower back. Some of the best stretches for lower back pain include the knee-to-chest stretch, the supine hamstring stretch, and the cat-cow stretch. It is important to stretch gently and avoid over-stretching, which can cause further injury. 5. Massage Therapy Massage therapy can be an effective way to manage lower back pain. A skilled massage therapist can provide targeted therapy that can alleviate tension and relieve pain. Deep tissue massage, trigger point therapy, and myofascial release are all effective techniques for managing lower back pain. 6. Over-the-counter Medications Over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can help to relieve lower back pain. It is important to follow the recommended dosage and to avoid using these medications for extended periods of time. Consult a physician before taking any medication. 7. Chiropractic Treatment Chiropractic treatment involves manually adjusting the spine to alleviate tension and reduce pressure on the nerves in the lower back. Chiropractors use a series of gentle manipulation techniques to help relieve pain and restore proper alignment to the spine. Conclusion Lower back pain can be a frustrating and debilitating condition, but there are a number of effective ways to manage the pain and prevent future injuries. Regular exercise, improving posture, hot/cold therapy, stretching, massage therapy, over-the-counter medications, and chiropractic treatment are all effective options for relieving lower back pain. It is important to consult a physician before beginning any new treatment regimen, especially if you have chronic pain or a pre-existing condition. With the right treatment, you can get back to a pain-free life and enjoy all the activities you love."},{"instruction":"What is the function of an SAP FICO consultant?","output":"An SAP FICO consultant is a specialized professional who is well-versed in the SAP ERP system.

No, of course not. Within a relatively short period of time, it will become clear to both House and Senate Republicans that crafting a deal with the Democrats that will override Trump veto is more important than standing by the President is. They will do so to avoid the wrath of their constituents, especially when the shutdown starts to threaten payment for government benefits or slows down the processing of income tax returns. This may already be happening because fewer Republicans are openly backing Trump when claims that the wall/barrier is the only solution. If the GOP was afraid that their base would abandon them in the past, they are even more afraid that the “swing voters” who they need in many areas to win, decide to abandon them due to the shutdown. Without those voters, tough races will become out of reach for some candidates. The shutdown will end within the next few weeks (as of 10 January 2019) because it’s threatening to harm taxpayers, personally and the economy, overall.

Analysts in investment banks, even when they are focused on a particular industry, have no clue what the drivers of the industry are - they only know the drivers they are told were important in the past, but not those that will become important tomorrow. M&A lawyers know what's been done, but just because they say something cannot be done doesn't mean it can't - they just haven't seen it done yet. A true insight and invention are extremely rare, and when one comes up with a new, interesting idea, they will face a brick wall of everyone else who are following the trend, know the jargon, and give every impression they are far more knowledgeable than you. Treating everything in a way where you keep asking questions until you are sure you understood the fundamentals or forced your counterparty to admit they are not sure about an answer has been the best policy I could've developed so far. There is no shame in asking, ever. You pay your bankers, lawyers and traders for answering your questions about the job they're paid to do. They are paid from your fees. And when they don't know, ask someone else, or read the book yourself. In short - only invest into things you really understand. And be open about the things you don't fully understand - to yourself and people who ask you. Don't go around, speaking the words and hoping not to be found out - that's what sales people do."},{"instruction":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","output":"Wow. Reading some of the answers on here from my Quoran sisters has made me pretty sad and angry. What I’m about to write in my answer seems nowhere near as bad. Nobody has sent me any messages or stalked me on other social media. The main harassment I have experienced on Quora has been in the comments sections of my answers and in response to comments that I make on other answers. When I first started writing answers on Quora, I usually wrote answers to questions related to interracial dating as an Asian woman, experiences growing up with Asian parents, overseas Chinese and other things related to Chinese people or culture. I answer mainly from personal experience, and my experiences are not appreciated by everyone, as to be expected. I found that the rudest comments I ever received were from Asian males who were unhappy with some of the content of my answers. One guy made fake accounts in order to post comments on some of my answers about how I must “turn people off with my flat face” and how “white guys only go for [me] because [I’m] easy,” and how, “[my] children will look Asian, and nobody will accept them.” (Jokes on him, I don’t have any children, and I’m never going to.) I found out who the fake accounts were because one of the fake accounts was linked to the guy’s Facebook page that featured his real name. I had seen this Quoran post answers to questions that appeared on my feed before. He seemed like a well-followed and prolific writer on the subject of the Asian-American male experience. I reported the fake accounts and his real account, and I muted and blocked all of the accounts I knew to be associated with this guy. I don’t know what action (if any) was taken on it by Quora moderation. Not many people comment on my answers, but I’ve noticed that when I get a negative or overly critical comment from another user, it is almost always a user with a male-sounding name. The comment is usually very patronising and seeks to point out how wrong I am in either some small thing or everything that I have written. Sometimes, the dude just reads too much into my answer and tries to tell me how to change my tone so as not to sound like such a bitch. (They don’t write that, that’s just what I’m reading into it :P) When I look at the profiles of who is making these types of comments, it usually turns out to be older males from a more conservative country or viewpoint. I think the patronising comments and the trolling have been a minority though. Most male and male-sounding users I have interacted with on Quora have been cool. They’re not all skeezy creepers."},{"instruction":"What will happen to the twin flame runner if he does not do the inner healing work?","output":"Ok, I am not “per se\\" Runner… though it's just labels… First of, the person needs to be awake to the connection 😊 Then, they are a pair… the souls influence each other, so it's being said when one starts working on themselves, the other does too (there might be a delay though)… Also… what I have seen in my own experience… The journey itself pushes you… and I mean sometimes quite strongly… THE JOURNEY makes sure you work on yourself, to become your authentic version, to get rid of things that doesn't make you happy.

I cried and I hoped I could at least manage till after the divorce is officially over… you know, to not have too many things on my plate… No… the Universe didn't allow me that time… Some friends started leaving, my beloved fitness down in the building got closed… the signs were pushing and pushing for me to get out of my comfort zone and leave the corporate. Immediately! Not in a half year or so… When it reached the point of me seeing leadership playing with numbers (showing statistics in a different way to show a different more pleasantly looking story)… and one control recheck morning seeing how messy people are and not caring at all about private/proprietary things… I just couldn't anymore… That was my line… I couldn't stay any longer in the corporate… I resigned… In the middle of awaiting divorce, not yet having settled any money for the kids with their father… not having any next job lined up… Yet I had to… With the believe that I would be taken care of 🙏 And I was taken care of ❤️ The moment I finally left the company (2 months leaving notice) was time to submit the divorce, the father started paying for the kids, paying me out of the house, and the state is supporting financially partially for a few months too people without job. It's 10 months so far and I still am not back to “work”… no longer state support, yet the other parts and my extra income when I am careful are enough to live happily… I already am in the process of now really more openly looking for a job. Yet with how things work I know I shouldn't press too much, the right thing will come in it's due time… I believe the Universe will settle the things for me ❤️ See? I was “running from the need to leave my job\\"… and the Universe was so pushing, that after a few tries it found the limit where I couldn't “not leave\\" anymore… So don't you worry, if the journey plans something, it will get very pushy for a person to do it… if still running and not acknowledging, you start loosing things… in a way it will reach your limit and push you to do what is needed — which usually does contain the “inner healing” in itself too. And eventhou only spiritually and intuitively knowing 😊 I know my own Dear One, himself rather a “runner\\", could share several stories about how he got pushed to do some things 😊 Even the “runner” will do their work, they just usually take longer time in doing so… which is a neverending lesson in patience for us “chasers\\" 😊 Bless you on your journey ❤️"},{"instruction":"Which are the best over ear Bluetooth headphones under ₹5000?","output":"GoodComfortable, good passive noise isolationUSB Type-C, fast chargingDolby Atmos, AAC Bluetooth codec supportEnjoyable soundExcellent value for moneyBadSome features need a OnePlus smartphone to workLimited controls on the earpieces Headphone TypeIn-Ear MicrophoneYes ConnectivityTrue Wireless Stereo (TWS) TypeEarphones Amazing deal for you!

Americans should pay at least a trillion dollars in reparations, which could be used to improve the economy in numerous ways. By taking away the constant threat of war and regime change by the American imperialists, the pressure would also be taken off of the government, allowing them to spend less on the military and relax their security measures. It is not possible to understand problems in DPRK without acknowledging the generations of violence and deprivation which Americans have imposed on them. It is in particular not possible to fully understand why they prioritized the nuclear program without noting how Gaddafi and others were killed in American interventions after agreeing not to develop a nuclear deterrent.

[LINKED_TEXT: Taking a closer look at LHC] [URL: https://www.lhc-closer.es/taking_a_closer_look_at_lhc/0.magnetic_dipoles] . For a given magnetic field strength of an accelerator its radius is proportional to the required maximum beam particles energy. In the project of the Future Cirular Collider (replacing the LHC) it is forseen to have twice stronger bending magnets (about 16 Tesla) and almost 4 times larger radius which should allow to accelerate protons up to 50 TeV energy (1.93*3.70*7 TeV= 50.0 TeV).

IKE was mostly on the golf course or in a hospital with a heart attack. He really wasn’t president, just a figurehead using the White House as a retirement home. During IKE’s “presidency” Sherman Adams ran domestic affairs and John Foster Dulles did foreign affairs. IKE ran the country like he did the military, sitting in the rear doing nothing, delegating and letting others do the jobs that he took credit for. IKE chose NIxon to balance the ticket, to keep conservatives from deserting IKE’s more “moderate” or liberal politics. It worked.

Pomodoro Technique: This technique involves breaking your work into focused intervals of typically 25 minutes, known as \\"pomodoros,\\" followed by short breaks. After completing four pomodoros, take a longer break. This method helps maintain focus and avoid burnout. 2. Power Naps: Short power naps of around 15-20 minutes can provide a quick burst of rejuvenation and increase alertness. Find a quiet space, set an alarm, and allow yourself a brief rest to recharge and enhance productivity. 3. The Two-Minute Rule: If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately. This rule prevents small tasks from piling up and saves time in the long run. 4. Habit Stacking: Pair a new habit you want to develop with an existing one. For example, if you want to incorporate reading into your routine, you could read for 15 minutes after brushing your teeth in the morning. Habit stacking leverages existing habits to make new habits easier to adopt. 5. The Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance: Do First (urgent and important), Schedule (important but not urgent), Delegate (urgent but not important), and Eliminate (neither urgent nor important). This method helps you focus on high-priority tasks. 6. Single-Tasking: Instead of multitasking, focus on one task at a time. Research shows that multitasking can decrease productivity and increase errors. By giving your full attention to a single task, you can complete it more efficiently and effectively. 7. Environment Optimization: Create a productive work environment by minimizing distractions and optimizing your workspace. Eliminate clutter, personalize your space, use noise-cancelling headphones, or explore ambient background noise apps to create an atmosphere conducive to concentration. 8. Digital Detox: Schedule regular breaks from digital devices and social media. Set specific time periods when you disconnect to reduce distractions, improve focus, and recharge your mental energy. 9. Mind Mapping: Use visual mind maps to organize and brainstorm ideas. Mind mapping allows you to visually connect concepts and generate creative solutions, enhancing productivity and clarity of thought. 10. Regular Physical Activity: Incorporate regular physical exercise into your routine. Exercise improves blood flow, enhances mood, reduces stress, and boosts cognitive function—all of which contribute to increased productivity. Remember, productivity techniques can vary in effectiveness depending on individual preferences and work styles. Experiment with different strategies to find what works best for you, and adapt them to suit your specific needs and circumstances."},{"instruction":"What is your worst cinema experience?","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or emotions.

All you need to do is make your pick wisely. ICELAND Most people assume that Iceland is expensive. But what they don’t realise is that if backpacking is adapted as a norm, travel costs are significantly reduced for an Indian traveller. MOLDOVA Moldova is unheard of by most Indian travellers despite being an extremely beautiful European country. Not to forget, super cheap. If you can book flights on time, you can reduce your average trip cost. HUNGARY One of my first most affordable international trips was to Hungary. Ever since I’ve advocated for more and more people to travel to this wonderful European nation. BHUTAN What can be better than a country so close to India, so safe and so cheap? Bhutan is one of the cheapest countries to travel from India. PHILIPPINES Philippines lies in the Indian ocean and is a vast treasure house of pretty locales. If you can keep a tab on discounts offered by SkyScanner and Air Asia, you’ll end up saving a lot of money. MACEDONIA Located in the Balkan peninsula, Macedonia is a gorgeous European nation. If you can earn a decent amount of credit miles on flights, travelling to Macedonia can actually be the cheapest in Europe. CHILE Chile is one South American nation that you would want to visit again and again. I cannot even begin to describe its magnificence. Chile as a nation is very affordable. The only thing to watch out for is flight costs. BENIN Anybody visiting Togo should certainly visit Benin. They lie back to back in Western Africa. The terrain is more or less the same and so are the travel costs. MALAWI Malawi is safe, cheap, and fun for Indian travellers. The people here are hospitable and welcoming. It’s sad that not many Indians keep Malawi on their travel bucket list. SERBIA Serbia is quite an underrated travel destination. I highly insist that more Indian travellers should visit it. It’s a lovely nation with warm and welcoming people. VIETNAM Vietnam is one of the best South East Asian countries to take a backpacking trip. This includes solo travel for both men and women. This region is one of the cheapest countries to travel from India. MYANMAR As an Indian, you are allowed to travel to Myanmar via road. This is possible through Manipur’s capital city – Imphal. In order to reach Imphal, either travel from Guwahati (Assam’s capital) by plane or even by train. KAZAKHSTAN For Indian travellers, a trip to Kazakhstan will prove to be super cheap if you club it along with Uzbekistan. That way, you spend on flights just one time and from can travel to Kazakhstan by train. It’s strange but must see the region. It’s actually a mix of super developed cities that have become business hubs and weird deserted places.

This mistake can cost you heavily in your preparation. Before starting your preparation you should be well aware of the exam pattern, marks distribution and blue print of the subjects. Pick up previous 10 years papers and analyze which subjects/topics are of most importance.Lacking in planning: Students often fail to plan their studies and start covering the syllabus randomly. You should always have a plan and a time-table to execute the plan. Studying with a proper planning will ensure that you are on the right track and always assign deadlines to the goals.Studying deeply a subject that has less weight age: I’ve often seen students preparing a subject that they like in depth even though it might be having very less weight age in examination. A subject should be given priority according to the weight age. There is no point of having enormous amount of knowledge about a subject which carries 2–4 Marks weight age and having a little or no knowledge about a subject having 7–8 Marks of weight age. This should be kept in mind while making your plan.Being over/under confident in your preparations: Many students makes this mistake of being over/under confident in your preparations. Understand the fact that your B.Tech marks does not matter here. You topped the university— “good for you”, now don’t feel that GATE is going to be “piece of cake” for you. Believe me it is going to test your real knowledge about the subjects. Similarly even if you have scored in 60’s in your B.Tech, don’t be under confident, This exam is going to treat every one equally and at the end of the day your knowledge is going to matter. Remember “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t works hard”.Ignoring your Health: Students at times tend to ignore the most important aspect of a preparation and that is health. I’ve always said that the preparation should be a healthy one. There is no point of achieving a feat if you are unable to celebrate it. So while preparation make sure that you remain healthy and fit. Eat healthy, sleep properly and exercise daily. These are some common mistakes that should be avoided while preparing for GATE .

So Heraclitus famously said that you never step into the same river twice. This leads to the distinction between form and matter. Matter distinguishes.things from each other. So you could have two identical triangles made of the same material which are different because they are two different pieces of matter. If the form of the triangle was imagined apart from the matter, that is to say it was just a definition, then there couldn't be two different triangles with the same length of sides and the same angles. As regards the specific question about Theseus' ship, one way of answering it would be based on what you are looking for. If you wanted to know what the original ship looked like, then the reconstructed ship would be better. It has the same form. If the Ship had been allowed to decay, then what you would see would be less like the original ship but would have more of the same matter."},{"instruction":"w can I get a call history of any number?","output":"I nend call history"},{"instruction":"What are some examples of your pets showing altruistic behavior?","output":"besides keeping me from dwelling on my depression and saving me from suicide physically (multiple times) my dogs re natural parents to my various rescue and foster animals.

However, there are harmonies of the gospel where portions are not repeated as they are in the Synoptic Gospels; Matthew, Mark and Luke. <> John has some events in common with the other three but, in the main it is about John’s close encounters with Jesus and proving Him to be the Son of God so that we might believe and have life in His Name.

His power levels since meeting the Beyonder became utterly ridiculous. Franklin Richards is really the only other (human) being who can come close. And, to be honest, I think I’d place him just above Frank. EDIT: I almost forgot.

General Rawat, while emphasizing on the closed historical ties between India and Nepal remarked that Nepal is free to follow her own independent policy in international affairs, but she should be vigilant and should learn from Sri Lanka and other countries which have signed agreement with other nations in the region. General Rawat indirectly referred to the China-Sri Lanka engagement under which China invested huge money in Sri Lanka in the form of loans. When Sri Lanka was not able to repay the loan in time, Sri Lanka signed agreement with China in 2017 to hand over her Hambantota port to China on 99 year lease, Thus China[s investment and BRI proved to be land grabbing tactics in neighbouring countries. Image Courtesy: 2020 General Rawat wanted Nepal to remember this episode while signing similar deal with China. Nepal is due to sign a huge infrastructure deal for Chinese investment in road and rail connectivity projects in Nepal. If Nepal does not head to Genera Rawat’s advice, it may soon find herself trapped in the land grabbing debt trap of China. China has done similar deals in Maldives also. Even China’s all weather friend Pakistan is also going to be the next victim of China’s land grabbing economic diplomacy. Pakistan has already given Gwadar port to China on 40 year lease and China is increasing her footprints in Gilgit-Baltistan and other Islands of Pakistan.

This is what I said when any sibling fighting was going on. One time it was snowing heavily and I watched from a window my 2 kids talking on the porch. After about 5 minutes, I opened the door and asked if they were ready to come in. My son said, “mom, it’s cold outside. We could have frozen to death!”. I responded “ Best check the weather before you disrupt the harmony of my home with your fighting”.Told my kids if they asked to have a friend over in front of the friend the answer was an automatic “no”. The request needed to be done in private out of respect for the friend and to thwart manipulative behavior.When my daughter was 13 she let it be known that she didn’t want to eat dinner with the family. Her desire was to eat later and to eat something different than what was cooked. After I could see this wasn’t a once in a while thing I would say “come sit with us, we really just want your company”. Which was true as most school information came out in conversation at dinner time. She would sit and be pouty watching us eat. About an hour after dinner she’d say “ I’m going to fix myself something to eat. I would say “ok, I’ll sit with you and keep you company”. And again with the pouty face as we sat together at the table. This lasted about 2 weeks.and then she went back to having dinner with us and eating what was served.we had to drive 30 miles about 2 times a month to grocery shop, clothes shop, doctor appts. etc. while grocery shopping, I would instruct them to go get an item(they’d go together) with my instructions as to what to look for in terms of comparison( price, size). I accepted whatever they brought back. For some reason all 3 of them have fond memories of this! Go figure!When the kids started voicing their desires for specific foods for dinner( this started at about age 11) I gave them the opportunity to plan one meal a week and help with preparation. I’m not sure if this contributed to all 3 being much better cooks than I ever was!during “play dates” at our house ALL toys out were to be shared. If my kid had a special toy that he/she didn’t want to share it was put away and not accessible.We didn’t eat out very much but we never made a waiter/waitress stand and listen to a small child tell her/him what their choice in the menu was. THAT was decided before the waitress came to take the order. Once the choice was made the child could state it but there was none of that(back & forth do you want pickles, tomatoes, fries or onion rings thing while the waitress stood and waited) . (Ex-waitress here).When they were toddlers when they fell and would start to cry, and I could tell there was little to no injury I would hug the kid and ask “ was that a binka binka or a bonka bonka.?” Kid always stopped crying to consider the question.these aren’t all “silly” but they were effective in encouraging specific desired behavior without the constant talking AT the kids without the nagging"},{"instruction":"Donovan Mitchell the shortest player in the history of the NBA to score 70 points?","output":"Yes."},{"instruction":"Atheists, take a look around.

Our goals may be totally unrealistic when we consider our current level of fitness. All too frequently, we've made the same silly mistakes for months or years without taking someone's advice or simply listening to our own bodies for clues. If you have felt stuck, slowed, or even in reverse with your fitness routine, read on! If you are one who has been slowed by a nagging injury, listen up! If you're not listening to your body when it tells you it hurts; you're doing yourself a big disservice. A reoccurring popping or clicking sound can be totally free of pain. In such instances, it may never lead to anything more serious than an irritating noise. Although in several cases, it can be a precursor to more serious injuries such as tendonitis, bursitis, and even long-term ailments such as arthritis. It's always a good idea to have a medical professional evaluate reoccurring sounds, also known as \\"crepitations.\\" What about a muscle pull that just won't heal? A \\"pull\\" is actually a small tear in the muscle fiber. When you continually stress the muscle through your exercise program it doesn't get time to mend itself. The word \\"strain\\" is commonly used for a muscle or tendon injury, while \\"sprain\\" applies to a ligament. In either case, rest, hot or cold packs, and massage therapy will help.

In fact, I do not even believe that most ENFPs are popular in this way, but rather, they are simply “well-liked”—most people have a positive opinion even if they do not hang much with us. Let me explain: ENFPs are not likely to be popular in the traditional sense due to Ne hero, the vast majority of folks are SJs and they DO NOT LIKE Ne hero. In fact, most ENFPs are considered too eccentric to hang with the “in-crowd”, and frankly, not a lot of us care that much. You would be shocked how many of us experience bullying on the regular, and it is usually due to Ne-Fi. ENTPs would be more popular (but generally, not to the extent of SPs or SJs), probably because of Fe child, but again, Ne hurts them with the majority of people.

The short answer to this question is to get organized. Early. Meal Prep: Have a schedule for grocery shopping and cooking. There aren't a ton of options for food on campus. Most of them are overpriced for the portions you're receiving and you would be surprised how quickly costs add up.Give yourself enough time: The standard ratio for lecture vs. Study time is 1:3. For every hour of lecture, give yourself an average of 3 hours to read and do homework for that class.Make summaries of your notes & lecture notes per week. This will make your life easier when it's time to study for exams.Seek Out & Take Advantage of ALL opportunities and resources on campus. There are so many untapped resources at the University for employment, mentorship, financial aid, study skills, housing- both on and off campus, etc. Talk to your registrar and go to the Koffler House on College & St.George and inqure. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed there is someone to help you.Use the gyms at UofT. They're some of the best and most equipped gyms in the city. UofT has drop-in & paid classes if using gym equipment isn't your cup of tea. Exercise relieves stress, keeps you fit and should be worked into your schedule at least 3 times a week.UofT students get UNLIMITED Physiotherapy per school year. For only 80. It's located at the Goldring Centre. Located at Bloor & Devonshire.Do the utmost to stay on top of your work. This is self explanatory but work piles up quickly and falling behind is deadly.Develop a working relationship with an academic advisor, your registrar and your professors. Go to office hours as much as possible. Even if you don't have tons of questions. Developing a good relationship with Professors is invaluable. If you need extensions on assignments, reccomendations on classes for the following year, networking opportunities, ways to get involved with classes your interested in, etc., your professor is a great resource and person to talk to.If you commute, use that time to read or review for class.Book Study Rooms in advance. Good group rooms book up quickly. Make a point to scout out rooms a few weeks in advance and then book. These are things that are less obvious. Most people don't know about or do these little things that make all the difference throughout the year.

However, while tempered glass is more robust, it is not completely unbreakable. Tempered glass is designed to shatter into small, relatively harmless pieces when it does break. This is a safety feature to minimize the risk of injury from sharp shards. While it is less likely to break from everyday use or minor impacts, it can still break under certain conditions. Factors that can cause tempered glass to break include: Strong and concentrated impacts: A forceful impact, particularly at the edges or corners of the glass, can cause it to break.Scratches or chips: If tempered glass has scratches or chips, it can weaken the overall structure and make it more prone to breaking.Extreme temperature changes: Rapid and extreme temperature fluctuations can cause tempered glass to break. For example, pouring hot water on a cold glass surface or exposing it to a sudden blast of cold air can create stress and lead to breakage.Manufacturing defects or flaws: Although rare, defects or flaws in the manufacturing process can compromise the integrity of tempered glass and make it more susceptible to breaking. While tempered glass is generally more durable than regular glass, it's still important to handle it with care.

Sprint planning is done by the Scrum team. The product owner tells the team how a product increases the value and utility in a particular sprint. Then the Scrum team set a Sprint goal and made a particular decision to meet the Sprint goal. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning. Developers then discuss with the Product owner and the scrum team and select some items from the Product backlog to include in the current sprint. The scrum team then includes or excludes the Products chosen by the developers for better understanding. The developer divides the Product backlog items into smaller work for better understanding, and only they could choose how they want to work on the particular product that has to be done in the sprint. The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the particular Sprint, and the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

Normally names will be approved by Honours Committees, but knighthoods of the Royal Victorian Order are in his personal gift and he can knight anyone he wants as a KCVO or GCVO. He can knight any subject. So they don’t have to be British, they can be citizens of any of the 14 other countries where he is also king. If anyone is not a subject, they can still be given an honorary knighthood, which means they can’t be “Sir”. This will normally be a KBE or GBE in the Order of the British Empire, so they’ll still have the letters even though they can’t use “”Sir”. This is often given to American presidents. The female equivalent is Dame and an example of that is Angelina Jolie DCMG. Which brings me to the story of the late Sir Terry Wogan. “El Tel” was Irish but had been working on British TV and radio for many years. You name it, he presented it, including British coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest for what seemed like forever. It was hardly surprising that the Honours Committee got round to considering him and it recommended an honorary KBE for services to broadcasting. Honorary because he’d never become British. Under the special arrangements put in place when the Republic of Ireland got independence, Irish citizens have always been able to freely live and work in the UK, and even vote, so he’d never bothered. But now it was getting in the way of being Sir Terry. He applied for British naturalisation, it was fast-tracked (he’d been in the UK so long he obviously qualified) and so the honour could be upgraded to full Sir-dom."},{"instruction":"Do autopilot systems in some way diminish the natural skills and reflexes of pilots?","output":"Not in my opinion. Hand-flying can be taxing and an autopilot can free up a pilot to pay attention to other important flight operations. Most, if not all landings are done without autopilot assistance. Skills & reflexes must be maintained at a high level to safely land manually. I'm more concerned with pilots these days who bypass navigation skills because of being guided by GPS. A good pilot will be confirming their position by GPS, not blindly following it. Solid map, watch & compass skills will always be valuable and there's much less to go wrong. When a GPS fails (it's happened several times to me) the question becomes how quickly can the pilot revert to a paper map.

So doctors are not put off by someone coming in with concerns. They would rather check out a sprained wrist then have a patient become permanently disabled because it was broken. I see my doctor for an annual physical, and three or four other visits to renew my prescriptions. So I normally see my doctor four or five times a year. Then add on concern visits. There might be one or two other visits throughout the year. Bad falls, unusual lumps. (I found a lump during my morning shower, had an appointment within a half-hour, an ultra-sound 45 minutes later and test results back that it was non-cancerous before noon. Oh those terrible long lines for healthcare in Canada that Americans fret about.) Now there are some people who do visit the doctor very frequent, maybe a couple times a month. Some times this is because they are prescription shopping - getting opioid prescriptions for none existing issues. Most doctors will refer them to addiction counselling. For others it is an underlying mental issue such as hypochondriac. The milder cases are treated with placebos. More serious cases are referred to mental health services. My doctor once had a elderly patient who came in every day. He explained that they were simply lonely. He supply mental health care just by talking to them for a few minutes every day. He explained he rarely billed the system for them because he enjoyed their visits. So while he saw the patient 20+ times a month he only build 2 or 3 times because he was doing his job. - providing a form of healthcare."},{"instruction":"Who is a better Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi or Manmohan Singh?","output":"1 ) Manmohan Singh ji Manmohan Singh ji is one of the well educated and cleared image personality of politics .

Reason — Forcing pure veg diet on the cat My father had a colleague who is his close friend and our families frequently visit each other and often go on trips. Their family consists of a husband, a wife, an elder daughter and a younger son. Both children are my good friends. They were living in a flat in an apartment complex in Pune. When we were in school, they bought a kitten. I don't have much knowledge about different breeds of cat, but I know that it belonged to a fancy glamorous breed, because the kitten was bought for Rs 20k, which was a substantial part of husband's monthly salary at that time (2003–04). It was white coloured with copper colour stripes. The family was following very strict vegitarian diet. Eating meat, fish, eggs etc. was a big taboo for them. The problem was they forced this diet on the poor kitten. Initially there was no problem, when the kitten was small. Because they were feeding milk which was sufficient for the kitten. Gradually problem started, as the kitten began to grow. It used to go mad whenever smell of non veg used to come from neighbouring flats. It was becoming very difficult for them to restrain it, as it was growing stronger and more agile day by day. They were consistantly providing milk and roti (Indian wheat bread). But I guess that was not fulfilling the protein requirements. The cat was regularly eating cockroaches, spiders etc. The cat disliked roti for sure, but it used to eat it whenever it was unable to control hunger. The cat abandoned the family when it was approx one year old. One day it jumped out of balcony to a neighbour's chajja and then to a balcony below and so on towards ground. The helpless wife and daughter watched, as the cat walked away with swag, never to be seen again."},{"instruction":"What is the Ship of Theseus paradox?","output":"This isn’t actually a problem, so there is no solution. The Ship of Theseus is a ‘thought experiment’ rather than a problem. It’s meant to discuss the concepts of identity. Is a ‘thing’ a thing because of its physical make-up? Is it simply the physical components? What if we replace those components? It is still that thing? Or did it cease being a thing when a single piece of it is replaced? If replacing one piece is okay, why not two? Or three? Or ten? At what point does the thing stop being ‘that thing’? The experiment is meant to provoke thought, and make you question ideas. It is not meant to have a clear cut solution, because it’s not actually a problem, but an examination of the way in which we view identity. And through this, you have to question what criteria we use to classify identities, as this experiment is really meant to be a simplistic analogue to human identities, which is obviously significantly more complex. Am I the same person I was 10 years ago, even if basically every cell in my body has been discarded and replaced? Am I the same person, even if I hold different beliefs and experiences than the person from a decade ago? What makes a person who they are? How do we deal with the transference of identity?

Nearly half the world lives at risk of the disease, said the World Health Organization, which made the estimate. Depending on where you live, mosquitoes may range from an itch-inducing annoyance to a constant threat. That’s led scientists to ask: What if we killed them all?

The Anopheles gambiae carries malaria, for example. The Aedes aegypti came to the U.S. aboard slave ships, spreading yellow fever and, as seen last year, Zika. So we need not end all mosquitoes to reduce mosquito-related deaths, as Cameron Webb, an etymologist at the University of Sydney, [LINKED_TEXT: told ] [URL: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/why-eradicating-earths-mosquitoes-to-fight-disease-is-probably-a-bad-idea][LINKED_TEXT: Motherboard] [URL: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/why-eradicating-earths-mosquitoes-to-fight-disease-is-probably-a-bad-idea][LINKED_TEXT: last year] [URL: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/why-eradicating-earths-mosquitoes-to-fight-disease-is-probably-a-bad-idea].

Other insects could flourish in their place, and it seems most species would find alternatives to eat. And while mosquitoes do help pollinate thousands of plants, Janet McAllister, an entomologist with the Centers for Disease Control, told Nature that mosquito pollination isn’t critical to any plants humans rely on. Phil Lounibos, a University of Florida entomologist, has said that whatever insect rises up to replace mosquitoes could prove “equally, or more, undesirable from a public health viewpoint,” as he told BBC last year. Science writer David Quammen has suggested that mosquitoes protected tropical rainforests in which they thrive, keeping human beings —and deforestation—at bay. Inevitably, the absence of mosquitoes would shift our ecosystems. But would those shifts be drastic or long lasting? Again, we don’t know for sure. Ecosystems are complex, and experts disagree. Hundreds of thousands of children would be saved One drastic change we would see: Hundreds of thousands would not die malaria each year, most of which being children under five. Add to that the reduction of roughly 55,000 annual deaths reducible from dengue fever or yellow fever, for which the Aedes aegypti is the main carrier.

Now divorce is even not a solution since in that case his salary which is alrady less will be further divided and you need lawyer fees too and that will be very difficult for you and your kids to handle. You have no option but to bear everything in silence since you have closed all gates of your happiness. Now back to present this isn't a super hypothetical situation instead it is preety common. You might have seen this all around you women being housewife without finiancial stability and husbands sometimes abusive(not all). For them there is no way out. This this is my point that you must focus on studies rather than chilling with friends and boyfriend it is good if you make a good balance. Finiancial independency should be a must criteria for girls. The norm that your husband will earn what is the need for you to work should be changed. Both the partners if possible should earn or at least have enough education such that if need arises they could get a well paying job. His money will be his it can never be yours thats a fact. When you have finiances you can take care of you and your family. You can contribute in the finiances of your house. The feeling of the responsibility brings a lot of happiness. My best advice is for you is to study or do anything which will gives you finiancial security in the future and this should be your top priority.

Cold emailing is when you send a pitch to a company that you're not already connected with. The best way to start is by finding a list of companies that you want to work for. You can find this list by doing a Google search for \\"content writing jobs.\\" Once you have a list of companies, research each one and find the email addresses of the people in charge of hiring. Then, it's time to write your pitch. Your pitch should be short and sweet, and it should include the following: -Why you're interested in working for the company? -What skills do you have that make you a good fit for the job? -Why you're the best candidate for the job? Once you've written your pitch, send it to the email addresses of the people in charge of hiring. Be sure to follow up with them if you don't hear back. **Freelancing Platforms** If you're looking for some extra work to help pay the bills, freelancing platforms can be a great way to get content writing assignments. These websites connect writers with businesses who need content for their websites, blogs, or other projects. There are a number of different freelancing platforms out there, but some of the most popular ones include Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr. Each platform has its own set of rules and procedures, so be sure to read up on the specifics before you start bidding for jobs. The great thing about freelancing platforms is that they provide a lot of opportunities for writers of all experience levels. You can find projects that are a good fit for your skills and experience, and you can also build your portfolio by completing a variety of different assignments. If you're just starting out as a writer, freelancing platforms can be a great way to get your foot in the door. You'll get to work with some great businesses and learn new skills along the way. And who knows – you might even find your next long-term freelance gig through one of these platforms!

I was Marketing Director of Dr Solomon’s Software - leading UK producer of antivirus software. Our biggest competitor was McAfee - now part of Intel.

McAfee discovered this, and issued a press release claiming that Dr Solomon’s used “cheat mode” to improve our results in independent tests. Our response was a press release, the title of which I wrote: “McAfee pleads with Dr Solomon’s to reduce virus detection rate!” This achieved front-page coverage in almost every computer and IT security publication in Europe and the USA. When, some time later, McAfee (by then renamed Network Associates) acquired Dr Solomon’s, the first question the acquisition team asked when they walked through the door was, “who wrote that press release?”.

Like most things, expectation and experience are two very different things. Overall, we noted many good qualities that aren't talked about very often and some general cultural oddities that we weren't expecting. First for the good - both expected and unexpected Strong family values. Most Americans and Europeans in general don't value the family as much as they used to. Wealth in general seems to do that to a culture. In India, however, the family is center to everything. Men and women have very traditional roles. Extended families are very important, and arrianged marriages are extremely successful. Few in the U.S. know that India has a 99% success rate for marriages (meaning that they don't end in divorce).Indians are extremely helpful. Only once in our whole time in India did someone refuse to help us, and that was near a train station in Mumbai, so they very legitimately could have been busy. We were floored by the rejection because we were so used to everyone being so helpful. A desire to learn. Every Indian I have met values education, even if they did not complete all of their schooling. India's tech center has to do with their strong desire for education and one of the reasons why so many Indians come to the U.S. is because they can't get the education they want in India. General respect for people and animals. You never see kids screaming, shouting, or making a scene. The culture overall is very reserved and respectful.This isn't necessarily one of the things about Indians, but one of the things I loved wherever we went was the rickshaws. I think they are an incredibly creative and fun way to get around. I think it's cool that they are different colors in different parts of the country. In Delhi, they're green, in Andhra Pradesh they are yellow, and on the Western coast (Mumbai) they are black. Now for the initial peculiarities for a Westerner The disregard for the environment. We took a boat trip down the Godavari River and everyone threw their trash in the river, and the people in India believe the rivers contain the divinity of gods! To me it seemed as if everyone was grafitiing a church. Their explanation is that the river goddess would take care of it. Overall my experience in India was not as dirty as I expected, but it is still an issue that I think prevents the general Western tourist from visiting India. The general lack of knowledge from Indian Hindus about Hinduism. The religion is extremely eclectic, but we were confused at first to find that nobody - even the priests - could often answer questions about why things are the way they are in the religion. It took a while to let go of my notions of religion to grasp how Hinduism is such an accepting culture. And the acceptance comes without the \\"why\\" questions. Which leads partially into #3The people in general just seemed to go with the flow. Education in schools was very behaviorist. People worked in their jobs because their parents did. Religious rituals were performed because \\"that's what the book says.\\" This was so striking to us as Americans because part of our core values is to stick it to the man - something that's probably been there from Protestantism (where protest is at the heart of it). One of the things I loved at first and then grew to loathe was that everyone wanted a picture with us because we were white. I think that is due to the fact that there aren't many white-skinned tourists compared to the population in India, so we were different for most people we came into contact with. I appreciated the few times when people would approach me and talk for a while before requesting a picture. It felt more like I made a friend rather than that famous person you only want to put on Facebook to show your friends. Here are some pictures from our trip. For anyone thinking of going to India, just go! It is one of the safest, cheapest, and exhilarating experiences anyone could have. I loved it, especially when we were traveling. After going to India, I feel like I can connect with my Indian coworkers. They have such an amazing culture that they don't often share because part of the culture is to be reserved and respectful. If you are an American and work with someone from India, ask them about it, and keep an open mind. As humans we associate different with bad, yet the only reason is because it is unfamilar. Learning about Indian culture will make you more accepting, loving, creative, and appreciative. Going to India, in short, made the strange familiar and the familiar strange."},{"instruction":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","output":"It’s mainly to do with their lifestyle. Cats that are solitary hunters only need to feed themselves. Being larger allows them to store some of that energy as fat, for the days when prey are sparse. Dogs are pack animals that hunt as a group, and this means that the prey animal must feed ALL of them. If the hunter animals get bigger than about 150lb, then you’d need several prey animals per day. Most packs include, on average, about six wolves. Females weigh 60-100lb, and males are 70-145lb, which means the pack is 390-735lb as a group. The largest tigers are about 650lb (sorry the weights are in pounds, those are the ones I found on Google). As you can see, there’s an upper limit to the amount of prey animals you can find in woodland :)"},{"instruction":"What is the best way to start learning PHP?","output":"As far as the first part of your question is concerned(Path); Web Development has 3 divisions, each a world & profession in itself :- Front-end : Deals with client-side/user interface(things functioning in your web browser).Back-end : Deals with server-side functioning, data storing & retrieval.Full Stack : Handles both the client & server side.

So Netherlands were playing Rica in Quaters and the match was played in the extra time.Still the score was nil and the matches then went into Penalties.Jasper gave a rock solid performance the whole match and a substitution happened Jasper was out and the former Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was brought in.I was seriously baffled and Jasper was like What the F*ck is happening.He was way frustrated by the subsitution and kicked the bottle.I was like now Ricans will win on penalties but Tim Krul made heroic penalty saves and sent the Netherlands into the semis were they will face Argentina. Later on i found the thing related to it where someone just told why did the whole incident occurred.Van Gaal told this in an interview “We said nothing to Jasper because we didn't want him to know before the game,” Van Gaal said. “But as I've explained, every keeper has specific qualities. “Tim has a longer reach and a better track record with penalties than Cillessen. “We had discussed it with Tim. He knew about their penalties because he needed to be prepared. “It worked out. If it hadn't, it would have been my mistake. “Every player has certain skills and qualities and they don't always coincide. We felt Tim would be the most appropriate keeper to save penalties. “You have seen that Tim dived to the right corner twice. We are a tiny bit proud this trick has helped us through.” Van Gaal has confirmed that Cillessen will reclaim his place in goal for the clash against Argentina. But Krul, who has saved just two of twenty penalties for Newcastle, admitted he was desperate for a chance to impress at the World Cup. \\"I did not realise it was so late,” Krul said. “I had spent the whole match on the bench, but we had chance after chance and had not taken them. “Then you're suddenly thrown in and don't have time to think, but I saved two penalties and now we're semi-finals of the World Cup. \\"I knew there was a chance that I would get there and during the extra time it started to itch. “Then it finally so turns out that you're going to play in the quarter-finals to get you to the semi-finals, which is a childhood dream.”"},{"instruction":"When I was a child, Smokey Bear said Only YOU can prevent forest fires.

That means all the other galactic empires are likely bigger as they really do control entire galaxies with millions of worlds.

If you set a paper easy, everyone will attempt everything and tukka-logy will be on the high. Rather than merit, exam temperament has a major say because one blunder you make, you are out of the race.And talking of blunders, the mistake of NTA doesn’t end here.NTA filled this easy question paper with ambiguous questions and didn’t account for it later. Dear NTA, this is not JEE, this is NEET and you can’t have multiple answers to a single question and even if there is, you ought to give bonus TO ALL.That colloidal question? If you would have put only the single correct option, all the people who left the question due to negative marking or marked the incorrect one due to doubt, they would have marked it right. If you don’t give bonus to all thinking they should have marked the correct option, it’s wrong because it was your mistake and we are nowhere responsible for it.Your answer key was another mistake. Talking of your final answer key, you changed the chemistry question from -30 to +30, which to many is a big blunder. You never changed the cornea question and accept it or not, it was the most genuine challenge the aspirants made.This last thing which I fortunately didn’t experienced was that in the results, many are seeing a difference in their calculated marks from the answer key and the one they actually got. HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE AND THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. Dude, if one got less then it’s possible someone got more. And from what I have read and listened, there isn’t difference of 2–5 marks, I have read and heard people saying there’s a difference of 70–100 marks. Even some of my friends had this too.

Why? Why not? How? How not? But, not curious enough to know these answers. Today, you’ll be knowing answers to some of those questions. Let’s get on to the fun part. Dream Window Seat Why Kangana Ranaut gives away the tickets? No that's not the question. Why IRCTC won't let you pick your favorite berth? After successfully logging into the IRCTC website you pray your next wish is answered, that is our favorite window seat. Finally, when you book, you don't get the window seat you opted for. So why is this? Imagine there are sleeper class coaches in a train numbered S1, S2 S3... S12, and in every coach, the window seat corresponds to the lower berth, the middle seat corresponds to the middle berth, and the aisle seat corresponds to the upper berth. So when someone first books a ticket, the software will assign a seat for the older people in the lower berths. You might have wondered why? Is this completely because of senior citizen concession? Not completely. But, partly. This is because old people are considered to be heavier in weight in most cases. (with a few exceptions). As long as heavier people are in the lower berths, the center of gravity lowers in distance from the ground and the train becomes more stable. This is why you might also find the youngest getting the upper berth. Also, the software with the algorithm operating behind the scene books seats in such a way lower berth tickets first to achieve a low center of gravity. This poses a grave danger of derailment if not followed correctly. As in the case of a human, if your center of gravity lies in your head, you can’t walk properly. As the same, more weight in the upper berths could cause a derailment. Profiling is also a factor while allocating seats. Extra Rails Have you ever seen these additional rail lines inside the main track? You may find these additional lines are found in railway bridges, level crossings, sharply curved railway tracks, etc. These additional rails are called Guard Rails. The main motive of these additional rail lines is to prevent excessive damage in the derailing of trains. In railway bridges, these are designed to keep people or vehicles from falling off the bridge. In level crossings, in addition to the prevention of derailing, these guard rails hold the concrete/tiles/material of construction of road together between them. So that the material will not become an obstacle for the movement of wheels of the train and to allow the flanges of the wheels to pass through. Curved roofs Why are train roofs curved? For those who mostly sleep in the upper berths might have this question. These curves would have made you feel sleep in a less spacy environment. Why is it so? No, it is not for traveling on top of roofs When a train is moving there is always a vacuum generated after every coach (the same as in a sedan shaped car, that is why sedan doesn't have rear windshield wipers). The curved roofs help in generating less vacuum by pushing more air.Rain droplets will drain sideways rather than between the coaches since the wind will push it back when the trains moving.A sharp figure will have more stress concentration on the corners leading to failure of the design of shapes. Good Night Ever wondered how can you fall asleep so easily while traveling by train? Because, the coaches are designed with a resonance frequency of suspension of 1.2 Hz, this is the same frequency that the human body is most comfortable with. Rail profile Why does a railway track have a particular shape like I? Have you ever hold a heavy load on your head? What are the position of your legs at that time to hold that load most comfortable manner? Maybe like this. Your legs will keep apart not adjacent. In this position, you can better hold your load on your head. If you adjacent your legs you can't hold that load comfortably. Ɪ - A remarkable structure used in structural and design engineering. Both rectangular and I section provide the same bending strength. The maximum stress is in the top and bottom sections of a beam. There is no effect in the neutral or middle region. So, to avoid wastage of material I section is preferred. So, to provide maximum strength in the least possible materials, I sections are used. Those Stones Why are there stones on railway tracks? Most of us must have wondered at least once in our lives why there are stones on railway tracks. These crushed stones are called track ballast and they help keep the train tracks in place. Track ballast is the collective term for the crushed stones on railway tracks. They form the trackbed and are packed around railway tracks. They form the ground for the railway sleepers which are used to keep the railway tracks upright and properly spaced. Railway sleepers are the rectangular support piece kept perpendicular to the tracks. A railway sleeper is also called a railroad tie or a crosstie. Sleepers used to be made of wood earlier but now they are mainly created with pre-stressed concrete. Apart from holding the railway lines in place and providing support for heavy trains to pass on, here are the other functions of the stones called track ballast: The stones don’t allow vegetation to grow on railway tracks which could weaken the ground on which the railway lines run.Track ballast also keeps water from reaching the track on a regular basis and softening the ground. It doesn’t completely seal off water from the railway tracks but it facilitates proper drainage beneath or around the tracks to ensure that the water doesn’t stay on it. Train vs Bus Why are passenger seats on trains placed facing one another, instead of all facing the same direction as buses? Buses travel only in one direction. Trains, on the other hand, can go in either direction. They pull into a terminus and can't go any further so they have to reverse direction so seats on trains are a compromise with some facing one direction and others facing the other. Trains travel with uniform acceleration and there is no jerk in a train traveling. Hence, Inertia is conserved. This makes train traveling more suitable than bus travel. This is why you can walk freely on the train without hand supports which you can't do while you're on the bus. The chaiwala or tea vendor whatever you may call, manage his sales comfortably. Nausea Why does motion sickness occur in a car, but not on a train? While traveling by car, the natural frequency of the car would be in the range of 0 Hz - 2.5 Hz (even more than this in case of sports cars) and this is varying in nature. As said earlier, humans are most comfortable in the frequency range of 1 Hz - 1.5 Hz, this is most suitable for traveling. Anything below this frequency of the range 0.5 Hz -1Hz will cause motion sickness. The visceral region of the body objects to frequencies between 5Hz - 6.5Hz. The head and neck regions are especially sensitive to vibrations of 18 to 20 Hz. Fortunately, our trains are designed in such a way that both the resonance frequency (1.2Hz) of the train and the human body matches. This is why you also feel comfortable reading books on the train without headaches. Extras: All the electric appliances (fans, lights) in rail coaches function at 110 volts instead of the Indian standard 220 volts. It is a very effective counter-measure against thieves! Almost 2 lakh towels, 81,000 bedsheets, and over 7,000 blankets were stolen from Indian trains between April and September in 2018. Thank you!

Wouldn't that be more effective than having an open bunker on top of a hill?","output":"Tried to find some photos, but your thinking isn’t too far out of line. During the 1960’s and 70’s when tensions between the Soviets and China were high, the Soviets took WW2 era tank turrets and mated them with bunkers that could hold a large amount of ammunition for both it’s main gun and machine guns. They were to be supported by infantry and sited on important stretches of border where the thought was the Chinese would attack from. They built bunkers were far wider then the tanks they were taken from which gave the crews more room and ironically made them more accurate with a faster fire rate. I believe Tom Clancy discussed them in one of his fictional books on a conflict between China and Russia near the fall of the Soviet Union. I’m going to have to think about the title. And the Russians were not the only ones to follow the process. The US used the guns off of one of the sunk BB’s at Pearl Harbor and mated it to a shore battery. One of the Scandanavian countries took an entire battleship turret and used it in a 4 story deep bunker. The French took small caliber turrets salvaged from scrapped WW1 warships and mated them within the Maginot line to save some francs as support artillery behind the lines (not many as it turned out more expensive.) Sorry, posting this on my phone so my search is limited right now. I’ll try to come back with the name of the book as well as more definitive information and photos."},{"instruction":"what ways was Christianity morally superior to the paganism it replaced?","output":"I dont think the Crusades, The Holocaust, The Salem Witchtrials, revising history, lying, makes Christians morally superior.

Friendships can come in many different forms and can be shaped by various factors such as culture, age, and gender. In this response, we will explore the definition of friendship from different perspectives and offer some examples of what friendship can mean. Psychological Perspective From a psychological perspective, friendship is defined as a close relationship between two individuals that is based on trust, mutual respect, and enjoyment of each other's company. In order for a friendship to exist, there must be a sense of intimacy, loyalty, and emotional support. Some common characteristics of friendships from a psychological perspective include: Mutual affection and caring for each other's well-beingShared interests and activitiesOpen communication and honestyPositive regard and respect for each otherWillingness to help and support each other in times of need Cultural Perspective The meaning of friendship can vary across different cultures. In some cultures, friendships may be highly valued and play an important role in social life. In other cultures, friendships may be seen as less significant or may be defined differently. For example: In some African cultures, the concept of Ubuntu emphasizes the interconnectedness of all people and the importance of building relationships based on compassion and empathy.In Japanese culture, the concept of \\"tatemae\\" refers to the idea of maintaining a polite and respectful façade in social interactions, while \\"honne\\" refers to one's true thoughts and feelings. This can affect how friendships are expressed and experienced. Philosophical Perspective From a philosophical perspective, friendship is often seen as a type of virtue that involves a shared commitment to moral values and personal growth. Aristotle, for example, believed that true friendship is a virtuous relationship that is based on mutual admiration, shared values, and a desire for the well-being of the other person. Some key elements of friendship from a philosophical perspective include: Shared virtues and valuesA commitment to ethical principlesMutual respect and admirationA desire for personal growth and development The meaning of friendship can vary across different perspectives, but there are some common themes that emerge. At its core, friendship is about creating a meaningful connection with another person that is based on mutual respect, trust, and caring. Whether it is defined by psychological, cultural, or philosophical factors, friendship is a crucial aspect of our lives that can bring joy, support, and personal growth.

Geological evidence Geological formations clearly show that there was no major flood anywhere near the timeline in the Bible.Geological evidence also shows that there has never been a flood over the entire earth. The Grand Canyon, for instance, provides geological evidence that it was formed over a millions of years and not part of a global flood.Evidence in The Dry Valleys of Antarctica show that they have not been exposed to water for around 2 million years.Ice core samples would be expected to show salt content at a certain depth if there had been a worldwide flood that combined oceans, but no such salt content is found.Salt flats could not have formed in the timespan since the flood, so could not have been flooded.Several deserts were still deserts during the flood timeline and not flooded.Charcoal found in sedimentary layers dated to the time of the flood were the result of fires, which would not have happened under water. Mathematical evidence All the water on earth could only raise the global sea level by an estimated 70 meters (130 feet) maximum.Mt. Ararat was supposedly the first mountain exposed when the flood receded. It is 5137 meters high. 70 meters of water would not cover it.Mt. Aararat is not even the largest mountain in the Middle East. Mt. Demavand, near Tehran is 5671 meters. Mt. Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, at 8848 meters. Archaeological evidence Several cultures predated the flood myth. They just continued on building their societies while they were supposedly killed off by a flood.The Hebrew flood myth was borrowed from much older religions in the Middle East. The Hebrews modified the Gilgamesh flood myth and added Noah, who was not part of the original myths.Every few years a claim is made that the ark has been discovered in Turkey. Each time the wood fragments have been found to be less than 2000 years old. Hoaxes continue anyway. Biological and Genetic evidence If the surface of the planet were flooded for a prolonged period of time, all plant life would be wiped out. Even hardy trees could not survive 3 months.Inbreeding caused by preserving only a pair of a species would not create the biodiversity on the earth in hundreds of thousands of years, much less 5000.DNA evidence shows that species today did not come from single pairs, but diverged from common ancestors hundreds of thousands of years ago.If two of each species were on board the ark, the fossil record in the Middle East would show skeletal remains of animals from around the world. Kangaroos, pandas,American bison, and llamas, for example, would have left remains. But no remains of animals from outside the Middle Eastern region have been discovered there.DNA evidence shows that humans cannot be traced back to a single family 5000 years ago, or even 100,000 years ago.The different races of humans diverged at least 20,000 years earlier than the flood myth. Blacks, Caucasians, Asians, American Indians, and Pacific islanders were somehow not included in the flood.All fresh water fish would have died from increased salinity in water caused by a flood connecting oceans and bodies of fresh water. Engineering evidence Engineers agree that the ark, as described in detail in the Bible would not be seaworthy or even float. Even wooden ships much smaller would have had issues in prolonged storm conditions.The ark could not have been built as described, even with modern technology. An attempt was made to build the ark in Kentucky. It is used as an amusement park and the owners even filed claims for water damage.2 of each animal species on earth could not fit on the ark. If only a few species were put on the ark, they would all die within a few days due to poor ventilation and build up of toxic gases. Even with modern ventilation it is not possible to properly ventilate the ark because of the flawed design.The feed for thousands of animals over 40–304 days would not fit on the ark and could not be stored for that length of time without rot. Contradictory claims in the Bible The length of the flood changes in the story. It cannot be both 150 days and 304 days.150 days (Genesis 7:24 “And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.”)40 days (Genesis 7:17 “For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth”)304 days (Genesis 8:5 “The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.”)Following the flood, which killed all life on earth except Noah’s family on the ark, the Kenites and the Nephilim tribes are encountered.

It is essential to take note of that while Ayurvedic meds are believed by certain people, logical proof supporting their adequacy and wellbeing is many times restricted. It is vital to talk with a certified Ayurvedic specialist or medical services proficient prior to utilizing any Ayurvedic medication for diabetes.

The question smells of pure bias. Did the inquirer ask this question of previous Prime Ministers ‘for not’ celebrating a festival with the army jawans? Why did they not? Why did they spend it with their families or political friends? Is the inquirer implying that the army is ‘not secular’? If not, then our Prime Minister is spending his holiday with the jawans who deserve all the appreciation they can get. And if a PM comes to celebrate, they feel he is with them at a moment when they miss their homes and families and friends. In the PM they see the leader of the country sharing his with them, inspiring them, lifting their spirits up. Or has that not occurred to the inquirer? The army has men and women from all religions, and so, sharing a day with them is not communal, is it? If the PM spent any other festival with the army it may be termed as ‘secular’ but then over 4 out of 5 army personnel are Hindus and that is why it is more prudent to spend Deepawali with them rather than any other festival. Now, let’s look at some ‘secular’ leaders of this country and please be honest with yourselves by answering if these actions are ‘secular’ or hypocritical? Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad. I as a Hindu know, and can recite the first Kalma. Can these skull cap displaying ‘secular’ leaders do that? For the sake of votes if they want to appease the Muslims, it isn’t secularism - it is a fraud. What have they really done for the uplifting of the poor minorities? Nothing! One is known for his Gunda-raj and the other for succumbing to the former. And this lady here - Mamta Banerjee. Is she secular? I bet she is not; she is anti-Hindu, so she can’t be secular either. How long will she be tolerated, we need to wait and watch. Now let’s look at the ‘real seculars’ - Akhilesh, Mulayam and Amar Singh. Are they secular? The reason Samajwadi Party lost the elections in UP heavily is because of the Muslim-Yadav combination which the party stood for. More specifically, the Muslims of UP (especially the women) voted en-mass in favor of BJP. So, do the Muslims call the BJP anti-Muslim? If so, how many? 65 constituencies in UP where BJP won had a considerable Muslim population, and some like Deoband which has over 72% Muslim population elected a Hindu on a BJP ticket. What does that tell us about secularism? Here is our very ‘secular’ common man - Aam Aadmi Kejriwal. Look at the picture above and below. Don’t you think that this is a farce? Once again, what does this pic above tell us? Are Mr. Singh and Mr. Kejriwal really offering a prayer? How? These are photo-ops not to be missed. In the picture below we have the Honorable Vice President of India, Hamid Ansari. At a function, the VP, a respected Muslim is not using the occasion for a political gimmick but Mr. Kejriwal is. Guess what is says? I would rather have a Prime Minister Narendra Modi who DOES NOT insult a religion by faking his actions. He is honest in his actions. I like to see him happily get a real hug rather than posing for a photo-op. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday offered a ‘chaadar’ on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the dargah of Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. Before we point fingers at a man who has so far had a spotless, highly appreciable and very popular stint as the Prime Minister, let’s appreciate what he has done so far. Blind hatred has been the bane of India since independence. What the ‘secular’ parties have done so far is self-evident when we see that either the Hindus are irked by un-necessary appeasement of minorities, or the minorities are angry now, because the seculars have done nothing more than exploiting them, and worse, for creating a non-existent fear psychosis among the minorities. A classic example of blatant misuse of power with total disregard for India’s reputation, integrity and honor in 2005.

In fact pickups are a gold mine business because you won't know if you like them until you solder them in and once you do you can't return them. You play Russian Roulette everytime you buy a set of pickups. I've learned over the years to pay attention to other's tone and then ask them about their pickups. Some humbuckings I've been exceptionally happy with are DiMarzio Evolutions which sound fantastic in mahogany guitars. I have a set in my mahogany Iceman and it's one of my best sounding guitars. I also have a set in my Ibanez RG which is a basswood Super Strat and sounds like Steve Vai's JEM guutars. They are basically a P.A.F. with stacked magnets of two types (I believe alnico 3 & 5), and a finer guage wire. They are sensitive and are recommended for expert players who can control feedback and know how to use the volume knob for control. They can sound super chimey clean for jazz and sizzely distortion for metal. Listen to Steve Vai for a taste although his guitars are basswood and I don't think the pickup sounds as good in basswood. They are considered custom made as each pickup is made to order. They will make them in any color you desire. They are pricey. Over 400 for a set. My second choice is a custom made set of pickups from Ian Anderson of San Marcos, CA. His pickups are exact replicas of 1958 Seth Lover pickups found in those early Les Pauls. Ian uses period-correct bobbins, bases, covers, wire and magnets although he gives you your choice of alnico 2, 3, 4, and 5. If you like the sound of Led Zeppelin, Joe Walsh, ZZ Top, Aerosmith, etc these pickups sound exactly right in a Les Paul. Ian sells them for under 300. Note: to get the tone exactly right you need paper-in-oil capacitors (.022) and 1” potentiometers. A good runner-up is the Rio Grand pickups from Robin Guitars of Houston, TX. The story goes Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top is a friend of the owner and Billy let the owner disassemble the lickups in Billy's famous guitar, “Pearly Gates\\". The owner measured everything and the Rio Grand was born, a faithful recreation of Billy's Pearly Gates pickups. I have a set in my SG and it sounds very Gibson. They run a little over 200 each. For single coils, the best I ever heard was Fender's John Mayer pickups. Unfortuneately you can only get them if you buy the whole Strat or someone parts them out on ebay. If you can get them, people want a fortune for them. Second choice is Ian Anderson of San Marcos, CA again. He builds authentic period correct single coils for Strats and Teles. He even offers some extra voodoo for the bridge pickup. They are reasonable for a set. About 250 a set. My third choice should be my first choice but isn't for a reason I will reveal later. Ron Ellis pickups of Carlsbad, CA. The story goes: Ron Ellis was an engineer for General Atomics and had access to a mass spectrometer at work. He talked a few vintage guitar owners into letting him reverse-engineer the electronics in some old Strats and Teles. The result was pickups with the same metalurgy and magnetic fields of the originals. And he can make authentic sounding replacements for those guitars. Then he created hybrid sets. The Strats of the '50’s sound different than the Strats of the '60’s because they changed from alnico 3 to alnico 5 magnets. So. Ron created a pickup with two magnet halves. The bass strings have an alnico 3 magnet and the treble strings have an alnico 5 magnet emphasizing the best parts of the sounds of those guitars in their respective decades. His last bit of magic was winding the bridge pickup to sound like and have the output of a Telecaster which has a hotter bridge pickup than a Strat, strengthening what is considered the weak point of a Stratocaster. He calls this set the 50’s/60’s Hybrid with the Hot Bridge set. It's expensive but understandably so. Each pickup is hand made, measured and autographed by Ron himself. The bad part? Once you've ordered your pickups and PayPaled him the money, it can take two years to get them. He doesn't email you; doesn't call you, doesn't answer his phone; doesn't answer texts or emails. No status reports; no communication at all. About the time you've resigned yourself to believing you flushed nearly 350 for pickups away, they show up in a neat little box in your mailbox. They look beautiful and drop right in and sound amazing..the bridge pickup kicks ass with distortion. I have a set in an ash Strat and I love them but the buying experience was anxiety inducing. My overall opinion is if you're going to upgrade pickups, do research. Go to forums. Read reviews. Ask musicians in your favorite bands what they're using. Be prepared to jump through whatever hoop is required to get the tone you want. I have an ammo can full of pickups that I didn't like that I'm willing to sell. Remember, it's Russian Roulette! Good luck! 🙂👍"},{"instruction":"w can I get a free Hotstar membership?","output":"Well if you are looking to access the Hotstar premium content for free then I have a trick for free.

A mix between a dachshund and a German shepherd, Siske was not really cute. Rather a short legged shepherd. Moreover as a pup he had broken a paw slipping on a carpet, the plaster cast had not been applied correctly and so he was left with a crooked paw. But, boy, this dog was a mastermind. When he needed to pee, he sat next to the front door and barked. We just had to open the door and wait till Siske had made his little walk and barked again to be let in. There were few cars in our street and Siske had only one accident, when a cyclist in a hurry bumped against him. One evening - it was already late and dark - Siske barked, my husband opened the front door and said: ‘Go and just don’t come back’. You probably guess hubby was not too fond of our ‘cutie’. Half an hour, one hour, two hours pass. Siske doesn’t come back. Hubby and I start to quarrel. Horrible scenarios run through my head. Had he been hit by a car? Had he been dog-napped for experiments in a medical laboratory? We decided to go and look for him in the whole neighborhood, hubby to the left, me to the right. After maybe ten minutes, hubby shows up, holding Siske in his arms, tenderly as if he was a newborn baby. Me: ‘Where did you find him?’ Husband: ‘He was sitting quietly at the bus stop in a street a couple of blocks further.’ Yup, Siske had been offended.

It seems to me that this defeated the purpose of the book. Willy Wonka, when discussing his “latest and greatest invention: Television Chocolate”, in which a giant-sized Wonka bar is sent by a TV camera onto a TV set as a normal-sized bar that can be removed from the screen and eaten, states his feelings about TV: “I don’t like television myself. I suppose it’s all right in small doses, but children never seem to be able to take it in small doses. They want to sit there all day long staring and staring at the screen…” Later, the Oompa-Loompas sing a song about the dangers of watching too much TV: ♪”The most important thing we’ve learned So far as children are concerned, Is never, never, NEVER let Them near your television set— Or better still, just don’t install The idiotic thing at all…”♪ In the song, the Oompa-Loompas add that it’s better to read: ♪”Oh, books, what books they used to know, Those children living long ago! So please, oh please, we beg, we pray, Go throw your TV set away, And in its place you can install A lovely bookshelf on the wall… …They’ll now begin to feel the need Of having something good to read. And once they start—oh boy, oh boy! You watch the slowly growing joy That fills their hearts. They’ll grow so keen They’ll wonder what they’d ever seen In that ridiculous machine, That nauseating, foul, unclean, Repulsive television screen!…”♪ I’ll also never understand why I didn’t take more interest in reading (for instance, the Zoobooks magazine series, which was originally created by John Bonnett Wexo in 1980; this series describes numerous wild animals, e.g., elephants, wolves, turtles, sea otters, and polar bears, and why it’s important to prevent these animals from going extinct).

But every Turkic people have genome which can be traced back to the “Inner Asian homeland of the early Turks”. There were also several Turkic clans which adopted Chinese language and family names. Maybe even Turkic clans in Japan which got totally assimilated. About 2% of Japanese have paternal lineage N-Tat, most closely to the Turkic Yakut N-Tat and Kazakh N-Tat lineage. The most “pure” independent Turkic country is Kazakhstan. Turkey has about 21% East Asian / Turkic ancestry, which is quite high if we know the history of Anatolia and West Asia.

If you’re a handy person that knows how to fix a lot of problems around a house, I would recommend repairing your rental properties yourself. If you aren’t too handy of a person, I would still recommend repairing them on your own, at least until you get to the point to where you can begin hiring contractors. Hiring contractors to fix your rental properties can be costly and something that you maybe can’t afford or don’t want to pay to have them fix it. It is also can be a hassle looking up quotes and reviews for contractors to make sure you get someone who will do good work for a reasonable price. If the issues are relatively quick fixes, then I’d recommend just handling it on your own to avoid extra costs to your business. If you are someone who is early on in their property management career, repairing issues with the rental properties on your own can be a valuable skill. You learn so much about homes and repair by doing it yourself, and you feel a great sense of pride in being able to tackle and overcome these challenges by yourself. This all being said, if you’re not a handy person, although I’d recommend starting off by repairing your own rental property, when you get to the point where you have enough money to start hiring contractors I would recommend it. It’s nice to gain the experience for yourself, but there are some tasks you’ll learn that you don’t want to deal with, or that it is too much of a time commitment to make. Repairing rental properties can also be timely, and with how busy you’ll be managing properties already, sometimes it’s easiest to just hire a contractor."},{"instruction":"Why didn't Boston and New York airport officials get the sack after 9/11?

I never \\"learned\\" to lucid dream as it was just something that occurred naturally for me. I started having these in my pre-teens and only started studying about them in college, as I discovered that it was not a universal experience. This led me to Astral Projection. Astral projection took me quite a bit of effort to actually succeed. When I did do several ascensions into the Astral plane, it was instinctually and distinctively different. To myself, in lucid dreaming, it feels as if my other than conscious creates the environment and works its way out into consciousness. In Astral projection it feels like my consciousness works its way inward, into the other than conscious world, Astral plane, as some know it. This might explain why some people try lucid dreaming and wake themselves up. And some who try reaching the Astral plane fall asleep. Simply my own observation. From reading about other's experiences, it appears that some may find either lucid dreaming or Astral projection easier than the other. I would say either might take some effort so start with what feels easier for you."},{"instruction":"Did China have no choice but to implement the One Child Policy? What would have happened if China's population was allowed to grow unabated?","output":"There is always a choice. In this case it was between boosting the national economy and improving people’s standard of living or facing a much longer development path. Back in 1979, China was dealing with the fallout of a population that doubled to 1 billion in just 30 years. That was a quarter of the world's population living on just 7 percent of the world's farmable land. Since the 1950’s population growth had started to outpace the food supply. This could’ve been potentially economically and environmentally catastrophic. It has been estimated that the policy prevented about 400 million births. That’s the whole population of the US in terms of additional mouths to feed. During the period 1979 to 2012, China's % population growth was the same as that of India's. Extrapolating the trend then by 2012 China's population could have reached 1.75 billion. And although there are other factors impacting GDP growth China may not have had a GDP 5 times higher than that of India. Standard of living, education, healthcare, scientific and technological progress, even national security could be all affected. We may have seen a large out flux of of people to other countries. Possibly social unrest. And that’s pretty much it.

There is a certain tranquility and serenity about the story.The story is of somebody recognising what freedom is and taking that choice. The protagonist falls in love with nature. In climax,she abandons her marriage plans and instead starts living in the mountainous countryside and also starts her own small scale business there. It has been shot traversing over six states in buses and trucks. The shooting unit used to be like a kaafila (caravans), which used to move from place to place. It was shot chronologically with linear narration. There was travelling in Highway but the route taken in the film wasn’t the regular tourist route. It has been shot in isolated areas. The actress esaays a cine matic character. Her heartbreaking naivety justifies behavioral brain-fades; she makes us believe when she suddenly opens up to her Haryanvi kidnapper and she makes us believe when she breaks down by a quiet mountain stream. Highway is the soul every filmmaker works towards; a script too raw to make as a first film, but placed at the bottom of the pile as a reminder to believe. It's difficult to do those roles where there are few lines. Under intense pressure, humans can weep, laugh, dance, scream, fall in or out of love instantaneously, and it's impossible to explain this logically where there are very few lines to deliver. The tone and geography of the story changes and feel of these states support the film at that time when it travels through that state. For instance, there is a certain horrifying quality about a vast empty desert which comes at a point in the film where the horrific quality is required to give tone to the film. When you are in lush meadows there is a sense of belonging and completion, which by the time you reach Kashmir the film already feels like that. -Imtiaz Ali"},{"instruction":"Where can I find a loan shark fast?","output":"i hope this article helps you [LINKED_TEXT: Log In ‹ Online Reviewshttp://umeronline.online/wp-admin/post.php?post=154&action=edit] [URL: http://umeronline.online/wp-admin/post.php?post=154&action=edit]"},{"instruction":"British journalism superior to American journalism?","output":"The general feeling I have is that in the UK, it’s the worst of the newspapers at the bottom of quality, whilst in the US it’s the worst of TV news that’s lowest quality, with the papers getting a bit more respect.

It was called [LINKED_TEXT: Mo Hotta Mo Betta] [URL: https://www.mohotta.com/]. I sent for a catalog (you did that in those days) and ordered a dozen bottles of Dave’s Insanity Sauce for my colleagues at Apple. McIlhenny’s Tabasco sauce tastes great when it’s splattered on a slab of ham, but at 2,000 Scoville heat units (SCU) it isn’t really hot. I can pour the contents of a bottle into a cordial glass and sip it as a party trick. But Dave’s Insanity Sauce was something else. I forget what Scoville rating it had, but I’d been warned to consume it with caution. Good thing I followed that advice and tasted a drop of it first without glugging it down. It felt like an oxyacetylene flame on my tongue. Some years later I swallowed a capsaicin capsule rated at 200,000 SHU, an extract strong enough to peel paint off a ship’s hull. I was fine for a moment, and then I felt it—not a burning sensation, but more like being slugged in the gut, followed by feelings of nausea. That passed in a minute or two, and I learned to take those capsules with a hunk of bread and some water.

Head of our department was a gorgeous unmarried lady. I was there only for 6 months or so. We went for a business trip with all colleagues of our office. I was enjoying with others at beach. It was after sunset, suddenly I got a call from a senior. He called me in hotel room immediately, he told me that I need to work on a project and submit it before night. I quickly return to our hotel. When I entered our room, I was just shocked. I saw 4 of my senior colleagues there and there was a half naked blindfolded lady on bed with hands and legs tied up together. I was surprised so much and I thought I entered at wrong time. When I tried to run away, one of them held my hand and whisper me to stay with them. My seniors did a plan before going there that I wasn’t aware of. Our boss wanted to have fun with 4 senior employees that are working under her department. I didn’t know that our boss is such a slut like that. But they wanted to do another thing with her. They wanted to screw her from a junior and they chosen me for that. Also they did this trick that they blindfolded our boss so that she doesn’t know that. They insisted me to enjoy her body like that. I had nothing to do other than listen to them at that situation, so I did whatever they asked me to do. Another person recorded everything. But I got more surprised later when I saw someone else entering the room. It was the office boy. They told him that if he don’t listen to what they say, he will lose his job. They insisted him to lick our boss from top to bottom and ejacuate on her. She was blindfolded so she wasn’t aware whoever there is. They later told me the they did like this with boss few times before, but this time they wanted to do something different and surprise her. But she wasn’t aware of me and the office boy. After the trip, I submitted my resignation letter and leave the job. Few days later, she (my boss) called me and wanted to meet me in person. I was trying to deny but she was requesting so much that I couldn’t deny. When I met her, she was crying. She said she received some pictures and video clips of that night. She just got shocked by that and she wasn’t aware of what happened with her. She apologized to me and she was very regretful of what she has done in the past.

It uses a proof-of-work consensus technique, similar to Bitcoin, but has lower transaction costs. Also, it has a rather short processing time; transactions take about 5 minutes. Regrettably, DGB has some inflation, unlike Nano. This implies that if you want to store your money for a long time, its value will gradually decline. Bitcoin Cash A branch of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash was developed to address the scalability problems with the original Bitcoin network. Compared to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash features a greater block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be executed per block, improving speed and efficiency. Because of this, the Bitcoin Cash system has cheaper transaction fees than the Bitcoin system, making it a preferable choice for small transactions. Zilliqa One of the cheapest transaction costs in the sector is offered by Zilliqa or ZIL. Currently, using the Zilliqa system would cost you about one penny for every transaction. For the purpose of dApp creation and project launch, the Zilliqa platform was created. As this makes it simpler for creators to develop and commercialize their initiatives on the ZIL network, it is actually ideal that its token has one of the lowest transaction costs available. Dogecoin Another cryptocurrency that has attracted a lot of attention recently is dogecoin, which is used by well-known people like Elon Musk. Besides being started as joke money, Dogecoin has grown into a respectable cryptocurrency with a sizable user base. Low transaction costs are one of Dogecoin’s benefits, which make it a good choice for microtransactions and tiny transactions. Litecoin It is not surprising that Litecoin’s transaction costs are so cheap because this was always how its developers intended it to be used: as a payment option.

There seems to be a significantly larger portion of engineering students in India than in the US. Is the perception of engineering different? If so, why?","output":"Glad to see genuine questions on why the students choose engineering, rather than just bashing those who do as following a herd. That being said, there are beautiful answers on this topic already. However, being an engineering student myself; this answer of mine has been a long-time pain in my heart, and must be let out. As a forenote... People from outside India should understand that our vision of our own future is of a different focal length than yours. It is given that the career oppurtunities are very wide in countries like the U.S.A. For instance, you might have a degree in \\"waste management\\" which might set you up with a life; but even if we had that here, (as I believe there is!), God knows where it will possibly land us. Unfortunate as it is, we can't afford to let our ideas just fly, simply because there may not be a secure end waiting for us at the end of our studies. the actual reasons... 1. The majority of the country belongs to the middle-class, and you very well know what a middle-class family in India needs. Oh, I forgot! you don't. You might know only the cream of our population.Well, what it needs is at least half of the people in the family to EARN! And one must agree that as soon as you pass your degree, there is a high chance you get placed in a company that can pay you a decent salary. 2. Well, believe it or not, some of us go into engineering because we ACTUALLY LIKE IT. Deal with it! We like math! You just don't get the hang of it. what you possibly heard... 1. Here comes the problem. Here originates all the \\"engineering ruined my life\\" stories. I daresay 99% of such comments come from students who, after joining engineering, lose their focus and fail miserably. Not more than 10% of those who clear their degree successfully end up jobless! That is a risk you must take. 2. Another excuse for bashing engineering is the tagline \\"my parents forced me into it\\". Well if you let your parents decide what you should study after you were a grown-up, it is your mistake; not theirs! 3. The problem remains that even though you might get a degree in a trade like electronics or electrical, the chance of you getting a placement in the trade you studied is pretty thin. Most of the companies that do campus placements are related to the IT field. BUT, if you are willing to take a risk, you could attempt competitive exams to get a job in a company belonging to your core field. To conclude, the major reason for students choosing engineering is its capability to provide you a job more than any other degree in India; I repeat! MORE THAN ANY OTHER DEGREE IN INDIA!, followed by the passion of the students themselves. And you said pitfalls? Well, sorry to disappoint you, but those who have the passion don't really have any to discuss!After all, who would lead your corporate giants like Microsoft if we Indians didn't go into engineering??? pitfalls they say.

If he doesn't check his pockets, try constructing a hidden pocket inside one of his pockets. If your son is old enough and carries a cell phone, add an audio recording app. Those are highly sensitive and will pick up most conversations without being in view.

I am 5’ 4.5” tall and weigh 190. My measurements are 38-36–40. I wear a size 14/16 pant and a 16 0r 18/20 top as my bra size is a whopping 38H. I’ve always had a bit of extra. But was more on the hourglass side of the spectrum when younger, so was used to the attention I received from the opposite sex. Now? Well, I believe I have forgotten what positive attention even feels like anymore. In my late 20’s I started gaining more weight and reached 250lbs at one point. It was the most miserable I’ve ever been in my life. I couldn’t move- quite literally- without feeling disgust for what i’d Allowed to happen to my body. Every single movement reminded me of how completely repulsive I was. That’s a lot to deal with emotionally. My sister used to call me a whale when we were younger and i’ve been called husky, thick, a big girl, and have been asked if I wanted to stop to eat because they “knew I had to be hungry”. I wasn’t hungry, but did become quite humiliated when everyone, including my boyfriend at the time, thought it was hilarious that someone pointed out the shockingly total original “fat girl must be hungry” put-down. I did my best to lose the weight, but it didn’t come off fast enough to save me from having to hear that I was “too fat and I’m not attracted to you anymore” break-up line from the aforementioned funny guy boyfriend. We’d been together for 12 years. Being fat comes with an additional kind of special when you happen to yeah, be fat, but also have hyperhydrosis (a condition characterized by abnormally increased sweating, in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature. Although primarily a physical burden, hyperhidrosis can deteriorate quality of life from a psychological, emotional, and social perspective. It has been called by some 'the silent handicap). So on top of being a sweaty beast because I’m fat, it’s sort of like super-sizing the sweat factor and sometimes, if I’m not able to control my arrival or plan for some extra time to cool down enough to control my excessive sweating before being in public, I may look as if i’d Just stepped out of the shower, I’m that drenched. I’ve had to take to carrying extra clothes, layering clothes (which sucks because it makes me hotter) and wearing materials which don’t show any horribly embarrassing sweat marks. This means polyester is a good “backstabbing” buddy, as it takes a lot to see any sweat, but the breathability of the cloth is almost non-existent and I broil willingly just so I won’t look like i’ve Urinated my pants after I’ve been sitting awhile. Leaving a butt-shaped sweaty strip on unforgiving leather or plastic chairs is the bane of my existence. I’ve had to develop a scootch-swipe-wipe stand-up technique to try to hide the inevitable sweaty ass crack stamp I sometimes leave behind. I hate it and will mostly avoid sitting down if I’m in the grip of a sweapisode. I carry around a fan now- two types, a tiny usb charged blade fan for when it’s fucking serious. And a small silk folding fan for when it’s mild. I don’t care anymore when I get looks for being the fatty with a fan. The panic or anxiety attacks that I used to have before the fans, have at least subsided enough for me to take care of myself over caring what I look like to someone who has nothing to do with me or my life, so fuck em, why should I care. The overwhelming fear of being trapped where everyone can see how the fat person sweats like a pig is for me, the pinnacle of what flight (as opposed to fight- which would get me even more insanely sweaty) looks like. I often avoid going out in public during the day to busy places like the grocery store on a weekend, or somewhere like IKEA sends chills up my sweat dripping spine. I wont eat in front of people for fear of the judgement one might find in the eyes of jerk on-lookers. I don’t know that anyone is staring at me, but I become completely self-conscious that indeed, everyone’s looking at the blobby mess of a manatee chowing down on a burger. I’ve got no positive self-esteem to mention and believe that it reflects as such and others see it and avoid getting to know me. Who wants to be friends with a fat loser who sweats buckets and is awkwardly self-conscious to the point of social outcast? I can’t even look at myself in a full length mirror without forcing myself. Forget about being naked too. I revolt myself to the point of self-hatred and have not seen myself without clothes on for a good 20 years. I just can’t bear to meet my own eyes, or rolls, or cellulite. I’m deeply ashamed of my body and have never allowed any of my boyfriends to see me completely nude. I did have one boyfriend who was attracted to me and my walrus body once. I decided there must be something seriously wrong with him when he actually said he thought I was beautiful and loved everything about my body. He said some people just like what they like and he liked the way I looked. I just couldn’t compute this. How could anyone love fat? I decided he must be a liar and that the relationship was bound to go wrong when he finally realized how ugly I was. I broke up with him and regret it to this day. I’ve been alone for 8 years and am not getting younger or thinner, so, I suspect that I will be one of the unlucky folks who never know what love is, because I can’t love myself; not when I’m so hideously fat. Personally, I am not attracted to obese people like myself, I don’t see how anyone could be. But tragically I yearn to be loved and cared for, but am unable to see myself happy unless I’m thinner, and I just can’t seem to lose the weight anymore. I don’t look at people in the eye on the street, I keep my head down. One day, inside all of this swimming cellulite, and fat, and fatigue at living my life, i’ll finally let go and just drown. Or maybe i’ll Just find some measure of self-acceptance the way I did with my fans and my adaptability? Who knows. I wish I could be kinder to myself, but the message has been broadcast cruelly and clear by you, the people of society: fat people deserve to die because we “ chose to be social pariahs” and apparently have no usefulness to the rest of society. You all hold up your invisible blaring social queued pitchforks and signs of “Fat destroys lives and human decency!”, not caring that I would give almost anything to be thinner, and perfect enough to be loved. I feel like I need to lose enough weight in order to go to the gym to lose weight, because how dare I soil the gym with my fat essence?!. I don’t know what to do to get beyond the hurdles and roadblocks society and I myself place in front of me in these most self-destructive & vicious ways. Maybe through kindness that the rest of you will misconstrue as that’s just what those fatties do, right? Aren’t we all jolly and roly poly? Don’t all fat people like doing shit they’d rather not, but do so you will see that there is a kind and giving person underneath this blue whale blubber? sorry for the novel, and sorry for the depressive moody “woe is me” tone.

Here are some of the best strategies to help you lose weight: 1. Set Realistic Goals: Start with achievable and realistic weight loss goals. Aim for gradual and steady progress rather than extreme or rapid weight loss. 2. Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods. Incorporate lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and low-fat dairy or dairy alternatives. 3. Calorie Management: Create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body burns. You can do this by tracking your calorie intake and being mindful of portion sizes. 4. Portion Control: Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portions visually. 5. Mindful Eating: Eat slowly, savor your food, and pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. This can help prevent overeating. 6. Hydration: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger. 7. Regular Exercise: Engage in regular physical activity to burn calories and improve your overall health. Aim for a combination of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, cycling) and strength training (like weight lifting or bodyweight exercises). 8. Cardiovascular Exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days. 9. Strength Training: Include strength training exercises to build lean muscle mass. Muscle burns more calories at rest, helping with weight loss. 10. Lifestyle Changes: Make sustainable changes to your daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking more, and reducing sedentary time. 11. Sleep: Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can hinder weight loss efforts. 12. Stress Management: Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. 13. Healthy Snacking: Choose nutritious snacks like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and yogurt. Avoid sugary and highly processed snacks. 14. Limit Sugary and Processed Foods: Minimize your intake of sugary beverages, sweets, and highly processed foods, which can contribute to weight gain. 15. Track Progress: Keep track of your food intake, exercise, and progress. This can help you stay accountable and identify areas for improvement. 16. Stay Consistent: Consistency is key. Sustainable weight loss takes time, so stay patient and committed to your goals. 17. Seek Professional Guidance: If you're struggling with weight loss, consider working with a registered dietitian, nutritionist, or healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance. Remember that everyone's journey is unique. What works for one person may not work for another. The key is to find a combination of strategies that are sustainable and suitable for your lifestyle and preferences. Always prioritize your health and well-being throughout the process."},{"instruction":"Would a random number generator be more or less random than me just randomly saying numbers?

However as many here have already pointed out, it is the blunt, soft-nose, or hollow point bullets that do the most damage. This is because they have more shock value than a pointed round, and by expanding upon impact, they impart more damage. So if blunt bullets are more effective and damaging, why are there some bullets that are sharp? The answer is threefold: Pointed bullets (Spitzers) are much more aerodynamic with less drag than blunt ones. This allows them greater accuracy and at greater ranges.Pointed rounds feed into the firing chamber easier with less problems than blunt rounds, especially with fully automatic weapons.The Hague Convention of 1899 (often confused with the later Geneva Convention) prohibited the use of bullets that flatten and easily expand in a body in international warfare. Thus military rifle rounds are pointed, while many civilian and law enforcement rounds are blunt."},{"instruction":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","output":"I was happy today when I saw an old friend who I hadn't seen in months.

This is what allegedly occurred in the village of Woolpit in the county of Suffolk. The two, assumed to be siblings, were taken to the home of the home of local landowner, Sir Richard de Calne of Wykes, where they began to eat other types of food and gradually lost their green pigmentation. The boy, the younger of the two, grew ill and died but the girl adjusted to normal life and learned to speak English. When asked to describe her former life and origin, The girl reported that she and her brother came from the “Land of Saint Martin”, where there was no sun, but a perpetual twilight, and all the inhabitants were green like them.
