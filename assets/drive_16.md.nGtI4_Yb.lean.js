Gostkowski, who has been one of the most consistent and successful kickers in the NFL over the past decade, was tasked with kicking a field goal twice during the game – once in the first quarter and once in the third. Gostkowski's first field goal attempt came early in the game. The Titans were facing a fourth down and three yards to go on the Vikings' 31-yard line. Gostkowski successfully kicked the ball through the uprights, giving the Titans an early three-point lead. According to official statistics, the kick was from a distance of 49 yards. Later in the game, Gostkowski was again called upon to kick a field goal, this time from the Vikings' 40-yard line. The ball sailed through the uprights, but this time the kick was from a shorter distance of 54 yards. So, how many more yards was Gostkowski's first field goal over his second? The answer is five yards. Gostkowski's first field goal was from a distance of 49 yards, while his second field goal was from a distance of 54 yards. Despite the difference in distance, Gostkowski was successful on both attempts and helped contribute to the Titans' victory over the Vikings.

The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac, which is now used in common parlance to refer to roadmaking materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands, both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar.

Recently, she was apparently \\"horrified\\" by the dull and monotonous appearance of her hair. In order to restore the shine and lustre back in her locks, she decided to book an appointment with the famous hairstylist, Rossano Ferretti, whose services cost a whopping £600. Rossano Ferretti is renowned for his expertise in achieving a natural and effortless look. His signature \\"haircutting technique\\" involves chopping hair in a way that complements the natural texture and growth patterns of the hair, and not adding too much volume or layers. This, in turn, results in a low-maintenance hairstyle that retains its shape for a longer period of time. Duchess Kate decided to visit Ferretti's salon in London, and undergo an extensive hair treatment to revive her dull locks. The result was simply breathtaking. Her golden tresses appeared voluminous, bouncy, and full of life. The transformation was clearly visible, and Duchess Kate was able to show off her new hairdo at a recent charity event. This is not the first time that Kate has undergone a hair transformation. In the past, she has experimented with different hairstyles, ranging from bouncy blowouts to elegant chignons. However, this time, her new hairdo seems to have caught everyone's attention. Overall, the Duchess of Cambridge's decision to book an appointment with Rossano Ferretti seems to have paid off well. Her hair looks more vibrant, lively, and healthy. This goes to show that a good haircut and a proper hair treatment can go a long way in enhancing one's appearance."},{"instruction":"Woman Out of Control is second solo album by Ray Parker Jr. It was released in 1983 on the Arista label.

During his visit, Luther participated in the Christmastime liturgy at St. Peter and Paul Church. He also used his time in Eisleben to visit with family and friends, as well as to continue his translation work of the Bible into German. The visit was particularly meaningful for Luther as he was aware of his declining health and knew that it was perhaps the last time he would be able to visit his hometown. In fact, he did not feel well during his entire stay but was determined to make the most of it nonetheless. In hindsight, Luther's Christmas visit to Eisleben in 1545 can be seen as a poignant moment in his life.

However, protecting these assets can be challenging, and failing to do so can lead to costly legal battles and potential loss of revenue. That's why consulting with an experienced intellectual property attorney is an essential first step in safeguarding your valuable innovations and creative works.

Life rights agreements are used in entertainment and media to secure the rights to a person's life story or experiences. These agreements can be complex, and an attorney can ensure that you fully understand the terms and that your rights are protected. Another critical step in protecting intellectual property is registering all written material. Registration provides legal proof of ownership and is essential in defending your rights in court, should the need arise. Given the complexity of copyright law and changing regulations, consulting with an attorney can ensure your written works are adequately protected and registered. In summary, protecting your intellectual property is crucial to the success of your business or individual creative endeavors.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"As tensions rise between Iran and the West over the strategic Strait of Hormuz, defence officials are preparing for potential military intervention. The deployment of the HMS Argyll, along with other warships, has already taken place as a show of force to Iran. However, Iran remains defiant, vowing to block off the crucial waterway, which is responsible for the transport of a significant amount of the world's oil supply. In response to Iran's threats, leaders of major European nations, including Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy, and David Cameron, have issued a rare joint statement warning Iran of economic isolation if it follows through on its threats. The statement underscores the severity of the situation and highlights the international community's position on Iran's behavior. Despite these warning signals, Iran is standing firm, even as the US has warned that any closure of the strait would trigger a military response from the West. As such, defence officials are on high alert, ready to act if necessary. In interviews, UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has stated that reinforcements could be sent in the event of an escalation in the conflict. The current tensions come amid ongoing, broader concerns over Iran's nuclear programme. While Iran maintains that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, many nations remain skeptical, especially given Iran's history of human rights violations and support for terrorist organisations. As the situation continues to develop, the eyes of the world are fixed on the Strait of Hormuz, with many hoping for a peaceful resolution to this potentially explosive situation. However, given Iran's recent behavior, it appears that the West is preparing for the possibility of military intervention to safeguard the global supply of oil."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: when was the last time italy did not qualify for world cup?","output":"Italy did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup."},{"instruction":"Does Similarly, contemporary composers such as Nuno Malo and Miguel d'Oliveira have achieved some international success writing original music for film and television. correctly answer the question of Who are some notable musical composers from Portugal?

The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons. It was in von Neumann's 1944 papers that the expression kilotons appeared for the first time.

The young woman, who described herself as 'A slave to Allah' on Facebook, had traveled to the war-torn country with her husband, Yusif Ali. Mr. Ali, an Adelaide-born jihadist, was also killed in the conflict. He had been trained by Al-Qaeda overseas. Karroum and Ali were reportedly fighting a turf war with the Islamic State, another jihadist group operating in Syria. Their involvement in the conflict came to light when the Australian Federal Police confirmed that a small number of Australian women had fought in Syria. Karroum's decision to join a terrorist group and fight in a foreign conflict was a shocking development, especially for her family and friends. Her story highlights the growing trend of Westerners traveling to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside terrorist groups. While some may view this as a noble cause, it is important to remember that these groups are responsible for horrific acts of violence and have been designated as terrorist organizations by many countries around the world. The involvement of women in these conflicts is also a concerning development. While women have historically played a limited role in terrorism, there has been an increase in female participation in recent years. This trend has been fueled in part by the growing use of social media and online propaganda by extremist groups to recruit women and promote their cause. The death of Karroum and Ali is a tragedy for their families and communities. It is also a reminder of the dangers of extremist ideology and the need for continued efforts to combat terrorism both at home and abroad. As the Australian Federal Police have confirmed, there are Australians who have traveled overseas to engage in terrorism. It is crucial that authorities remain vigilant and continue to take action to prevent individuals from traveling overseas to participate in terrorist activities."},{"instruction":"Communications in Somalia encompasses the communications services and capacity of Somalia.

However, over time, these treasured albums can become warped and warped records can ruin the listening experience. Fortunately, there is a simple solution to this problem. To unwarp a vinyl record, you will need an oven, a baking sheet, a metal or glass heat-safe bowl, a heavy can, and of course, the warped record. The first step is to preheat your oven to a temperature of 200 to 250°F (100 to 120°C). This temperature is important, as if it's too high, it can damage the vinyl record. Next, open a window to ensure proper ventilation. Then, set the metal or glass heat-safe bowl on top of the baking sheet. Place the warped record on top of the bowl and ensure it is centered. Finally, place the heavy can on top of the record, applying enough pressure to keep it flat but not too much to cause it to crack. Once everything is in place, carefully place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the record to bake for several minutes until it starts to warp. The amount of time required for this process will depend on the degree of the warp. In any case, it's important to keep an eye on the record and not to leave it unattended. Once the record has started to warp, remove it from the oven and let it cool for several minutes. When cool, remove the record from the bowl and check to see if it has been restored to its flat shape. If necessary, repeat the process until the record is completely flat. In conclusion, warping is a common issue with vinyl records. Fortunately, there is an easy and effective way to unwarp them using a few simple tools and an oven. With a little bit of patience and attention, you can restore the sound quality of your vinyl collection and fully enjoy the music once again."},{"instruction":"bolivian landscapes, pictures of landscapes of bolivia Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","output":"\\"Bolivian landscapes, pictures of landscapes of Bolivia.\\""},{"instruction":"w might one describe the sentiment of this review?

Critic says the film pushes the envelope to get laughs.","output":"\\"This Is The End\\": A Star-Studded Comedy That Pushes the Envelope for Laughs When it comes to getting a laugh, it seems that there are no limits for the cast and crew of \\"This Is The End.\\" This comedy brought together a cast of stars, including James Franco, Jonah Hill, Emma Watson, Michael Cera, and Seth Rogen. Rogen, who not only co-stars in the film but also co-wrote the script, helped create a raunchy, outrageous, and often outrageous film that pushes the envelope. The plot for \\"This is The End\\" sees the actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves, trapped at Franco's house after the apocalypse breaks out. From there, the comedy takes off as they try to survive while everything around them seems to be disintegrating. One of the most notable aspects of the film is the way it pokes fun at celebrities and their public personas. Franco, Hill, and others are all targets of the humor, which is delivered in a delightfully irreverent way. But it's not just limited to the cast; there are also plenty of meta-jokes and references to the actors' previous work that fans of their past movies will enjoy. However, some critics have argued that the film goes too far at times, crossing the line between daring and distasteful. But despite this, the film's unique brand of humor has resonated with audiences, earning it a loyal following since its release. Overall, \\"This is The End\\" is a hilarious comedy that features a cast of talented actors who all seem to have genuinely enjoyed making the film. And although it may not be to everyone's taste, it's certainly worth checking out if you're looking for something that's a little bit different from the usual fare."},{"instruction":"Nah .

Whether it's from a family member, colleague, or friend, it can be frustrating to be told what to do, especially when we didn't ask for it. However, it's important to remember that the person giving the advice may have good intentions and genuinely want to help us. One way to handle unsolicited advice is to be patient. Rather than becoming defensive or dismissive, try to listen to the advice with an open mind. Consider whether the person has a valid point, and whether the advice could be beneficial to you in any way. It's okay to take some time to think about the advice before responding - this way, you can make a decision without feeling pressured. When you do respond, it's important to talk calmly with the person giving advice. Avoid getting emotional or defensive, as this can lead to a breakdown in communication. Instead, try to express your thoughts and feelings in a calm, concise manner. Acknowledge the person's perspective, but also be clear about your own boundaries and choices. Finally, it's okay to ask for trust and respect when receiving unsolicited advice. Let the person know that while you appreciate their concern and input, you ultimately have the final say in your own life. Ask them to respect your autonomy and decisions, even if they don't necessarily agree with them. In summary, being patient, talking calmly, and asking for trust and respect are all important when dealing with unsolicited advice. By handling it in a thoughtful, respectful way, we can turn what may be a frustrating situation into a learning opportunity."},{"instruction":"Trying to snap a fivegame losing streak, the Rams stayed at home for a Week 13 interconference duel with the Miami Dolphins.

He compares wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living , the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America. Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services.

The writing felt lazy and the dialogue was cheesy and unrealistic. The acting performances were subpar, and the characters lacked depth and nuance. Even the presence of big-name actors felt wasted, as they struggled to bring life to their poorly written characters.

Steam them into shape.","output":"When it comes to maintaining your brushes, there are a few tricks that can help prolong their lifespan and ensure they perform at their best. One important step is to thoroughly clean your brushes after each use, removing any excess paint or product. But after cleaning, what do you do? Before storing your brushes, it's important to squeeze out any excess water. This is because waterlogged bristles can cause the brush to lose its shape and longevity. Take care to gently squeeze the bristles from the base to the tip, taking care not to pull or twist them. Once you've removed the excess water, it's time to lay the brush flat, rather than storing it upright in a cup or jar. This allows the bristles to dry evenly and retain their shape. But what if your brush has lost its shape? Don't worry - you can easily reshape it. Simply dampen the bristles with water and use your fingers to reshape them back into their original form. For extra stubborn bends, use a hairdryer on a low heat setting to gently heat the bristles and reshape them into place. Finally, if you need a little extra help getting your brushes back into shape, try steaming them. Hold your brush over a pot of boiling water (without touching the water!) and let the steam penetrate the bristles for a few seconds. Then, use your fingers to reshape the brush while it's still warm. By following these simple steps, you can keep your brushes in great condition and ensure they perform their best for years to come.

Fans and players alike wait in anticipation for that big play to happen. So, which player threw the first touchdown pass of the game? The answer could vary depending on the game in question. If we are looking at a recent NFL game, we can find this information by checking the box score or game recap. For example, in the 2020 Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, quarterback Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs threw the first touchdown pass of the game to receiver Tyreek Hill. This was a crucial play for the Chiefs who were down 10-3 at the time and needed a spark to get their offense going. However, if we are looking at the history of football, the first touchdown pass of a game becomes a bit harder to track down. The first recorded touchdown pass in professional football history occurred on November 14, 1906, when quarterback Eddie Gardener of the Massillon Tigers threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Dan \\"Bullet\\" Riley. This was a historic moment that helped revolutionize the game of football and set the stage for the importance of the passing game.

Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or nonself, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or nonrelated species, and even filter out noise, i.e. similar molecules without biotic content. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply unanswerable): What 'noise' can't be filtered out?","output":"Unanswerable.

The previous record of 63 yards had been held by several players, including Tom Dempsey, Jason Elam, and Sebastian Janikowski. Prater's kick was a critical part of the game, as it allowed the Broncos to tie the score at the end of regulation and eventually win in overtime. However, Prater's second field goal of the game was not quite as impressive. In the fourth quarter, with the Broncos trailing the Tennessee Titans by a score of 21-20, Prater attempted a 47-yard field goal. Although he made the kick, it was significantly shorter than his record-breaking effort earlier in the game. To answer the question of exactly how many yards shorter Prater's second field goal was, we need to do some simple math. Subtracting 47 from 64 gives us a difference of 17 yards. Therefore, Prater's second field goal was 17 yards shorter than his first. While this may seem like a significant drop in distance, it's important to remember that kicking a field goal of any distance is a difficult and impressive feat. Even NFL kickers with years of experience regularly miss kicks from much closer ranges than 47 yards. So while Prater's second field goal may not have made the history books in the same way as his first, it was still an important and impressive contribution to the game."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

The first thing to look for is any notable wrinkles or creases in the fabric. This can give you an idea of whether the person is accustomed to sitting or standing for long periods of time. Another factor to consider is affluence. Certain professions require a certain level of financial stability or success, which can be indicated by the quality and style of their clothing. Pay attention to any designer brands or high-end materials. Fastidiousness is another key trait to look for. Professionals in fields such as law or medicine must maintain a certain level of cleanliness and attention to detail, which may be reflected in their clothing choices. Look for meticulously ironed shirts, polished shoes, and tailored suits. Finally, observe the person's body language. Their posture, facial expressions, and overall demeanor can give you insight into their level of confidence and authority. Someone who stands tall and maintains eye contact may hold a position of power, while a more subdued or nervous presence could suggest a lower-ranking role. By paying attention to these details, it's possible to make educated guesses about a person's occupation based on their clothing and other cues.

He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology. Gross's condition has deteriorated since being behind bars, and his wife, Judy, fears that he is close to death. The 65-year-old's fate now largely hinges on President Obama's efforts to improve ties between Cuba and the United States. Obama has been working to normalize relations between the two countries since 2014, and Gross's case has been a sticking point in those efforts. Gross's imprisonment has been a sore point for the United States, with officials repeatedly calling for his release. However, Cuban officials have been reluctant to release Gross, citing the country's laws against the importation of banned technology. Despite the lingering tensions, there have been signs of progress in recent years. In 2015, the United States and Cuba reopened embassies in each other's countries for the first time in more than 50 years. In 2016, Obama became the first US president to visit Cuba since 1928. Still, Gross remains behind bars, and his health continues to deteriorate. His wife has called on President Obama to do more to secure his release. \\"Alan is running out of time,\\" she said in a statement. \\"We need to bring him home before it's too late.\\" The fate of Alan Gross remains uncertain, but his case highlights the complex relationship between the United States and Cuba.

Spain was concerned about British expansion into territory that it considered to be its own, such as parts of what is now the United States.

It is one of the most populous counties in the state, with a population of over 600,000 people. The county is divided into several districts, which are represented by various government officials. The number of districts representing Brevard County changed over time. In 1967, Brevard County was divided into three districts. However, in 1970, the number of districts representing the county increased. As per the available information, the exact number of additional districts that were added in 1970 is not mentioned. The reasons for this districting change are not clear, but it is likely that it was due to the rapid population growth that the county experienced during the 1960s. As the population grew, it became necessary to create more districts to ensure that each area of the county was adequately represented in the government. Despite the lack of specific information on the exact number of additional districts, we can assume that the change was significant enough to have an impact on the political landscape of Brevard County. With more districts, more officials had to be elected, and the county had to allocate more resources to support these new officials.
