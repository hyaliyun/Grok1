By the start of the Devonian period (416 Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centered on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps.

Israel votes Tuesday after election campaign dominated by the country's right. More and more Palestinians see onestate solution as only way forward.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The upcoming election in Israel has put a spotlight on the issue of Palestinian statehood, with many Palestinians growing increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for a two-state solution. According to a recent report from CNN, a correspondent found universal pessimism in a West Bank town, where residents expressed frustration over the lack of progress in peace negotiations. Many Palestinians now see a \\"one-state solution\\" as the only viable option. This would entail the creation of a single state in the region that would ensure equal rights and protections for both Jewish Israelis and Palestinians. However, this idea is highly controversial, as Israelis fear that it would ultimately lead to Palestinians becoming the majority population. The issue of Palestinian statehood has dominated the recent election campaign in Israel, with the country's right-wing parties in particular taking a hard-line stance on the issue. This has left many Palestinians feeling disillusioned and marginalized, as their voices are not being heard in the political debate. The future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains highly uncertain, and it is unclear whether progress can be made towards a lasting peace agreement. However, the growing support for a one-state solution among Palestinians indicates that a new approach may be necessary if progress is to be made. It is clear that both sides will need to come to the table and engage in meaningful dialogue if a solution is to be reached that addresses the concerns of both Israelis and Palestinians."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

Search at night or on rainy days.","output":"The salamander is a fascinating amphibian that can easily be found in its natural habitat with a little bit of patience and knowledge. Visiting the salamander's home requires some preparation and understanding of the animal's behavior and environment. Firstly, it is important to know what to look for when searching for salamanders. They can be found in a variety of colors and patterns, so if you are unsure, a guidebook or knowledgeable local can be of great help. They are typically found in damp areas such as streams, ponds, and wetlands. Spring is the ideal time of the year to search for salamanders. This is because they usually emerge from their underground hiding places and are active during this season. They like to bask on warm rocky surfaces during the day and then start their hunt for food in the evening. When searching for salamanders, keep an eye out for edge environments. These are locations where two different types of land meet, such as a forest and a meadow, which provide great hunting grounds for salamanders. They can hide under rotting logs, stones, and in ground burrows. To successfully spot salamanders, it is also essential to look for their food sources like worms, insects, and spiders. They are mostly active at night or on rainy days, so visiting during these times will increase chances of finding them. In conclusion, visiting the salamander's home can be a fun and rewarding experience. With knowledge and patience, you can successfully spot and observe these fascinating creatures. Remember to always respect their habitats and leave them untouched after your visit."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: More advanced tests thinlayer chromatography bile analysis are available to analyze the contents of the stomach and vomit which should definitely confirm or refute the diagno","output":"More advanced tests such as thin-layer chromatography, bile analysis, are available to analyze the contents of the stomach and vomit, which should definitely confirm or refute the diagnosis."},{"instruction":"***** FRIENDLY REMINDER****** The RSVP's for the Guadalupe Power Partners invitation sent to you via email last week is due by June 8th.

One of the easiest ways to improve your hairstyle is by using styling scissors on the top of your head.

To achieve the best results possible, it’s important to trim the top of your hair in sections. This will allow you to work on one area at a time and ensure precision in each cut.

Remember to take it slow and avoid taking off too much hair at once, as this can easily result in a mistake that is difficult to fix. In addition to using styling scissors to trim your hair, it's also essential to take care of them properly.

After seeking legal advice, it is important to compare the original agreement or contract to the work that has been completed to ensure that both parties are on the same page.

Arbitration is a quicker and more cost-effective alternative to litigation and can provide a final decision on the matter.

The worst of it all was how unproven rookie Eric Rowe was tasked with covering wide receiver Calvin Johnson for the majority of the games, leading to Johnson catching 3 touchdowns.

Whether you are a seasoned artist or a beginner looking to start a new hobby, this simple guide will help you create stunning wood art pieces that are sure to impress. The first step in creating your wood art piece is to choose a suitable piece of wood. You can find pre-cut wood pieces at most craft stores, or you can cut your own piece to the desired size using a saw. Once you have your wood piece, you can paint the sides if desired to add an extra pop of color. Next, choose your Mod Podge. Mod Podge is a popular craft glue that can be used to adhere paper to wood. There are different varieties of Mod Podge available, so choose the one that is best suited for your project. After selecting your Mod Podge, print out your desired picture using a laser printer and regular paper. It is important to use a laser printer, as inkjet prints will not adhere to the wood properly. Next, apply a thick coat of Mod Podge to the front of the picture. Be sure to cover the entire surface of the paper evenly. Once the Mod Podge is applied, lay the picture face-down onto the wood. Make sure to smooth out any bubbles or wrinkles in the paper to ensure it adheres properly. After the picture is in place, allow it to dry. Once the picture is dry, use a damp cloth to soak the back of the paper. Rub the paper off of the wood gently to reveal the picture. Be careful not to rub too hard, as this may damage the image or the wood. Once the paper is removed, allow the wood to dry completely. Then, apply 2 to 3 coats of regular Mod Podge to the entire surface of the wood. This will protect the image and ensure it lasts for years to come.

The lawsuit claims that the dentist's conduct was dangerous and negligent, with a failure to provide appropriate care and monitor Boyle's condition adequately. The family hopes the lawsuit will hold the dentist accountable and provide them with the compensation they need to care for their daughter's ongoing medical needs. The case is a tragic reminder of the importance of proper medical care and the devastating consequences of medical malpractice. The Boyle family is seeking justice for their daughter in the hopes that no family will have to endure the same pain and suffering they have experienced.

Brookes alleges that she was introduced to Savile by a cameraman friend of her family when she was just nine years old. She says that Savile then subjected her to horrific abuse. Brookes' testimony is just one of many that has come out in recent years regarding Savile's predatory behavior. The former BBC star has been accused of abusing hundreds of young people over the course of several decades. Despite the mounting evidence against Savile, he was never brought to justice. He passed away in 2011, just a year before allegations of his sexual abuse began to surface. In the years since, many of his victims have spoken out, demanding justice for the crimes that were committed against them. For Brookes, justice may never truly be served. In a statement, she declared that she could never afford to compensate the BBC or anyone else connected with Savile's abuse. But by coming forward and sharing her story, she hopes to help prevent similar abuses from happening in the future. The case of Jimmy Savile is a troubling reminder of the power dynamics at play in cases of sexual abuse. Victims are often silenced by fear and shame, while abusers are able to operate with impunity due to their positions of authority.

On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a threeday march to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

On average, a professional football field measures 100 yards, endzone to endzone. Therefore, a touchdown is usually credited with 100 yards, even though the actual gain is usually much shorter. In the case of the two longest scoring touchdowns of a game, the yardage accumulated is usually significant. However, the answer to this question varies from game to game, depending on the teams, players, and strategies employed. To determine the yardage accumulated on the two longest scoring touchdowns of a game, one usually needs to review the game's statistics or watch a recap or highlight of the game. The statistics will usually include the length of each touchdown pass or run, which can be used to calculate the total yardage. For example, in a recent NFL game, the two longest scoring touchdowns were a 60-yard pass and a 75-yard run. Therefore, the total yardage accumulated on the two longest scoring touchdowns of the game was 135 yards. In summary, the yardage accumulated on the two longest scoring touchdowns of a game is an important statistic for anyone interested in football.

One way to achieve this is by adding a waist casing. Here's how you can do it: First, cut a strip of fabric that's 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the circumference of your waistline. The width of the strip can vary depending on your preference, but typically it's around 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Next, mark the waistline on your dress with a removable fabric marker or chalk. The waist casing should be pinned just below this line. Make sure the casing is centered and straight before pinning. Once the casing is pinned in place, sew it onto the dress using a straight stitch. You can use a sewing machine or hand stitch it. Be careful not to sew over the pins, and remove them as you go. After the casing is securely sewn, you can insert elastic or a drawstring into it to cinch the waistline. Alternatively, you can leave the casing empty and use a belt to define the waist. Adding a waist casing can give your dress a more polished look and provide a comfortable fit. With these simple steps, you can easily create a waist casing on your own."},{"instruction":"Premise: Revealed Clinton family troubles immediately after his pastoral visit.

The origins of the \\"Culture Wars\\" as we know them today can be situated around August 1914, according to Frank Furedi. This was the time when many intellectuals began to question the moral and cultural foundations of Western civilization. The horrors of the First World War led many to question the values and beliefs that had underpinned Western society for centuries. Today, we see young Muslims embracing a call to arms for a war of cultures. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the proliferation of extremist groups such as ISIS can be seen as a response to perceived Western cultural imperialism. Young Muslims are rejecting the values and beliefs of the West and instead embracing a more traditional, conservative interpretation of Islam. In conclusion, the period between 1914-1945 was a time of great upheaval and conflict, which gave way to the Cold War and the \\"Culture Wars.\\" The rise of Islamic fundamentalism can be seen as a response to perceived Western cultural imperialism, and it remains to be seen how this conflict will play out in the years to come."},{"instruction":"Select the topic that this about: BERLIN, Germany Brazilianborn striker Kevin Kuranyi scored the equalizer to earn Germany a 11 draw with Brazil in a friendly in Berlin, that was a rematch of their 2002 World Cup final.

If you're a beginner, it's better to start with a student violin, which is designed to be affordable and easy to play. As you become more skilled, you may want to upgrade to an intermediate violin, which offers better quality and sound. Advanced violinists, on the other hand, require a professional-grade instrument to really showcase their skills. These violins are made of high-quality materials and are designed for optimal sound production. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced violinist, it's important to choose an instrument that suits your needs and skill level. Another factor to consider is the style of music you want to play. Acoustic violins are great for classical and folk music, but if you're interested in playing rock or jazz, an electric violin may be a better option. Electric violins have a sharper, more modern sound that can be amplified, making them ideal for playing in live performances or recording studios. If you're not sure which violin is right for you, it's worth considering a rent-to-buy program. These programs allow you to rent a violin for a set period of time and then purchase it outright if you're happy with the instrument. This can be a great way to try out different types of violins and find the one that best suits your needs. In conclusion, when buying a violin, it's important to think about your skill level, the style of music you want to play, and whether or not a rent-to-buy program might be a good option. With these factors in mind, you can make an informed decision and find the perfect violin to help you achieve your musical goals."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve 343*t = 336*t 21 for t.

Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an overlayer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellowgreen light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.

The incident, which took place in a forest reserve, highlights the brutal nature of animal conflicts in the wild. Reports suggest that the brawl between the bull and cow was caused by a territorial dispute or a competition for resources such as food or water. Although such conflicts are not uncommon in the animal kingdom, it is a rare sight for humans to witness them firsthand. The incident also sheds light on the intensity of fights between animals. Elephants, for example, are known to engage in violent conflicts. However, what is interesting is that fights between male and female elephants are comparatively rare. This could be because male elephants are more focussed on competing with other males for mating rights. It is worth noting that while watching animals fight each other may be fascinating, it is crucial to remember that these are wild animals and must be treated with caution and respect. The savage jungle brawl in Assam serves as a reminder that as humans, we must not interfere in the natural course of things in the animal kingdom, but instead ensure that we protect their habitats and ensure their conservation."},{"instruction":"John Robert Gamble (born 1948) is a former professional baseball shortstop.

This type of symbiosis is relatively uncommon in rudimentary reference texts, but is omnipresent in the natural world.[citation needed] There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis. Competition is where a larger or stronger organisms deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. Antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism.[citation needed] An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone.","output":"The title of this article is \\"Amensalism: A Type of Symbiosis Where One Organism is Inhibited or Destroyed While the Other is Unaffected\\"."},{"instruction":"Table5.1.CalculatedtotalNloss,NH3emissionsandNaccessibleforpercolationinDenmarkatdifferenthallarrangementsseeninanoverallperspective(hall,warehouse,field),tons1999.Nlosstotal,tonsNH3,tonsNaccessibleforpercolation,tonsA.Hallwithtroughsandweeklycleanout6,2563,2292,755B.Hallwithtroughsanddailyautomaticcleanout5,7502,3782,949C.Hallwithouttroughsandwithweeklycleanout(20%percolationinhallassumed)7,5133,7363,113C3.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.
