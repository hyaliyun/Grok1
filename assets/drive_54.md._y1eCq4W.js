Now that you have Ubuntu installed through WSL2 and it's all set up, you'll need to mount your Windows directory in Ubuntu to access your Quantum ESPRESSO files. Here's how to do it: # Access Windows Filesystem from WSL2: Within WSL2, your Windows filesystem is typically accessible through the \`/mnt/\` directory, with each drive mounted under its corresponding letter. For example, the \`C:\` drive is usually mounted at \`/mnt/c/\`. If your Quantum ESPRESSO directory is on your \`C:\` drive, you can access it by navigating to \`/mnt/c/\` followed by the path to where you have your Quantum ESPRESSO directory. # Mount and Access Directory: 1. Open the Ubuntu terminal in WSL2. 2. Navigate to the mount point for the drive that contains your Quantum ESPRESSO directory. For example: \`\`\`bash cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/path/to/quantum-espresso \`\`\` Replace \`YourUsername\` with your actual Windows username, and the rest of the path with the path to where your Quantum ESPRESSO directory is located. 3. Once you are in the directory, you can list the files to make sure you're in the right place: \`\`\`bash ls \`\`\` # Build Quantum ESPRESSO: Before using the \`make all\` command to compile Quantum ESPRESSO, you'll need to ensure you have the required dependencies and compilers installed on your WSL2 Ubuntu system. 1. Install necessary build tools and libraries: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt install -y build-essential mpi-default-dev mpi-default-bin libfftw3-dev \`\`\` This installs the build essentials, MPI libraries, and FFTW3 libraries, which are often required for building Quantum ESPRESSO. 2. Configure your environment for Quantum ESPRESSO: This step typically involves setting environment variables or editing makefiles to match your system architecture and desired optimization. Follow the Quantum ESPRESSO documentation or specific instructions provided for your version. 3. To compile Quantum ESPRESSO, you can run the following command from within the root of the Quantum ESPRESSO source directory: \`\`\`bash make all \`\`\` This command compiles all the necessary binaries and may take some time to complete depending on your system's performance. # Troubleshooting: - If you run into any compilation errors, they are often due to missing dependencies or misconfigured settings. - Ensure that you've correctly installed all the necessary compilers and libraries. - Check the \`make.inc\` file or other configuration files provided by Quantum ESPRESSO for any system-specific settings you need to modify. - Consult the Quantum ESPRESSO user forums or mailing lists for support if you encounter specific error messages. Once the compilation is finished, you should have all the Quantum ESPRESSO binaries ready to use within your Ubuntu environment on WSL2."},{"instruction":"its having lots of mismatch errors , i dont know if it will self fix it all , hmmm lets wait and see","output":"If you're encountering mismatch errors during the compilation process, it's unlikely that they will resolve themselves without intervention. Compilation errors usually require troubleshooting to identify and fix the underlying problem. The errors may stem from several potential issues like missing dependencies, incompatible library versions, incorrect environment configuration, or issues specific to the Quantum ESPRESSO codebase and how it interacts with your system. Here is a general approach to troubleshooting these errors: 1. **Read the Error Messages**: Start by carefully reading the compiler's output to identify which files or lines of code are causing errors. Sometimes the message will give you a clear indication of what is missing or what went wrong. 2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies for building Quantum ESPRESSO are correctly installed. This typically includes compilers (\`gcc\`, \`gfortran\`), MPI libraries, and mathematical libraries (such as FFTW, BLAS, LAPACK). 3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that environment variables are correctly set. For MPI and libraries, you may need to set \`PATH\`, \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`, and other variables that help the compiler find the right files. 4. **Modify Makefile**: For Quantum ESPRESSO, you may need to create or edit a \`make.inc\` file specific to your environment. Check the examples provided with the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution to guide you. 5. **Check Quantum ESPRESSO Versions**: Ensure that you are using a version of Quantum ESPRESSO that is compatible with your system and libraries. Sometimes, using the latest version or a stable release can avoid issues found in older versions. 6. **Use Provided Configurations**: Quantum ESPRESSO usually comes with example configurations for different architectures in the \`install/\` directory. Use these as a starting point. 7. **Seek Help from the Community**: If you're unable to resolve the issues by yourself, consider seeking help from the Quantum ESPRESSO community. The user mailing list, forums, or even Stack Overflow can be good places to ask for help. Be sure to provide detailed information and error messages to get the most accurate assistance. 8. **Clean Build**: Before trying to compile again after making changes, it's a good practice to clean the previous build attempts to start from a fresh state. You can typically do this with: \`\`\`bash make clean \`\`\` 9. **Document Each Step**: Keep track of the changes you make and the outcomes, so you can isolate which changes, if any, resolve the issues. To get a more specific solution, please copy and paste the exact error messages you are seeing, and I can help you troubleshoot more effectively."},{"instruction":"fallow argument mismatch seems to be the main thing","output":"An \\"argument mismatch\\" error during compilation typically indicates that there is a conflict between the expected data types, dimensions, or number of arguments of a subroutine or function call within the code. These mismatches are often due to inconsistencies between the code and the libraries or compilers being used. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve \\"argument mismatch\\" errors: 1. **Check Compiler Versions**: Make sure you are using a compatible Fortran compiler version for Quantum ESPRESSO. Some compilers are stricter than others regarding argument matching, especially with newer standards. 2. **Examine the Error Log**: Look closely at the error log to determine which functions or subroutines are causing the mismatch. If the error mentions a specific library function (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK, or MPI), make sure you're linking against the correct version of the library that matches the interface used in Quantum ESPRESSO. 3. **Fortran Standards**: Quantum ESPRESSO is written in Fortran, and argument mismatches could occur if the compiler is enforcing a different Fortran standard than expected. You can specify the Fortran standard using compiler flags (e.g., \`-std=f2008\`, \`-std=f95\`) in the \`make\` configuration file (\`make.inc\`). 4. **Check for Implicit Interfaces**: Fortran's implicit interfaces can lead to argument mismatches. Ensure that all libraries are compiled with the appropriate interfaces, or use interface blocks or modules in Quantum ESPRESSO's source code to define explicit interfaces. 5. **Review Customizations**: If you have customized any part of Quantum ESPRESSO's code or the build system, revisit your changes to make sure they align with the expected function or subroutine signatures. 6. **Dependencies and Modules**: Verify that all necessary modules are loaded if you're in an environment that uses modules, like on an HPC cluster. Sometimes mismatches can occur when the wrong module versions are loaded. 7. **Update or Downgrade**: If you're using a development version of Quantum ESPRESSO, consider switching to a stable release to see if the problem persists. Conversely, if you're using an older release, updating to a newer version may resolve compatibility issues with modern compilers or libraries. To correct the issue, you may need to adjust your compilation flags or environment modules to ensure you're using compatible versions of compilers and libraries. If possible, extract and share the specific error message along with a few lines around where the error occurs in the code. This information can provide valuable context for identifying the source of the mismatch. If you continue to face these issues, consider reaching out to the Quantum ESPRESSO community for detailed support, as mentioned earlier."},{"instruction":"well we installed the fortran compiler using powershell as admin , but i wonder if it needs to be done seperatley for ubuntu ?","output":"Yes, installing the Fortran compiler in PowerShell as an administrator installs it for Windows and not for the Ubuntu subsystem you're using with WSL2. In the context of WSL2, you will need to install the Fortran compiler and any other required dependencies within the Ubuntu environment separately. To install the GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran), which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) in Ubuntu on WSL2, you can use the following command in your Ubuntu terminal: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt install -y gfortran \`\`\` This command will download and install the latest version of \`gfortran\` available from the Ubuntu repositories. In addition to \`gfortran\`, you may also need to install other tools and libraries that are prerequisites for compiling Quantum ESPRESSO. Common requirements include MPI (for parallel execution) and mathematical libraries such as BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW: \`\`\`bash sudo apt install -y libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin libblas-dev liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev \`\`\` Note: When installing packages in Ubuntu within WSL2, you do not need to use PowerShell or run commands as an administrator. The \`sudo\` command in the Ubuntu terminal is used to execute commands with administrative privileges within the Linux environment. The mentioned \`apt\` commands ensure that you're using the compatible versions of compilers and libraries within the WSL2 Ubuntu system to prevent issues such as the \\"argument mismatch\\" error you encountered earlier.

爸爸在旁边教我怎么用小网捞鱼。我学着爸爸的样子，假装很有经验似的，左手拿着小桶，右手轻轻地在水里晃动小网。我小心翼翼地盯着水面，生怕错过任何抓鱼的机会。 突然，我看见一条大鱼朝我游来，心里那个激动啊，连忙屏住呼吸，慢慢地、慢慢地接近它。就在它马上要游到小网旁边时，我猛地一网下去，但是还是没捞到。我有点小失望，不过爸爸鼓励我说：“没关系，再试试，慢慢来。”我点点头，心想这次一定要捞到。 过了一会儿，又有一条小鱼游到了我面前，这次我稳住呼吸，慢慢地靠近它...“嘭”的一声，小鱼稳稳当当地进了我的小网。我抬起网，看到那条可爱的小鱼在网里扑腾，我那个开心啊，就像过了年一样。 “爸爸，我抓到鱼了！”我兴奋地大叫，声音里全是高兴和自豪。爸爸快步走过来，笑着摸摸我的头，说：“真棒，咱们的小渔夫长大了！”我骄傲地把小鱼放进桶里，一边看着它游来游去，一边忍不住咧嘴笑。 太阳慢慢地西下，我们也收拾东西准备回家。虽然今天只捉到两条小鱼，但这个抓鱼之旅真是太有意思了，我觉得超级高兴，这一天肯定会成为我最难忘的回忆之一。"},{"instruction":"请换一个主题，围绕打雪仗来写吧","output":"寒假来临了，天空飘洒着轻柔的大雪，铺满了整个小镇。一早醒来，我透过窗户看到外面变成了一个晶莹剔透的白色世界。我迫不及待地穿上了厚厚的棉衣，戴上帽子和手套，准备和小伙伴们去打雪仗。 走出家门，冷风呼啦啦地拍在脸上，雪花像棉花糖一样软软地落在我手上。我先是在家门前堆了一个小雪人，用两颗煤球做眼睛，胡萝卜做鼻子，一个小雪人就这样活泼地站在那儿。 不一会儿，我的好朋友小明和小红也来了，他们身上穿着五颜六色的棉服，像两个活泼的彩色小球。我们互相打招呼后就迫不及待地开始了雪仗。我俯下身子，双手捏起一团雪，使劲揉成了一个雪球。雪球又圆又滑，我瞄准小明，一扔过去，\\"嘻嘻\\"地笑着。雪球准确地击中了小明的肩膀，他装作一副被击倒的模样，我们都笑成了一团。 小明也不示弱，立刻堆起一堆雪球，向我和小红发起了反击。雪花飞舞、笑声连连，我们彼此追着跑，扔着雪球。我甚至还摔了一跤，坐在雪地里，一边笑一边打滚。冰冷的雪下的我感到一阵刺激，脸颊被冻得通红，但是心里却暖暖的，好开心。 我们玩了好久，直到感到有些疲倦又饿了，才依依不舍地结束了这场雪地大战。妈妈在家已经准备好了热腾腾的热可可和点心，我们围坐在热气腾腾的桌子边，边喝边聊。我的心里，又甜又暖，感觉今年的冬天真的特别特别的快乐。 虽然外面的世界还在下着雪，但是我们的心中都存着那场雪仗的快乐记忆，那真是一个难忘又快乐的午后。"},{"instruction":"谢谢！","output":"不客气！如果你还有其他问题或需要帮助，随时告诉我。祝你有一个美好的一天！"},{"instruction":"请围绕“在北京欢乐谷玩得真高兴”，包含两个项目：激流勇进和丛林小火车（丛林过山车），创作一个三年级的学生的作文，不少于300字。要求：1、写清楚玩的过程，2、表达出当时高兴的心情；3、有心理、动作、语言、神态的描述，突出细节。","output":"上个周末，爸爸妈妈带我去了北京欢乐谷。那里的每个角落都充满了欢声笑语，我玩得特别开心，尤其是在“激流勇进”和“丛林过山车”两个项目上的经历最让我兴奋不已。 早上我们刚到欢乐谷，我就迫不及待地拉着爸爸的手往“激流勇进”冲。我看到人工河道的水花溅起好高好高，我的心也跟着“扑通扑通”地跳。戴上救生衣，我们坐上了圆形的橡皮艇，艇子随着湍急的河水摇摇晃晃地前进。忽然一股巨浪打来，水花溅得我们全身湿透，我尖叫一声，既紧张又刺激。但看到爸爸妈妈也笑成一团，我就不害怕了，反而觉得好玩极了。 我们的衣服还没干，就来到了“丛林过山车”。我第一次坐过山车，心里有点忐忑。但一想到丛林探险，我就兴奋起来。过山车缓缓地爬升，越来越高，我紧紧抓着扶手，小声地跟妈妈说：“咱们快飞起来了！”就在车子冲上最高点，我的心跟着一起“咻”地飞了出去。车子急速下坠，我的头发都飞到了天上，我闭着眼睛，大声尖叫，尖叫声中夹杂着欢笑。当车子平稳时，我睁开眼，看着周围的小伙伴们，我们互相笑着，好像都成了丛林小勇士。 玩完这两个项目，我的脸颊上红扑扑的，眼睛里充满了光彩。拍拍我的肩膀，我得意地对爸爸妈妈说：“今天真是最好玩的一天！”爸爸妈妈也哈哈大笑，和我一样高兴。 晚上，虽然家里的小床上没有激流勇进的水花，也没有丛林过山车的急速飞驰，但我的梦里，我还在欢乐谷里尽情地玩耍。那一天，我在欢乐谷玩得真的非常非常高兴。"},{"instruction":"请围绕“北京欢乐谷愉快的一天”，创作一个三年级的学生的作文，不少于300字。要求：1、写清楚玩的过程，2、表达出当时高兴的心情；3、有心理、动作、语言、神态的描述，突出细节，4、详细写两个项目：激流勇进和丛林小火车（丛林过山车），详细描述玩得过程、开心心情，5，略写一些其他的项目，一两句话描述就可以。","output":"上星期六，天空湛蓝得像一块宝石，我和爸爸妈妈一起去了北京欢乐谷。那里灯光闪烁，音乐欢快，好像每个人的笑容都比太阳还要亮堂。我在心里默默许下愿望：希望今天能玩得特别开心！ 我们首先去了“激流勇进”，我从来没试过这么刺激的游戏。站在高高的平台上，我能听到水流的咆哮声，我的心蹦蹦跳，好像要从嗓子眼儿跳出来。但当我和爸爸妈妈坐在圆形橡皮船上，顺着急流冲下去时，我感到既害怕又兴奋。水花四溅，溅到我脸上，冷冰冰的，我忍不住尖叫起来。等到终于稳稳地滑到水道的尽头，我简直不相信自己真的做到了！我大声喊着：“太好玩了，我还想玩！”我看到爸爸妈妈也激动地笑着，我就知道他们也很高兴。 接下来，我们去挑战了“丛林过山车”。我坐在小火车的车厢里，双手紧紧抓住前面的把手。随着过山车一点点往上爬，我好奇地向外张望，对妈妈说：“我们好像在丛林探险哦！”然后，车子“呼啦”一声就冲下去了，风在耳边呼啸。我感到好像飞起来了一样，那一刻我只能感受到我的心跳声和尖叫声。过山车停下来后，我的腿有点软，但我仍然情不自禁地笑出声，和其他的小朋友一样，我觉得这简直太好玩了！ 除了这两个项目，我们还玩了旋转木马和碰碰车，也都非常有趣。我骑在旋转木马上，感觉自己像个骑士，碰碰车则让我笑个不停。 那一天晚上，我躺在床上，头脑里满是欢乐谷的点点滴滴，脸上仍然挂着白天的那股喜悦。我对爸爸妈妈说：“今天是我最快乐的一天！”而我相信，这一天的记忆会像欢乐谷里的魔法一样，在我的心里永远闪亮。"},{"instruction":"translate to

― 맞습니다. 이대로 전반전이 끝나면 아스널은 2차전에서도 힘들어질 수밖에 없으니까요. 어떻게든 한 골이라도 넣을 필요가 있습니다! 해설의 말처럼 아스널의 분위기는 최악이었다. 선수들과 팬들 모두 전반전에만 3골을 허용했다는 것에 큰 충격을 받았다. 특히 아스널의 팬들은 그들의 눈앞에 벌어진 상황을 믿기 힘들어했다. “말도 안 돼……!” “아스널이……이렇게 당한다고?” “바이에른 뮌헨이랑 실력 차이가 이렇게나 클 줄이야…….” “바이에른 뮌헨의 스트라이커를 전혀 못 막고 있잖아……?” “뮌헨의 스트라이커가 너무 잘해……!” 같은 시각. 분데스리가를 거의 보지 않고, 프리미어리그만을 즐겨보던 전 세계 축구팬들도 신재욱의 실력에 큰 충격을 받았다. └ 대박! 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격수 뭐야? 왜 저렇게 잘해? └ 분데스리가의 득점왕이래. 나도 오늘 경기는 처음 봤는데, 되게 잘한다. 아스널의 수비수들이 전혀 막질 못하고 있잖아? └ 저 한국인 공격수는 이번 경기가 끝나고 나면 전 세계적으로 관심을 받게 될 거야. └ 내가 분데스리가를 챙겨보진 않지만, 신재욱이 이미 전 세계적으로 관심받고 있던 선수라는 건 알고 있어. 쟨 이미 여러 빅클럽의 러브콜을 받는 선수야. └ 신재욱 너무 잘하는데? 알아보니까 지난 시즌 분데스리가 득점왕이고, 이번 시즌도 득점왕이 유력한 선수네! └ 놀라운 건 이 선수의 나이가 18세라는 거야!!! 다들 믿어져? 얘 겨우 18살이라고!! └ 아스널 수비가 이렇게나 약했나? 이번 시즌엔 꽤 단단하지 않았어? └ 바이에른 뮌헨이 아스널의 수비를 약해 보이게 만들고 있는 거야. 그만큼 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격이 날카롭다는 거지. └ 신재욱 쟤가 18살이라고? 움직임이 어떻게 저렇게나 좋을 수가 있지? 오프더볼 움직임과 온더볼 움직임이 모두 환상적이야! 그리고 몸싸움도 꽤 강해 보여! └ 공중볼 경합에서도 잘 안 밀리고, 공을 잘 따내고 있어! 아스널의 수비수들이 신재욱보다 키가 더 큰데도 말이야! └ 바이에른 뮌헨에 저런 스트라이커가 있었다니……! 이처럼 모두가 충격에 빠진 상황에서. 전반전이 종료됐다. 이후, 후반전의 흐름도 바이에른 뮌헨이 끌고 갔다. 3점 차로 앞서가고 있기에, 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들의 플레이엔 자신감이 흘러나왔다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 선수들은 방심도 하지 않았다. 완벽주의자인 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 차가운 눈으로 경기를 지켜보고 있었으니까. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 후반전에도 아스널을 강하게 압박하는 전술을 펼치네요! 이러면 체력이 많이 소모될 텐데, 그만큼 스쿼드에 여유가 있다는 거겠죠! 언제든지 새로운 카드를 꺼낼 수 있는 바이에른 뮌헨입니다! ― 그에 비해서 현재 아스널은 스쿼드가 탄탄한 편은 아니라서 체력적인 문제를 드러내고 있습니다. 프리미어리그에서도 순위경쟁을 하느라 주전선수들 위주로 경기를 치러왔지 않습니까? 주전선수들의 체력이 정상일 수가 없습니다. ― 1차전에서 아스널이 이렇게 무너지나요? 프리미어리그를 즐겨보시는 팬분들에겐 너무나도 충격적인 경기 내용일 것 같네요! 아스널은 골을 넣어야만 하는 상황이었다. 3 대 0으로 밀리고 있었으니까. 이대로라면 2차전이 힘들어질 테니까. 그러나 이들은 적극적으로 공격하지 못했다. ― 오우! 아스널의 슈체스니 골키퍼가 토니 크로스의 슈팅을 막아냈습니다! 이야~! 정말 잘 때린 슈팅이었는데, 이게 골키퍼 정면으로 향하네요! ― 아스널이 마음은 급한데, 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격을 막느라 제대로 된 공격을 하지 못하고 있습니다! 시간은 자꾸 흐르고, 아스널 선수들의 마음은 점점 더 급해질 것 같습니다! 오히려 더 적극적으로 공격하는 팀은 바이에른 뮌헨이었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들의 컨디션이 굉장히 좋아 보이네요! 교체 카드를 아끼지 않는 과르디올라 감독의 판단도 효과적이고요! 그래서일까? 후반 30분, 골을 넣은 팀은 아스널이 아닌 바이에른 뮌헨이었다. ― 토마스 뮐러입니다! 슈체스니 골키퍼가 튕겨낸 공을 그대로 골로 연결했습니다! 위치선정이 대단히 좋았기에 나온 골이네요! ― 토마스 뮐러 선수는 이런 골을 굉장히 잘 넣는 선수죠! 바이에른 뮌헨의 공세는 경기가 끝날 때까지 이어졌다. 아스널은 골을 노리긴커녕 수비에만 급급한 채, 시간을 보냈다. 삐이이이익! ― 경기 종료됩니다! 바이에른 뮌헨이 챔피언스리그 16강 1차전에서 아스널을 상대로 4 대 0 대승을 거뒀습니다! * * * 아스널과의 경기가 끝난 이후. 신재욱의 이름은 더욱 유명해졌다. 분데스리가를 챙겨보는 팬이 아니라면 잘 알지 못했었는데, 이제는 세계적으로 유명한 선수가 됐다. 좋은 활약도 계속 이어졌다. 「신재욱, 샬케와의 경기에서 해트트릭! 현재 리그 3위인 샬케의 수비도 천재 스트라이커를 막는 건 역부족!」 「압도적 리그 득점 1위 달리는 신재욱, 이번 시즌 몇 골이나 넣을까?」 「신재욱, 리그 50골 노리나?」 매 경기 선발로 출전해서 활약하는 신재욱을 중심으로 바이에른 뮌헨은 연승을 이어갔다. 신재욱은 그런 상황에서 한국대표팀 경기까지 치르며 바쁜 일정을 소화했다. 그리고 2014년 3월 중순이 됐을 때. 바이에른 뮌헨은 다시 아스널을 만났다. 챔피언스리그 16강 2차전이었다. 아스널은 지난 1차전에서 겪은 굴욕적인 패배를 갚아주기 위해 최선을 다했다. 그러나 리그에서도 연승을 이어가며 기세가 오를 대로 오른 바이에른 뮌헨을 꺾어내진 못했다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 챔피언스리그 8강 진출! 16강 2차전에서도 아스널 꺾었다!」 「챔피언스리그의 유력한 우승 후보 바이에른 뮌헨, 8강에선 어떤 경기력 보여줄까?」 강력한 경기력으로 8강에 오른 바이에른 뮌헨. 지지 않을 것만 같은 기세를 내뿜는 이 팀은 분데스리가에서도 계속 연승을 이어갔다. 리그 27연승을 이어가며 독일 최고의 팀다운 경기력을 보여줬다. 그러나 28라운드 경기에선 위기를 맞았다. 며칠 뒤에 있을 챔피언스리그 8강 1차전을 위해서 핵심 선수를 출전시키지 않은 바이에른 뮌헨은 호펜하임을 상대로 좋지 못한 경기력을 보였다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 리그에서 이렇게까지 밀렸던 경기가 있었나요? 적어도 이번 시즌엔 없었던 것 같은데요? ― 이번 시즌의 바이에른 뮌헨은 27연승을 할 때까지 별다른 위기가 없었죠! 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 챔피언스리그에 너무 신경을 많이 쓴 것일까요? 주전선수가 대거 빠진 바이에른 뮌헨의 경기력은 너무 아쉽네요! ― 특히 티아고 알칸타라 선수와 마리오 괴체 선수의 실전 감각이 떨어진 게 큰 것 같습니다. 오늘 바이에른 뮌헨의 전술은 이들이 잘해줘야만 하거든요? 하지만 토니 크로스 선수의 빈자리가 너무도 크게 느껴집니다. ― 공격진도 마찬가지입니다. 피사로 선수가 좋은 움직임을 보여주고 있고 골도 기록했지만, 신재욱 선수가 뛸 때에 비하면 확실히 무게감이 떨어지는 게 사실입니다. 후반 17분. 바이에른 뮌헨은 호펜하임에게 2 대 3으로 밀리고 있었다. 이때, 호셉 과르디올라는 어쩔 수 없다는 표정으로 교체 카드를 사용했다. 교체 카드 2장을 한 번에 사용하며 아르연 로번과 신재욱을 동시에 투입하는 판단을 내렸다. 그 모습을 보며 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들은 불만을 드러냈다. “망할 과르디올라! 신재욱을 왜 이제야 투입하는 거야? 더 빨리 넣었어야지!” “신재욱을 선발로 출전시켰으면 이런 상황이 만들어지지도 않았을 거야.” “챔피언스리그를 위해서 선수들 체력을 아끼는 건 좋은데, 이건 너무 심하잖아! 주전선수들을 너무 많이 빼서 경기력이 쓰레기가 됐다고!” “참 빨리도 넣는다! 로번은 몰라도 신재욱은 더 빨리 넣었어야지!” 신재욱을 너무 늦게 투입했다는 것에 대한 불만이었다. 그러나 경기장에 들어온 당사자는 아무런 불만이 없었다. ‘후반 17분이네? 이 정도 시간이면 충분히 역전할 수 있어.’ 신재욱은 미소를 지었다. 누군가에겐 부족하게 느껴지는 시간이겠지만, 그에겐 아니었다. 컨디션도 좋았고 상대인 호펜하임에 대한 분석도 달달 외울 정도로 해놓은 상태였기에, 언제든지 골을 넣을 수 있다는 자신감이 있었다. 그때였다. “재욱! 우린 너만 믿고 있어! 네가 골을 넣을 거라고 믿어!” “시이이이이인! 째욱! 팀을 구해줘!” “재우우욱! 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커의 실력을 호펜하임에게 보여줘!” “제발 이겨줘! 재욱! 믿을 건 너밖에 없어!” 관중석에 있는 팬들의 간절한 목소리가 들렸다. ‘당연히 이겨드려야지.’ 신재욱은 그런 팬들을 향해 엄지를 들어 올렸다. 전혀 걱정할 필요가 없다는 의미를 담은 행동이었다. 그 즉시 경기장에 함성이 터져 나왔다. 우와아아아아! 신재욱을 향한 함성이었다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들은 신재욱의 이름을 부르며 경기장의 분위기를 뜨겁게 달궜다. ― 신재욱 선수가 들어오면서부터 분위기가 달라졌습니다! 오오오! 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들이 신재욱 선수의 이름을 외치고 있습니다! 팬들의 기대를 받는 상황. 그런 상황에서 신재욱이 움직였다. 공이 없을 땐 최전방에선 압박을 펼쳤고, 공을 잡으면 그 누구보다도 위협적인 플레이로 기회를 만들어냈다. 그리고 그 결과. 신재욱은 팬들이 미친 듯 흥분할 수밖에 없는 일을 해냈다. ― 동점 골입니다! 신재욱이 동점 골을 기록했습니다! 이제 스코어는 3 대 3이 됐습니다! ― 정말 놀랍네요! 신재욱 선수! 들어온 지 얼마나 됐다고 벌써 골을 넣나요?! 경기장에 있는 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들이 흥분하고 있습니다! 후반 34분, 세트피스 상황에서 헤더로 동점 골을 기록했고. ― 우와아아아아! 고오오오오올! 신재욱의 골입니다! 역전입니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 스트라이커 신재욱이 역전 골을 터트리며 4 대 3 스코어를 만들어냈습니다! ― 이게 말이 되나요? 신재욱 선수가 후반전 조커로 들어와서 팀을 구해냈습니다! 후반 45분, 신재욱이 또다시 골을 터트리며 스코어를 4 대 3으로 만들었다. 이후 추가시간이 빠르게 흘렀고, 경기는 바이에른 뮌헨의 역전승으로 끝이 났다. 그리고 며칠 뒤. 바이에른 뮌헨이 챔피언스리그 8강에서 만나게 될 상대가 결정됐다. 「바이에른 뮌헨 vs 맨체스터 유나이티드! 챔피언스리그 8강에서 만난다!」","output":"169 --- A one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper. It was a situation where the striker had to win. Naturally, it was bound to be nerve-wracking. But for Shin Jaewook, there was an air of composure. He was so composed that he could even see the surprised expressions of the Arsenal FC fans in the stands. 'It's too early to be surprised.' The corners of Shin Jaewook's mouth lifted. He felt the urge to surprise the opposing Arsenal fans even more. He also had the confidence to do so. But first, there was something he had to do. 'Let's put this one in first.' Shin Jaewook swung his leg. He kicked the ball precisely, aiming for the corner of Arsenal's goal. ― It's a hat-trick! Shin Jaewook has scored a hat-trick in the Champions League! ― From breaking into the open space to his first touch and beating the defenders to score, it was all perfect! Shin Jaewook! Truly the best striker in the Bundesliga! He's scoring against Arsenal with ease! ― This must be the worst first half for Arsenal, right? ― That's right. If the first half ends like this, Arsenal will have a tough time in the second leg as well. They need to score at least one goal! As the commentator said, the atmosphere at Arsenal was the worst. Both the players and the fans were shocked to have conceded three goals in the first half alone. Especially the Arsenal fans found it hard to believe what was happening right before their eyes. \\"It's unbelievable...!\\" \\"Arsenal... to be beaten like this?\\" \\"The skill gap with Bayern Munich is this big...?\\" \\"They can't stop Bayern Munich's striker at all...?\\" \\"Munich's striker is playing too well...!\\" At the same time. Football fans around the world who hardly watched the Bundesliga and only enjoyed the Premier League were also shocked by Shin Jaewook's skills. └ Wow! Who is this Bayern Munich forward? Why is he so good? └ He's the top scorer in the Bundesliga. I watched the game for the first time today, and he's really good. Arsenal's defenders can't stop him at all, can they? └ This Korean forward will receive worldwide attention after this game. └ I don't follow the Bundesliga, but I knew that Shin Jaewook was already a player receiving attention worldwide. He's already been courted by several big clubs. └ Shin Jaewook is playing so well? I found out he was the top scorer in the Bundesliga last season, and he's likely to be this season too! └ What's amazing is that this player is only 18 years old!!! Can you believe it? He's just 18! └ Was Arsenal's defense this weak? Weren't they quite solid this season? └ It's Bayern Munich that's making Arsenal's defense look weak. It just shows how sharp Bayern Munich's attack is. └ Shin Jaewook is 18 years old? How can his movement be so good? Both his off-the-ball and on-the-ball movements are fantastic! And he seems quite strong in physical battles too! └ He's not easily pushed around in aerial duels, and he's good at winning the ball! Even though Arsenal's defenders are taller than Shin Jaewook! └ I had no idea Bayern Munich had such a striker...! In such a shocking situation for everyone. The first half ended. In the second half, Bayern Munich continued to lead the game. With a three-goal lead, the Bayern Munich players played with confidence. The Bayern Munich players did not become complacent. Especially since perfectionist coach Josep Guardiola was watching the game with a cold eye. ― Bayern Munich is continuing to press Arsenal strongly in the second half! This will consume a lot of stamina, but it shows they have depth in their squad! Bayern Munich can always bring out a new card! ― On the other hand, Arsenal's squad isn't as solid, so they're showing physical problems. Haven't they been playing with their main players in the Premier League to compete in the rankings? It's impossible for the main players to be at their best. ― Is Arsenal collapsing like this in the first leg? For fans who enjoy watching the Premier League, this must be a shockingly disappointing game! Arsenal was in a situation where they had to score. They were trailing 3 to 0. If it stayed like this, the second leg would be difficult. However, they couldn't attack aggressively. ― Oh! Arsenal's goalkeeper Szczesny has saved Toni Kroos' shot! Wow! It was a really well-struck shot, but it went straight to the goalkeeper! ― Arsenal is in a hurry, but they can't launch a proper attack because they're busy stopping Bayern Munich's offense! Time is passing, and the Arsenal players are becoming more anxious! Instead, the team that was more aggressive in their attack was Bayern Munich. ― The condition of Bayern Munich's players looks very good! Coach Guardiola's decision to not spare any substitute cards is also effective! Perhaps because of that? In the 30th minute of the second half, the team that scored was not Arsenal but Bayern Munich. ― It's Thomas Müller! He connected the ball rebounded by goalkeeper Szczesny straight into the goal! It was a goal that came from excellent positioning! ― Thomas Müller is a player who is very good at scoring such goals! Bayern Munich's offensive continued until the end of the game. Arsenal, instead of aiming for a goal, spent time desperately defending. Whistle! ― The game ends! Bayern Munich has won a big victory over Arsenal with a 4 to 0 in the first leg of the Champions League Round of 16! --- After the game against Arsenal. Shin Jaewook's name became even more famous. He was not well known to fans who followed the Bundesliga, but now he had become a world-famous player. His good performances continued. 「Shin Jaewook scores a hat-trick in the game against Schalke! The defense of Schalke, currently third in the league, is no match for the genius striker!」 「Shin Jaewook, who is overwhelmingly leading the league in scoring, how many goals will he score this season?」 「Shin Jaewook aiming for 50 league goals?」 Bayern Munich continued their winning streak with Shin Jaewook, who started every game and played actively. In the midst of such a situation, Shin Jaewook also played in the Korean national team matches, managing a busy schedule. And when it was mid-March 2014. Bayern Munich met Arsenal again. It was the second leg of the Champions League Round of 16. Arsenal did their best to avenge their humiliating defeat in the first leg. However, they could not defeat Bayern Munich, which had continued its winning streak in the league and was at the peak of its momentum. 「Bayern Munich advances to the Champions League quarter-finals! They defeated Arsenal again in the Round of 16 second leg!」 「Bayern Munich, a strong contender for the Champions League, what kind of performance will they show in the quarter-finals?」 Bayern Munich, with its powerful performance, advanced to the quarter-finals. This team, which seemed unstoppable, continued its winning streak in the Bundesliga as well. They showed their worth as Germany's best team by continuing a 27-game winning streak. However, they faced a crisis in the 28th round. Bayern Munich, which did not field key players in preparation for the Champions League quarter-final first leg a few days later, showed a poor performance against Hoffenheim. ― Has Bayern Munich ever been pushed this much in a league game? At least not this season, right? ― This season's Bayern Munich had no significant crisis until their 27-game winning streak! Did coach Josep Guardiola focus too much on the Champions League? It's disappointing to see Bayern Munich's performance without many of its main players! ― Especially Thiago Alcantara and Mario Götze seem to have lost their match sharpness. Today's tactics for Bayern Munich depend on them performing well. However, Toni Kroos' absence is sorely felt. ― The same goes for the attack. Pizarro is showing good movement and has scored, but it's true that there's less impact compared to when Shin Jaewook is playing. In the 17th minute of the second half. Bayern Munich was trailing Hoffenheim 2 to 3. At that moment, Josep Guardiola used a substitution card with a look of having no choice. He made the decision to bring in Arjen Robben and Shin Jaewook at the same time using two substitution cards. Seeing this, Bayern Munich's fans expressed their dissatisfaction. \\"Damn Guardiola! Why is he only bringing in Shin Jaewook now? He should have done it earlier!\\" \\"If Shin Jaewook had started, this situation wouldn't have happened.\\" \\"It's good to save the players' stamina for the Champions League, but this is too much! He took out too many main players, and the game quality has become trash!\\" \\"He's quick to make substitutions! I don't know about Robben, but Shin Jaewook should have been brought in earlier!\\" The fans were unhappy that Shin Jaewook was brought in too late. However, the player who entered the field had no complaints. 'It's the 17th minute of the second half? That's enough time to turn the game around.' Shin Jaewook smiled. It might seem like insufficient time to some, but not to him. His condition was good, and he had memorized the analysis of the opponent, Hoffenheim, so he was confident he could score at any time. That's when it happened. \\"Jaewook! We're only relying on you! We believe you'll score!\\" \\"Shiiiiiiin! Jaewook! Save the team!\\" \\"Jaewook! Show Hoffenheim the skills of the Bundesliga's best striker!\\" \\"Please win! Jaewook! You're the only one we can trust!\\" The desperate voices of the fans in the stands reached him. 'Of course, I have to win for them.' Shin Jaewook gave a thumbs-up to the fans. It was a gesture that meant there was no need to worry. Immediately, a roar erupted in the stadium. Wow! It was a cheer for Shin Jaewook. The fans of Bayern Munich chanted Shin Jaewook's name, heating up the atmosphere in the stadium. ― The atmosphere has changed since Shin Jaewook entered! Oh! The fans of Bayern Munich are chanting Shin Jaewook's name! In a situation where the fans had high expectations. In such a situation, Shin Jaewook moved. When he didn't have the ball, he pressed from the front, and when he got the ball, he created opportunities with plays more threatening than anyone else. And as a result. Shin Jaewook did something that made the fans go wild with excitement. ― It's an equalizing goal! Shin Jaewook has scored the equalizer! Now the score is 3 to 3! ― It's amazing! Shin Jaewook! How long has he been on the field to score already?! The fans of Bayern Munich in the stadium are excited! In the 34th minute of the second half, he scored a header from a set-piece situation to equalize. ― Wow! Gooooal! It's Shin Jaewook's goal! It's a comeback! Bayern Munich's striker Shin Jaewook has scored a comeback goal, making the score 4 to 3! ― Is this even possible? Shin Jaewook has come on as a second-half joker and saved the team! In the 45th minute of the second half, Shin Jaewook scored again, making the score 4 to 3. After that, the added time passed quickly, and the game ended with a comeback victory for Bayern Munich. And a few days later. Bayern Munich's opponent for the Champions League quarter-finals was decided. 「Bayern Munich vs Manchester United! They meet in the Champions League quarter-finals!」"},{"instruction":"170 * * * 챔피언스리그 8강. 이곳에선 세계 최고의 팀들끼리 경쟁해서 올라온 8개의 팀이 토너먼트 방식으로 만나게 된다. 최고 중 최고의 팀들만 오르는 곳이기에, 당연하게도 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심이 쏟아졌다. └ 이번 챔피언스리그는 어디가 우승할지 모르겠어. 전부 강한 팀만 모였잖아. └ 확실한 건 파리 생제르맹은 무게감이 떨어져. └ 바르셀로나, 레알 마드리드, 바이에른 뮌헨 중 한 팀이 우승하지 않을까? └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 기세가 장난 아니더라. 아스널 FC를 4 대 0으로 가볍게 때려잡던데? └ 아스널은 무게감이 떨어지는 팀이잖아? 걔네 잡았다고 기세가 좋다고 할 수 있나? └ 바이에른 뮌헨이랑 붙었을 때 당시의 아스널은 프리미어리그 2위였어. 한창 잘할 때였지. └ 아 그래? 프리미어리그 2위 팀이면 인정이지. 근데 지금은 순위가 조금 떨어졌던데? └ 우연인지는 모르겠지만, 아스널은 챔피언스리그 16강에서 바이에른 뮌헨한테 진 이후로 프리미어리그에서도 성적이 떨어졌지. └ 레알 마드리드, 바르셀로나, 바이에른 뮌헨의 삼파전이겠구만. └ 이봐! 첼시도 있다는 거 잊지 마! └ 하하! 첼시는 파리 생제르맹을 이길 수나 있나? 파리부터 이겨. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드에 관한 이야기는 전혀 없네? └ AT 마드리드는 어차피 FC 바르셀로나한테 질 거니까. 이 중 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심을 가장 많이 받는 팀은 레알 마드리드와 바르셀로나였다. 세계에서 가장 인기 있는 팀이자, 최근 기세가 아주 대단한 팀들이었기 때문이었다. 다음으로는 바이에른 뮌헨이었다. 축구팬들은 지난 시즌 분데스리가 우승팀이자, 이번 시즌도 무패 연승을 달리며 리그 1위인 이 팀을 유력한 우승 후보로 뽑았다. 그런 상황에서. ― 별들의 전쟁! 챔피언스리그 8강 1차전이 이제 곧 펼쳐집니다! 양 팀 선수들이 입장하고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들과 맨체스터 유나이티드 선수들이 경기장에 걸어들어왔다. ― 선수들이 굳은 표정으로 걸어들어오고 있네요! 분위기가 굉장히 뜨겁습니다! 하하! 경기장을 지켜보는 저희가 더 긴장되는데요? 관중석에 있는 팬분들도 숨죽인 채 선수들을 바라보고 있습니다! 그때였다. 관중들이 커다란 함성을 터트렸다. 경기가 시작됐기 때문이었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 천천히 패스를 주고받고 있습니다. 신중하네요! 상대인 맨체스터 유나이티드의 역습을 경계하는 모습이죠? ― 경계할 수밖에 없죠. 최근 맨체스터 유나이티드가 프리미어리그에서 좋지 못한 성적을 내고 있긴 하지만, 여전히 역습의 스피드는 대단한 팀이거든요? 특히 양쪽 윙어인 애슐리 영 선수와 발렌시아 선수의 속도는 정말 빠릅니다! ― 중요할 때마다 골을 넣어주는 로빈 판페르시 선수도 있죠! 신중하게 라인을 내린 채 지역방어를 하는 맨체스터 유나이티드와 역시나 신중하게 패스를 주고받으며 기회를 노리는 바이에른 뮌헨. 양 팀 선수들은 쉽게 무언가를 하지 않았다. 미리 짜기라도 한 듯, 서로가 탐색전을 펼쳤다. 경기의 흐름은 이상할 정도로 균형이 잡혀있었다. 그때였다. ― 오오? 신재욱 선수가 전진합니다! 신재욱이 균형을 깼다. 툭! 툭! 밑으로 내려와서 공을 받은 그는 드리블을 하며 앞으로 나아갔다. 그러자 맨체스터 유나이티드의 펠라이니와 웨인 루니가 달라붙었다. 2명의 압박이었다. 두 선수 모두 피지컬이 좋은 선수답게 신재욱이 전진하는 것을 막아냈다. ‘어우, 역시 루니랑 펠라이니의 몸싸움은 되게 세네.’ 신재욱이 혀를 내두르며 몸을 뒤로 뺐다. 그러면서도 공을 세밀하게 컨트롤했다. 웨인 루니와 펠라이니가 계속해서 덤벼들었지만, 공을 뺏기지 않았다. ‘쉽게 가야겠어.’ 지금과 같은 상황에서 마음만 먹으면 충분히 압박을 벗어날 자신이 있었지만. 신재욱은 그렇게 하지 않았다. 더 쉬운 방법을 택했다. 툭! 그는 가까이에 와준 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거에게 공을 넘기며 대각선 앞으로 움직였다. 그러자 슈바인슈타이거가 곧바로 패스를 보내줬다. 패스는 매우 정확했다. ‘그래, 패스는 이렇게 받기 쉽게 줘야지.’ 신재욱이 씨익 웃으며 굴러오는 공을 잡아냈다. 그의 시야엔 보였다. 언제든지 도와줄 준비가 된 동료들이. 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거, 토니 크로스, 아르연 로번, 프랑크 리베리, 필립 람이 주변을 맴돌며 지원을 해주는 모습은 보는 것만으로도 든든하게 느껴졌다. 이처럼 든든한 동료들이 있기에, 신재욱은 더욱 과감한 플레이를 펼쳤다. 그가 지금 하려는 건 중거리 슈팅이었다. 다만, 아직은 거리가 멀었다. 물론 시도할 수는 있는 거리였지만, 골이 될 확률을 높이고 싶었다. ‘조금만 더 앞으로 가면 돼.’ 그래서 움직였다. 더 좋은 슈팅 장소를 향해서. 하지만 방해가 들어왔다. 맨체스터 유나이티드의 중앙수비수 네마냐 비디치가 앞으로 튀어나오며 신재욱의 앞을 가로막았다. ‘네마냐 비디치……이 친구랑은 오랜만에 붙어보네.’ 신재욱의 미소가 짙어졌다. 현시점에선 전성기가 지나긴 했지만, 그래도 여전히 최고의 수비수 중 하나인 네마냐 비디치를 상대하게 됐다는 것. 그 사실이 즐겁게 느껴졌다. ― 네마냐 비디치가 신재욱을 막아섰습니다! 신재욱 선수, 네마냐 비디치를 상대로도 돌파를 시도할까요? 네마냐 비디치는 어지간해선 뚫리지 않아서 국내 팬분들 사이에서 벽디치라고 불릴 정도거든요? 해설들의 말처럼 수비 능력이 굉장한 선수인 네마냐 비디치는 자세를 낮춘 채, 날카로운 눈빛으로 신재욱의 움직임을 주시했다. 이렇게 앞을 막고 있는 것만으로도 대단한 위압감을 뿜어냈다. 세계 최고의 수비수 중 하나다운 기세였다. ‘살벌하다, 살벌해. 이러니 웬만한 선수는 비디치 앞에서 쫄 수밖에 없지.’ 다만 신재욱은 전혀 위축되지 않았다. 그럴 필요가 없었다. 그는 이미 네마냐 비디치와의 대결에서 이겨본 경험이 있었으니까. 그것도 제법 많이. ‘꽤 오래되긴 했지만, 그래도 이겨봤던 선수를 다시 이기는 건 어렵지 않지.’ 네마냐 비디치를 앞에 둔 채. 신재욱은 페인팅을 시도했다. 가장 먼저 시선을 이용한 속임수와 동시에 스텝오버를 짧고 빠르게 펼친 뒤, 오른쪽으로 공을 툭 쳤다. 그러자 비디치가 반응했다. 그는 재빨리 움직여 신재욱이 들어가려는 곳의 공간을 막아섰다. 그런데 그 순간 네마냐 비디치의 얼굴이 일그러졌다. “이런……!” 신재욱에게 속았다는 것을 깨달았기 때문이었다. * * * 네마냐 비디치를 앞에 둔 신재욱은 페인팅을 펼치는 것과 동시에 드리블 돌파를 시도했다. 뚫을 수 있다는 확신이 있기에 한 시도였다. ‘이건 환생 전에도 네마냐 비디치에게 잘 통하던 거니까.’ 신재욱은 헛다리를 짚은 뒤, 오른쪽으로 파고들 것처럼 움직였다. 그러나 이건 속임수였다. 오른쪽으로 움직일 것처럼 한 뒤, 왼쪽으로 파고들었다. 만약 단순히 방향을 바꾼 것이라면 네마냐 비디치가 속지 않았을 것이다. 그러나 신재욱은 플립 플랩을 사용했다. 오른발의 바깥쪽으로 공을 오른쪽으로 민 뒤, 재빨리 오른발의 안쪽을 이용해 공을 왼쪽으로 끌어오는 고급 기술. 순식간에 펼쳐진 몇 개의 속임수에 세계 최고의 수비수 중 하나인 네마냐 비디치조차 완벽하게 당해버렸다. ― 우워어어어어! 뚫렸습니다! 신재욱 선수가 화려한 드리블로 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비를 뚫어냈습니다! 네마냐 비디치가 아무것도 못 하고 뚫려버리네요! ― 우와아아! 신재욱 선수! 정말 대단합니다! 해설들이 경악했다. 눈을 동그랗게 뜬 채, 네마냐 비디치를 너무나도 쉽게 뚫어낸 신재욱의 움직임에 집중했다. 반면 네마냐 비디치를 뚫어낸 신재욱은 쓴웃음을 지었다. ‘확실히 반응속도가 느려. 전성기 때의 네마냐 비디치였다면 이렇게까지 쉽게 당하진 않았을 거야.’ 노쇠화되며 전성기가 지난 레전드의 모습이 안타까웠기 때문이었다. 그러나 그런 생각은 금세 사라졌다. 신재욱은 달려오는 다비드 데헤아 골키퍼의 움직임에 집중했다. 골키퍼가 달려오는 속도, 타이밍을 보며 다시 한번 드리블을 했다. 이번엔 더욱 속도를 높이며 방향을 틀었다. 다비드 데헤아는 민첩성이 대단한 선수였지만, 바로 앞에서 갑자기 방향을 틀어버리는 신재욱의 움직임을 따라가진 못했다. ― 오오오오! 제쳤습니다! 신재욱 선수가 다비드 데헤아 골키퍼까지 뚫어냈습니다! 분데스리가의 득점왕이 아스널에 이어서 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비마저 완전히 무너뜨렸습니다! 다비드 데헤아까지 제쳐낸 상황에서 신재욱의 앞엔 빈 골대밖에 없었다. 근처에서 리오 퍼디낸드가 달려오고 있지만, 골대로 공을 밀어 넣을 시간은 충분했다. 투욱! 신재욱은 맨체스터 유나이티드의 빈 골대 안으로 공을 밀어 넣었다. 철렁! 골망이 흔들렸고. 그 순간 관중석에 있던 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들이 함성을 질렀다. 우워어어어어어어! ― 고오오오오오올! 골입니다! 신재욱 선수의 선제골로 바이에른 뮌헨이 1 대 0으로 앞서갑니다! ― 신재욱 선수! 자신이 왜 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커인지를 챔피언스리그 8강전에서도 증명하고 있습니다! 네마냐 비디치 선수를 상대로도 전혀 위축되지 않고 과감하게 돌파를 시도하는 모습이 굉장히 인상적이네요! 해설들도 관중들과 같이 흥분했고. 실시간으로 바이에른 뮌헨과 맨체스터 유나이티드의 경기를 지켜보던 전 세계 축구팬들 역시 신재욱의 골에 흥분했다. └ 뭐야!!!!! 신재욱 얘 발밑 기술이 왜 이렇게 좋아? 스텝오버랑 플립 플랩을 이렇게나 잘 쓰는 선수였어? └ 미친 골이 나왔군!!!! 다들 봤지? 신재욱은 공격수로서 필요한 모든 능력을 지닌 선수야! 분데스리가 경기를 보면 이 말이 무슨 뜻인지 알게 될 거야! └ 신재욱은 한국의 왕이야! └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 슈퍼스타이기도 하지. └ 분데스리가의 득점왕이 이 정도였구나? 네마냐 비디치랑 다비드 데헤아를 아마추어처럼 보이게 만들었어……! └ 아무리 네마냐 비디치가 과거와 같은 몸 상태가 아니라고 해도 절대 쉽게 뚫리는 선수가 아닌데…… 이 장면은 많이 충격적이야……! └ 아스널과의 경기에서 해트트릭했던 게 우연이 아니었어! 신재욱 얘는 진짜라고! └ 원더골!!!! 바이에른 뮌헨의 신재욱이 환상적인 골을 넣었어! 반면에 네마냐 비디치가 불쌍하게 보였어. └ 난 늘 말하고 다녔어. 신재욱은 세계 최고 수준의 스트라이커야! 그리고 얜 머지않아 그 누구도 따라올 수 없는 세계 최고의 스트라이커가 될 거야! └ 젠장! 한국이 부러워지고 있어. 이렇게 대단한 선수를 가졌다니! 모두를 흥분시키며 경기장의 분위기를 바꿔놓은 신재욱. 그는 자신보다 더 흥분한 동료들의 축하를 받으며, 허공을 바라봤다. 그곳엔 메시지들이 생성되고 있었다. ‘챔피언스리그 8강이라서 메시지의 숫자도 다르네.’ 여러 개의 메시지가 허공을 수놓았다. 물론 그중 신재욱의 눈을 사로잡은 건 2개의 메시지뿐이었다. [특성이 성장합니다!] [‘최고의 집중력(A)’이 ‘극도의 집중력(S)’으로 성장합니다!] [특성이 성장합니다!] [‘단단한 신체(C)’가 ‘경이로운 신체(B)’로 성장합니다!]","output":"170 --- Champions League Quarterfinals. Here, the top 8 teams that have competed and risen to the top meet in a tournament format. Since only the best of the best teams make it here, naturally, the attention of football fans worldwide was poured into this event. └ I can't tell who will win the Champions League this time. All the strong teams are gathered. └ One thing's for sure, Paris Saint-Germain seems to have lost its edge. └ Wouldn't one of Barcelona, Real Madrid, or Bayern Munich win? └ Bayern Munich's momentum is no joke. Didn't they easily beat Arsenal FC 4 to 0? └ Isn't Arsenal a team that's lost its edge? Can you say they have good momentum just because they beat them? └ When Bayern Munich faced them, Arsenal was second in the Premier League. They were doing well at the time. └ Really? If they were second in the Premier League, that's respectable. But their ranking has dropped a bit now, hasn't it? └ I don't know if it's a coincidence, but Arsenal's performance in the Premier League also dropped after they lost to Bayern Munich in the Champions League Round of 16. └ It's going to be a three-way battle between Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich. └ Hey! Don't forget Chelsea is there too! └ Haha! Can Chelsea even beat Paris Saint-Germain? Beat Paris first. └ No talk about Atlético Madrid? └ Atlético Madrid is going to lose to FC Barcelona anyway. Among these, the teams that received the most attention from football fans worldwide were Real Madrid and Barcelona. They were the most popular teams in the world and had been in great form recently. Next was Bayern Munich. Football fans picked this team, last season's Bundesliga champions and currently undefeated and leading the league, as a strong contender for the title. In this situation. ― The war of the stars! The first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals is about to unfold! The players from both teams are entering the field! The players from Bayern Munich and Manchester United walked into the stadium. ― The players are walking in with stern expressions! The atmosphere is incredibly hot! Haha! Even we are more nervous watching the stadium! The fans in the stands are also watching the players with bated breath! That's when it happened. The crowd erupted in a huge cheer. Because the game had started. ― Bayern Munich is slowly passing the ball around. They're being cautious! Are they wary of Manchester United's counterattacks? ― They have to be cautious. Although Manchester United hasn't been doing well in the Premier League recently, they still have incredible speed in their counterattacks, right? Especially the speed of the wingers, Ashley Young and Valencia, is really fast! ― And there's Robin van Persie, who always scores when it matters! Manchester United, playing a zonal defense with a lowered line, and Bayern Munich, also cautiously passing the ball around, looking for an opportunity. Neither team made any hasty moves. As if they had agreed beforehand, they both engaged in a probing battle. The flow of the game was strangely balanced. That's when it happened. ― Oh? Shin Jaewook is moving forward! Shin Jaewook broke the balance. Tap! Tap! Coming down to receive the ball, he dribbled forward. Then, Manchester United's Fellaini and Wayne Rooney clung to him. It was pressure from two players. Both players, true to their physical prowess, stopped Shin Jaewook's advance. 'Ouch, the physical battles with Rooney and Fellaini are really tough.' Shin Jaewook clicked his tongue and pulled back his body. Even so, he controlled the ball delicately. Wayne Rooney and Fellaini kept lunging at him, but he didn't lose the ball. 'I should take it easy.' He was confident that he could escape the pressure if he wanted to in the current situation. But Shin Jaewook didn't do that. He chose an easier way. Tap! He passed the ball to Bastian Schweinsteiger, who had come close, and moved diagonally forward. Then Schweinsteiger immediately sent the ball back with a pass. The pass was very accurate. 'Yeah, that's how you should give a pass, easy to receive.' Shin Jaewook smiled and caught the rolling ball. He saw them in his field of vision. His teammates, ready to help at any moment. Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribéry, Philipp Lahm – the sight of them circling around and providing support felt reassuring just by looking at it. With such reliable teammates, Shin Jaewook played even more boldly. What he was about to do now was a long-range shot. However, the distance was still far. Of course, it was a distance where he could attempt a shot, but he wanted to increase the probability of scoring a goal. 'I just need to move a bit further forward.' So he moved. Towards a better shooting spot. But there was an interference. Manchester United's central defender Nemanja Vidić stepped forward and blocked Shin Jaewook's path. 'Nemanja Vidić... it's been a while since I've faced him.' Shin Jaewook's smile deepened. Although he was past his prime at this point, the fact that he was facing one of the world's top defenders, Nemanja Vidić, felt enjoyable. ― Nemanja Vidić has confronted Shin Jaewook! Will Shin Jaewook attempt to break through even against Nemanja Vidić? Nemanja Vidić is known as a wall among domestic fans because he's not easily penetrated! As the commentators said, Nemanja Vidić, a player with tremendous defensive ability, lowered his stance and watched Shin Jaewook's movements with sharp eyes. Just by blocking the way, he exuded an incredible sense of pressure. It was the presence befitting one of the world's top defenders. 'It's fierce, really fierce. That's why most players would be intimidated in front of Vidić.' However, Shin Jaewook was not intimidated at all. There was no need to be. He had already experienced victory against Nemanja Vidić in their encounters. Quite a few times, in fact. 'It's been a while, but it's not hard to beat a player I've already beaten before.' In front of Nemanja Vidić. Shin Jaewook attempted a feint. First, he used a gaze trick along with a quick stepover, then tapped the ball to the right. Vidić reacted. He quickly moved to block the space where Shin Jaewook was trying to enter. But at that moment, Nemanja Vidić's face contorted. \\"Damn...!\\" He realized he had been fooled by Shin Jaewook. --- In front of Nemanja Vidić, Shin Jaewook executed a feint while attempting a dribble breakthrough. It was an attempt made with the confidence that he could penetrate. 'This worked well against Nemanja Vidić even before my reincarnation.' Shin Jaewook feinted and then moved as if he was going to break through to the right. But it was a ruse. After making it seem like he was moving to the right, he broke through to the left. If it had been a simple change of direction, Nemanja Vidić would not have been fooled. But Shin Jaewook used the flip flap. A high-level technique where he pushed the ball to the right with the outside of his right foot, then quickly used the inside of the same foot to pull the ball to the left. In an instant, a few tricks unfolded, and even Nemanja Vidić, one of the world's top defenders, was completely outplayed. ― Wow! He's broken through! Shin Jaewook has penetrated Manchester United's defense with a dazzling dribble! Nemanja Vidić couldn't do anything and was penetrated! ― Wow! Shin Jaewook! He's really amazing! The commentators were astonished. With wide eyes, they focused on Shin Jaewook's movement, who had so easily broken through Nemanja Vidić. Meanwhile, Shin Jaewook, who had penetrated Vidić, gave a wry smile. 'His reaction speed has definitely slowed down. If it had been Nemanja Vidić in his prime, he wouldn't have been fooled so easily.' He felt a pang of regret seeing the decline of a legend past his prime. But such thoughts quickly vanished. Shin Jaewook focused on the movements of the approaching goalkeeper, David de Gea. He watched the goalkeeper's speed and timing and dribbled once more. This time, he increased his speed and changed direction. David de Gea was a player with great agility, but he couldn't keep up with Shin Jaewook's sudden change of direction right in front of him. ― Oh! He's bypassed him! Shin Jaewook has penetrated David de Gea, the goalkeeper! The Bundesliga's top scorer has completely shattered the defense of Manchester United after Arsenal! With David de Gea bypassed, there was nothing but an empty goal in front of Shin Jaewook. Rio Ferdinand was rushing nearby, but there was enough time to push the ball into the goal. Thump! Shin Jaewook pushed the ball into the empty net of Manchester United. Clang! The goal net shook. At that moment, the fans of Bayern Munich in the stands screamed. Wow! ― Goal! It's a goal! Shin Jaewook's opening goal puts Bayern Munich ahead 1 to 0! ― Shin Jaewook! He's proving why he's the best striker in the Bundesliga even in the Champions League quarterfinals! It's impressive how he boldly attempted to break through without being intimidated by Nemanja Vidić! The commentators were as excited as the fans. Football fans worldwide watching the Bayern Munich and Manchester United match live were also thrilled by Shin Jaewook's goal. └ What! Shin Jaewook's footwork is so good? Was he always this good with stepovers and flip flaps? └ Insane goal!!!! Did everyone see that? Shin Jaewook has all the abilities needed as a forward! If you watch the Bundesliga games, you'll understand what I mean! └ Shin Jaewook is the king of Korea! └ And also a superstar for Bayern Munich. └ Was the Bundesliga's top scorer this good? He made Nemanja Vidić and David de Gea look like amateurs... └ Even if Nemanja Vidić isn't in the same physical condition as before, he's definitely not a player who gets penetrated easily... This scene is quite shocking... └ The hat-trick against Arsenal wasn't a fluke! Shin Jaewook is the real deal! └ Wonder goal!!!! Bayern Munich's Shin Jaewook has scored a fantastic goal! On the other hand, Nemanja Vidić looked pitiful. └ I've always said it. Shin Jaewook is a world-class striker! And he will soon become the world's best striker that no one can match! └ Damn! I'm starting to envy Korea. To have such an amazing player! Shin Jaewook, who excited everyone and changed the atmosphere of the stadium. He received congratulations from his teammates, who were even more excited than himself, and looked up into the air. Messages were being generated there. 'The Champions League quarterfinals, so the number of messages is different.' Several messages adorned the air. Of course, only two messages caught Shin Jaewook's eye. [Your trait has grown!] ['Supreme Concentration (A)' has grown into 'Extreme Concentration (S)'.] [Your trait has grown!] ['Sturdy Body (C)' has grown into 'Marvelous Body (B)'.]"},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It seems you wanted to provide a text for translation, but you didn't include it in your message.

파리부터 이겨. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드에 관한 이야기는 전혀 없네? └ AT 마드리드는 어차피 FC 바르셀로나한테 질 거니까. 이 중 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심을 가장 많이 받는 팀은 레알 마드리드와 바르셀로나였다. 세계에서 가장 인기 있는 팀이자, 최근 기세가 아주 대단한 팀들이었기 때문이었다. 다음으로는 바이에른 뮌헨이었다. 축구팬들은 지난 시즌 분데스리가 우승팀이자, 이번 시즌도 무패 연승을 달리며 리그 1위인 이 팀을 유력한 우승 후보로 뽑았다. 그런 상황에서. ― 별들의 전쟁! 챔피언스리그 8강 1차전이 이제 곧 펼쳐집니다! 양 팀 선수들이 입장하고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들과 맨체스터 유나이티드 선수들이 경기장에 걸어들어왔다. ― 선수들이 굳은 표정으로 걸어들어오고 있네요! 분위기가 굉장히 뜨겁습니다! 하하! 경기장을 지켜보는 저희가 더 긴장되는데요? 관중석에 있는 팬분들도 숨죽인 채 선수들을 바라보고 있습니다! 그때였다. 관중들이 커다란 함성을 터트렸다. 경기가 시작됐기 때문이었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 천천히 패스를 주고받고 있습니다. 신중하네요! 상대인 맨체스터 유나이티드의 역습을 경계하는 모습이죠? ― 경계할 수밖에 없죠. 최근 맨체스터 유나이티드가 프리미어리그에서 좋지 못한 성적을 내고 있긴 하지만, 여전히 역습의 스피드는 대단한 팀이거든요? 특히 양쪽 윙어인 애슐리 영 선수와 발렌시아 선수의 속도는 정말 빠릅니다! ― 중요할 때마다 골을 넣어주는 로빈 판페르시 선수도 있죠! 신중하게 라인을 내린 채 지역방어를 하는 맨체스터 유나이티드와 역시나 신중하게 패스를 주고받으며 기회를 노리는 바이에른 뮌헨. 양 팀 선수들은 쉽게 무언가를 하지 않았다. 미리 짜기라도 한 듯, 서로가 탐색전을 펼쳤다. 경기의 흐름은 이상할 정도로 균형이 잡혀있었다. 그때였다. ― 오오? 신재욱 선수가 전진합니다! 신재욱이 균형을 깼다. 툭! 툭! 밑으로 내려와서 공을 받은 그는 드리블을 하며 앞으로 나아갔다. 그러자 맨체스터 유나이티드의 펠라이니와 웨인 루니가 달라붙었다. 2명의 압박이었다. 두 선수 모두 피지컬이 좋은 선수답게 신재욱이 전진하는 것을 막아냈다. ‘어우, 역시 루니랑 펠라이니의 몸싸움은 되게 세네.’ 신재욱이 혀를 내두르며 몸을 뒤로 뺐다. 그러면서도 공을 세밀하게 컨트롤했다. 웨인 루니와 펠라이니가 계속해서 덤벼들었지만, 공을 뺏기지 않았다. ‘쉽게 가야겠어.’ 지금과 같은 상황에서 마음만 먹으면 충분히 압박을 벗어날 자신이 있었지만. 신재욱은 그렇게 하지 않았다. 더 쉬운 방법을 택했다. 툭! 그는 가까이에 와준 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거에게 공을 넘기며 대각선 앞으로 움직였다. 그러자 슈바인슈타이거가 곧바로 패스를 보내줬다. 패스는 매우 정확했다. ‘그래, 패스는 이렇게 받기 쉽게 줘야지.’ 신재욱이 씨익 웃으며 굴러오는 공을 잡아냈다. 그의 시야엔 보였다. 언제든지 도와줄 준비가 된 동료들이. 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거, 토니 크로스, 아르연 로번, 프랑크 리베리, 필립 람이 주변을 맴돌며 지원을 해주는 모습은 보는 것만으로도 든든하게 느껴졌다. 이처럼 든든한 동료들이 있기에, 신재욱은 더욱 과감한 플레이를 펼쳤다. 그가 지금 하려는 건 중거리 슈팅이었다. 다만, 아직은 거리가 멀었다. 물론 시도할 수는 있는 거리였지만, 골이 될 확률을 높이고 싶었다. ‘조금만 더 앞으로 가면 돼.’ 그래서 움직였다. 더 좋은 슈팅 장소를 향해서. 하지만 방해가 들어왔다. 맨체스터 유나이티드의 중앙수비수 네마냐 비디치가 앞으로 튀어나오며 신재욱의 앞을 가로막았다. ‘네마냐 비디치……이 친구랑은 오랜만에 붙어보네.’ 신재욱의 미소가 짙어졌다. 현시점에선 전성기가 지나긴 했지만, 그래도 여전히 최고의 수비수 중 하나인 네마냐 비디치를 상대하게 됐다는 것. 그 사실이 즐겁게 느껴졌다. ― 네마냐 비디치가 신재욱을 막아섰습니다! 신재욱 선수, 네마냐 비디치를 상대로도 돌파를 시도할까요? 네마냐 비디치는 어지간해선 뚫리지 않아서 국내 팬분들 사이에서 벽디치라고 불릴 정도거든요? 해설들의 말처럼 수비 능력이 굉장한 선수인 네마냐 비디치는 자세를 낮춘 채, 날카로운 눈빛으로 신재욱의 움직임을 주시했다. 이렇게 앞을 막고 있는 것만으로도 대단한 위압감을 뿜어냈다. 세계 최고의 수비수 중 하나다운 기세였다. ‘살벌하다, 살벌해. 이러니 웬만한 선수는 비디치 앞에서 쫄 수밖에 없지.’ 다만 신재욱은 전혀 위축되지 않았다. 그럴 필요가 없었다. 그는 이미 네마냐 비디치와의 대결에서 이겨본 경험이 있었으니까. 그것도 제법 많이. ‘꽤 오래되긴 했지만, 그래도 이겨봤던 선수를 다시 이기는 건 어렵지 않지.’ 네마냐 비디치를 앞에 둔 채. 신재욱은 페인팅을 시도했다. 가장 먼저 시선을 이용한 속임수와 동시에 스텝오버를 짧고 빠르게 펼친 뒤, 오른쪽으로 공을 툭 쳤다. 그러자 비디치가 반응했다. 그는 재빨리 움직여 신재욱이 들어가려는 곳의 공간을 막아섰다. 그런데 그 순간 네마냐 비디치의 얼굴이 일그러졌다. “이런……!” 신재욱에게 속았다는 것을 깨달았기 때문이었다. * * * 네마냐 비디치를 앞에 둔 신재욱은 페인팅을 펼치는 것과 동시에 드리블 돌파를 시도했다. 뚫을 수 있다는 확신이 있기에 한 시도였다. ‘이건 환생 전에도 네마냐 비디치에게 잘 통하던 거니까.’ 신재욱은 헛다리를 짚은 뒤, 오른쪽으로 파고들 것처럼 움직였다. 그러나 이건 속임수였다. 오른쪽으로 움직일 것처럼 한 뒤, 왼쪽으로 파고들었다. 만약 단순히 방향을 바꾼 것이라면 네마냐 비디치가 속지 않았을 것이다. 그러나 신재욱은 플립 플랩을 사용했다. 오른발의 바깥쪽으로 공을 오른쪽으로 민 뒤, 재빨리 오른발의 안쪽을 이용해 공을 왼쪽으로 끌어오는 고급 기술. 순식간에 펼쳐진 몇 개의 속임수에 세계 최고의 수비수 중 하나인 네마냐 비디치조차 완벽하게 당해버렸다. ― 우워어어어어! 뚫렸습니다! 신재욱 선수가 화려한 드리블로 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비를 뚫어냈습니다! 네마냐 비디치가 아무것도 못 하고 뚫려버리네요! ― 우와아아! 신재욱 선수! 정말 대단합니다! 해설들이 경악했다. 눈을 동그랗게 뜬 채, 네마냐 비디치를 너무나도 쉽게 뚫어낸 신재욱의 움직임에 집중했다. 반면 네마냐 비디치를 뚫어낸 신재욱은 쓴웃음을 지었다. ‘확실히 반응속도가 느려. 전성기 때의 네마냐 비디치였다면 이렇게까지 쉽게 당하진 않았을 거야.’ 노쇠화되며 전성기가 지난 레전드의 모습이 안타까웠기 때문이었다. 그러나 그런 생각은 금세 사라졌다. 신재욱은 달려오는 다비드 데헤아 골키퍼의 움직임에 집중했다. 골키퍼가 달려오는 속도, 타이밍을 보며 다시 한번 드리블을 했다. 이번엔 더욱 속도를 높이며 방향을 틀었다. 다비드 데헤아는 민첩성이 대단한 선수였지만, 바로 앞에서 갑자기 방향을 틀어버리는 신재욱의 움직임을 따라가진 못했다. ― 오오오오! 제쳤습니다! 신재욱 선수가 다비드 데헤아 골키퍼까지 뚫어냈습니다! 분데스리가의 득점왕이 아스널에 이어서 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비마저 완전히 무너뜨렸습니다! 다비드 데헤아까지 제쳐낸 상황에서 신재욱의 앞엔 빈 골대밖에 없었다. 근처에서 리오 퍼디낸드가 달려오고 있지만, 골대로 공을 밀어 넣을 시간은 충분했다. 투욱! 신재욱은 맨체스터 유나이티드의 빈 골대 안으로 공을 밀어 넣었다. 철렁! 골망이 흔들렸고. 그 순간 관중석에 있던 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들이 함성을 질렀다. 우워어어어어어어! ― 고오오오오오올! 골입니다! 신재욱 선수의 선제골로 바이에른 뮌헨이 1 대 0으로 앞서갑니다! ― 신재욱 선수! 자신이 왜 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커인지를 챔피언스리그 8강전에서도 증명하고 있습니다! 네마냐 비디치 선수를 상대로도 전혀 위축되지 않고 과감하게 돌파를 시도하는 모습이 굉장히 인상적이네요! 해설들도 관중들과 같이 흥분했고. 실시간으로 바이에른 뮌헨과 맨체스터 유나이티드의 경기를 지켜보던 전 세계 축구팬들 역시 신재욱의 골에 흥분했다. └ 뭐야!!!!! 신재욱 얘 발밑 기술이 왜 이렇게 좋아? 스텝오버랑 플립 플랩을 이렇게나 잘 쓰는 선수였어? └ 미친 골이 나왔군!!!! 다들 봤지? 신재욱은 공격수로서 필요한 모든 능력을 지닌 선수야! 분데스리가 경기를 보면 이 말이 무슨 뜻인지 알게 될 거야! └ 신재욱은 한국의 왕이야! └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 슈퍼스타이기도 하지. └ 분데스리가의 득점왕이 이 정도였구나? 네마냐 비디치랑 다비드 데헤아를 아마추어처럼 보이게 만들었어……! └ 아무리 네마냐 비디치가 과거와 같은 몸 상태가 아니라고 해도 절대 쉽게 뚫리는 선수가 아닌데…… 이 장면은 많이 충격적이야……! └ 아스널과의 경기에서 해트트릭했던 게 우연이 아니었어! 신재욱 얘는 진짜라고! └ 원더골!!!! 바이에른 뮌헨의 신재욱이 환상적인 골을 넣었어! 반면에 네마냐 비디치가 불쌍하게 보였어. └ 난 늘 말하고 다녔어. 신재욱은 세계 최고 수준의 스트라이커야! 그리고 얜 머지않아 그 누구도 따라올 수 없는 세계 최고의 스트라이커가 될 거야! └ 젠장! 한국이 부러워지고 있어. 이렇게 대단한 선수를 가졌다니! 모두를 흥분시키며 경기장의 분위기를 바꿔놓은 신재욱. 그는 자신보다 더 흥분한 동료들의 축하를 받으며, 허공을 바라봤다. 그곳엔 메시지들이 생성되고 있었다. ‘챔피언스리그 8강이라서 메시지의 숫자도 다르네.’ 여러 개의 메시지가 허공을 수놓았다. 물론 그중 신재욱의 눈을 사로잡은 건 2개의 메시지뿐이었다. [특성이 성장합니다!] [‘최고의 집중력(A)’이 ‘극도의 집중력(S)’으로 성장합니다!] [특성이 성장합니다!] [‘단단한 신체(C)’가 ‘경이로운 신체(B)’로 성장합니다!]","output":"170 --- Champions League Quarterfinals. Here, the top eight teams that have competed and risen from among the world's best meet in a tournament format. As only the best of the best teams make it here, naturally, the attention of football fans worldwide was poured into it. └ I can't tell who will win this Champions League. It's all strong teams gathered. └ One thing's for sure, Paris Saint-Germain has lost its gravitas. └ Wouldn't one of Barcelona, Real Madrid, or Bayern Munich win? └ Bayern Munich's momentum is no joke. Didn't they easily beat Arsenal FC 4 to 0? └ Arsenal is a team that's lost its gravitas, right? Can we say they have good momentum just because they beat them? └ When Bayern Munich faced them, Arsenal was second in the Premier League. They were doing well at the time. └ Really? If it's the Premier League's second-place team, that's respectable. But their ranking has dropped a bit now, hasn't it? └ I don't know if it's a coincidence, but Arsenal's performance in the Premier League also dropped after they lost to Bayern Munich in the Champions League Round of 16. └ It's going to be a three-way battle between Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich. └ Hey! Don't forget Chelsea is there too! └ Ha! Can Chelsea even beat Paris Saint-Germain? Beat Paris first. └ No talk about Atlético Madrid? └ AT Madrid is going to lose to FC Barcelona anyway. Among these, the teams that received the most attention from football fans worldwide were Real Madrid and Barcelona. They were the most popular teams in the world and had been in great form recently. Next was Bayern Munich. Football fans picked this team, last season's Bundesliga champions and currently undefeated and leading the league this season, as a strong candidate for the championship. In such a situation... ― The war of the stars! The first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals is about to unfold! The players from both teams are entering! Bayern Munich players and Manchester United players walked into the stadium. ― The players are walking in with stern expressions! The atmosphere is incredibly hot! Ha! We're more nervous just watching the stadium! Fans in the stands are also holding their breath and watching the players! That's when it happened. The crowd erupted in a huge cheer. Because the game had started. ― Bayern Munich is slowly passing the ball around. They're being cautious! They seem to be wary of Manchester United's counterattacks, right? ― They have to be cautious. Although Manchester United has not been doing well in the Premier League recently, they still have an incredible speed in counterattacks, especially with wingers like Ashley Young and Valencia! ― And there's Robin van Persie, who always scores important goals! Manchester United, cautiously pulling back their line for zone defense, and Bayern Munich, also cautiously passing the ball around looking for an opportunity. Neither team made a move easily. As if they had planned it in advance, they both engaged in a probing battle. The flow of the game was strangely balanced. That's when it happened. ― Oh? Shin Jae-wook is moving forward! Shin Jae-wook broke the balance. Thump! Thump! Coming down to receive the ball, he dribbled forward. Then, Manchester United's Fellaini and Wayne Rooney stuck to him. It was pressure from two players. Both players, known for their physicality, managed to stop Shin Jae-wook's advance. ‘Wow, the physical fight with Rooney and Fellaini is really tough.’ Shin Jae-wook clicked his tongue and pulled back his body. Even so, he controlled the ball delicately. Wayne Rooney and Fellaini kept lunging at him, but he didn't lose the ball. ‘I should take it easy.’ He was confident that he could shake off the pressure if he wanted to in the current situation. However, Shin Jae-wook didn't do that. He chose an easier way. Thump! He passed the ball to Bastian Schweinsteiger, who had come close, and moved diagonally forward. Then Schweinsteiger immediately sent a pass back. The pass was very accurate. ‘That's right, passes should be easy to receive like this.’ Shin Jae-wook grinned and caught the rolling ball. In his view, he saw them. Teammates ready to help at any time. Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribéry, Philipp Lahm were circling around, providing support, and it felt reassuring just to see them. With such reliable teammates, Shin Jae-wook played even more boldly. What he was trying to do now was a long-range shot. However, the distance was still far. Of course, it was a distance where he could attempt a shot, but he wanted to increase the probability of scoring a goal. ‘I just need to move a little further forward.’ So he moved. Towards a better shooting spot. But there was an interruption. Manchester United's central defender Nemanja Vidić stepped forward and blocked Shin Jae-wook's path. ‘Nemanja Vidić... it's been a while since I've faced this guy.’ Shin Jae-wook's smile deepened. Although he was past his prime at this point, the fact that he was facing Nemanja Vidić, still one of the best defenders, was enjoyable. ― Nemanja Vidić has confronted Shin Jae-wook! Will Shin Jae-wook attempt to break through even against Nemanja Vidić? Nemanja Vidić is known to be so solid in defense that he's called \\"Wall-dić\\" among domestic fans. As the commentators said, Nemanja Vidić, a player with tremendous defensive ability, watched Shin Jae-wook's movements with sharp eyes, crouching low. Just by blocking the way, he exuded an incredible sense of intimidation. It was the aura of one of the world's best defenders. ‘It's fierce, really fierce. This is why most players freeze in front of Vidić.’ However, Shin Jae-wook was not intimidated at all. There was no need to be. He had already experienced defeating Nemanja Vidić before. And not just once, but quite a few times. ‘It's been a while, but it's not hard to beat a player I've beaten before.’ In front of Nemanja Vidić. Shin Jae-wook attempted a feint. First, he used his gaze as a deception and simultaneously performed a quick stepover, then nudged the ball to the right. Vidić reacted. He quickly moved to block the space where Shin Jae-wook was trying to enter. But at that moment, Nemanja Vidić's face contorted. “Damn...!” He realized he had been fooled by Shin Jae-wook. --- In front of Nemanja Vidić, Shin Jae-wook feinted while attempting a dribble breakthrough. It was an attempt made with the confidence that he could break through. ‘This worked well against Nemanja Vidić even before my reincarnation.’ Shin Jae-wook feigned a move and then acted as if he was going to break through to the right. But it was a ruse. After pretending to move to the right, he broke through to the left. If it had been a simple change of direction, Nemanja Vidić would not have been fooled. However, Shin Jae-wook used the flip flap. Using the outside of his right foot to push the ball to the right, then quickly using the inside of the same foot to pull the ball to the left—a sophisticated technique. In an instant, several deceptions unfolded, and even Nemanja Vidić, one of the world's best defenders, was completely fooled. ― Wowww! He's broken through! Shin Jae-wook has pierced through Manchester United's defense with a dazzling dribble! Nemanja Vidić couldn't do anything and was breached! ― Wow! Shin Jae-wook! Truly amazing! The commentators were astonished. With eyes wide open, they focused on Shin Jae-wook's movement, who had so easily breached Nemanja Vidić. On the other hand, Shin Jae-wook, who had breached Vidić, gave a wry smile. ‘His reaction speed has definitely slowed down. If it had been Nemanja Vidić in his prime, he wouldn't have been fooled so easily.’ He felt sorry for the sight of a legend who had aged and was past his prime. But such thoughts quickly vanished. Shin Jae-wook focused on the movements of the approaching goalkeeper, David de Gea. Watching the goalkeeper's speed and timing, he dribbled again. This time, he increased his speed and changed direction more abruptly. David de Gea was a player with great agility, but he couldn't keep up with Shin Jae-wook's sudden change of direction right in front of him. ― Ohhh! He's bypassed him! Shin Jae-wook has also breached goalkeeper David de Gea! The Bundesliga's top scorer has completely shattered Arsenal's and now Manchester United's defense! With David de Gea also bypassed, there was nothing but an empty goal in front of Shin Jae-wook. Rio Ferdinand was rushing nearby, but there was enough time to push the ball into the goal. Thwack! Shin Jae-wook pushed the ball into Manchester United's empty goal. Clang! The goal net shook. At that moment, the Bayern Munich fans in the stands screamed. Wowwwww! ― Goooaal! Goal! Shin Jae-wook's opening goal puts Bayern Munich ahead 1 to 0! ― Shin Jae-wook! He's proving why he's the best striker in the Bundesliga even in the Champions League quarterfinals! His bold attempt to break through against Nemanja Vidić without any intimidation is very impressive! The commentators, like the fans, were excited. And football fans worldwide watching the live match between Bayern Munich and Manchester United were also thrilled by Shin Jae-wook's goal. └ What the! Shin Jae-wook's footwork is so good? He uses stepovers and flip flaps so well? └ Crazy goal! Did everyone see? Shin Jae-wook has all the abilities needed as a forward! If you watch the Bundesliga games, you'll understand what I mean! └ Shin Jae-wook is the king of Korea! └ And a superstar for Bayern Munich. └ The Bundesliga's top scorer was this good? He made Nemanja Vidić and David de Gea look like amateurs...! └ Even if Nemanja Vidić isn't in the same physical condition as before, he's definitely not a player who gets breached easily... This scene is quite shocking...! └ It wasn't a fluke that he scored a hat-trick against Arsenal! Shin Jae-wook is the real deal! └ Wonder goal!!!! Bayern Munich's Shin Jae-wook scores a fantastic goal! On the other hand, Nemanja Vidić looked pitiful. └ I've always said it. Shin Jae-wook is one of the world's top strikers! And soon, he'll become the world's best striker that no one can match! └ Damn! I'm starting to envy Korea. To have such an amazing player! Shin Jae-wook, who excited everyone and changed the atmosphere of the stadium. He received congratulations from his more excited teammates and looked up into the sky. Messages were being generated there. ‘The number of messages is different because it's the Champions League quarterfinals.’ Several messages adorned the air. Of course, only two messages caught Shin Jae-wook's eye. [Trait grows!] ['Supreme Concentration (A)' grows into 'Extreme Concentration (S)'.] [Trait grows!] ['Solid Body (C)' grows into 'Miraculous Body (B)'.]"},{"instruction":"172 * * * 경기장에 들어온 이택현이 실실 웃으며 동료들에게 감독의 지시를 전달했다. 그 모습을 본 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들은 이택현의 이름을 외치며 환호했다. “이택현! 맨체스터 유나이티드의 측면을 시원하게 휘저어줘!” “쟤 진짜 잘하잖아! 특히 요즘 하는 거 보면 드리블은 아르연 로번보다 더 잘하는 거 같아.” “아르연 로번은 패턴이 자주 읽히잖아. 근데 이택현은 상대 수비수가 잘 읽질 못해. 드리블 실력에서는 로번보다 좋지 않을 수도 있지만, 양발잡이거든.” “양발잡이 드리블러는 사기지! 가서 맨유를 부숴버려!” “택현은 매번 시원시원한 플레이를 보여줘서 좋아!” ― 이택현 선수가 팬들에게 굉장히 환영받네요! 아직 바이에른 뮌헨 내에서 주전선수라고 말하긴 어렵지만, 매번 특급 조커 역할은 해주는 선수거든요? 경기당 공격포인트 숫자도 아주 많고요! ― 오늘 아르연 로번 선수의 돌파 시도가 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비수들에게 많이 막혔거든요? 하지만 이택현 선수는 항상 좋은 드리블 돌파를 보여줬었기 때문에, 오늘도 분명 좋은 모습을 보여줄 거라고 믿습니다! 이택현은 팬들의 환호를 받으며 더욱 즐거워했다. 평소보다 긴장도 덜 한 모습이었다. 그런 이택현을 지켜보던 신재욱은 만족스러운 표정으로 고개를 끄덕였다. ‘잘하겠네.’ 긴장하지 않고 제대로 실력을 발휘하는 이택현은 대단한 선수다. ‘솔직히 경험이 부족해서 그렇지, 실력만 놓고 보면 이미 분데스리가 최고 수준의 윙어야.’ 드리블과 패스, 슈팅, 기술, 피지컬, 오프더볼 움직임 모두 좋은 선수였으니까. 스트라이커인 신재욱에게는 너무나도 큰 도움이 되는 선수였다. 그래서 이택현을 불렀다. “택현아.” “재욱쓰! 와이?” “기대할게.” 짧고 굵은 말. 그거면 충분했다. 이택현의 기세를 끌어올리기엔. “엉? 기대…한다고? 좋아! 재욱쓰, 딱 기다려! 이 이택현 님이 보여줄게! 맨유 측면 다 털어버리고 꿀패스 넣어줄 테니까 페널티박스 안에서 편안하게 누워있어.” 하하! 신재욱이 웃음을 터트렸다. 기세가 잔뜩 올라서 떠들어대는 이택현의 모습은 웬만한 개그맨보다도 재밌었다. 하지만 이택현의 말을 의심하진 않았다. 조금은 과장되긴 했지만, 비슷하겐 해낼 수 있는 실력이 있는 선수였으니까. 그때였다. 신재욱의 눈빛이 변했다. 맨체스터 유나이티드의 움직임이 바뀐 것을 포착했기 때문이었다. ― 맨체스터 유나이티드가 이제는 라인을 올리네요! ― 경기에서 승리하려면 골을 넣어야 하니까요. 눌러앉아 있는 건 이제는 도움이 되지 않습니다. ― 이젠 맨체스터 유나이티드의 적극적인 공격을 볼 수 있겠는데요? 해설들의 말처럼 맨체스터 유나이티드는 라인을 올리며 공격적으로 경기를 운영했다. 특히 측면 공격을 자주 시도하며 어떻게든 동점 골을 터트리겠다는 의지를 드러냈다. 그러나 바이에른 뮌헨의 측면 수비는 단단했다. 맨체스터 유나이티드의 양쪽 윙어 애슐리 영과 발렌시아가 꾸준히 돌파를 시도했지만, 바이에른 뮌헨의 하피냐와 다비드 알라바는 집중력을 잃지 않았다. 더군다나 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 부임한 이후로 수비형 미드필더로도 자주 뛰게 된 필립 람이 수비수들을 지켜주기까지 했다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 굉장히 단단한 수비를 보여주고 있습니다! 맨체스터 유나이티드가 열심히 공격을 시도하고 있지만, 번번이 막히네요! ― 필립 람의 움직임이 예술인데요? 이 선수는 세계 최고의 풀백인데, 이번 시즌엔 수비형 미드필더로서도 높은 클래스를 보여주고 있습니다! ― 괴물 같은 선수죠. 대단한 멀티플레이어입니다. 수비가 안정되다 보니, 공격을 전개하는 선수들에게도 부담이 없었다. 공격하다가 뺏기더라도 뒤에 있는 동료들이 막아준다는 믿음. 그런 믿음이 있기에, 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격은 더욱 날카로웠다. 특히 이택현은 보는 사람이 놀랄 정도로 과감하게 돌파를 시도했다. ― 이택현 선수! 자신감이 대단한데요? 공을 잡기만 하면 망설임 없이 돌파를 시도하고 있습니다! ― 지금도 돌파를……오오! 성공했습니다! 신재욱 선수가 오른쪽 측면을 뚫어냈습니다! 벌써 세 번째 돌파 시도입니다! 오른쪽으로 파고든 이택현이 더욱 속도를 높였다. 깊숙한 곳으로 빠른 속도로 침투했다. 상대 중앙수비수를 끌어들이기 위한 움직임이었다. ― 이택현 선수! 굉장히 빠릅니다! 맨체스터 유나이티드, 위기인데요? ― 수비수가 나와야죠! 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비수들은 이택현 선수가 좋은 양발 슈팅 능력을 지녔다는 걸 알아야 합니다! 이택현은 슈팅 능력이 좋은 선수였고. 그 사실을 알고 있는 맨체스터 유나이티드의 중앙수비수 리오 퍼디난드는 이택현을 막기 위해 움직였다. 어쩔 수 없는 선택이었지만, 리오 퍼디낸드에겐 나름의 생각이 있었다. ‘이 녀석, 자신감이 넘쳐. 공만 잡으면 돌파를 시도하는 녀석이라 나를 상대로도 뚫으려고 할 수도 있어.’ 이택현이 또다시 돌파를 시도할 거라는 예상. 그러나 그 예상은 틀렸다. 리오 퍼디난드가 튀어나오자마자, 이택현은 기다렸다는 듯 패스를 뿌렸다. “재욱아! 꿀패스 배달이요!” * * * 빠르게 굴러오는 공을 보며, 신재욱은 미소를 지었다. ‘영악한 친구야.’ 여러 번의 과감한 돌파 시도를 한 뒤, 지금처럼 중요한 순간에 패스를 선택하며 베테랑인 리오 퍼디낸드마저 속여버렸다. 매번 함께 훈련하는 동료이기에, 신재욱은 알고 있었다. 전부 이택현의 빌드업이었다는 것을. ‘이런 무모한 빌드업을 할 수 있을 정도로 실력이 있는 친구이기도 하지.’ 신재욱은 미소를 지은 채, 굴러오는 공을 향해 다리를 휘둘렀다. 굉장히 받기 쉬운 패스였다. 가볍게 밀어 넣기만 하면 골을 넣을 수 있게 되는 꿀패스. ― 고오오오오오올! 신재욱 선수의 골입니다! 이러면 맨체스터 유나이티드가 1차전을 바이에른 뮌헨에게 내주겠는데요? 스코어는 이제 3 대 1이 됐습니다! ― 이야……! 이택현 선수가 신재욱 선수에게 골을 만들어줬네요! 돌파부터 패스까지 전부 완벽했습니다! 과르디올라 감독이 아르연 로번 대신 이택현을 투입한 이유를 확실히 알 것 같습니다! ― 이택현 선수는 재능도 뛰어나지만, 평소에 훈련을 굉장히 열심히 하는 것으로도 유명한 선수거든요? 그 노력이 챔피언스리그 8강에서도 잘 드러난 것 같습니다! 골을 넣은 지금. 신재욱은 골대 안을 향해 달려가 공을 집어 들었다. 그리고 평소처럼 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었다. 그런데 평소와는 다른 행동을 했다. “이택현!” 원래라면 직접 공을 들고 경기장 중앙으로 뛰었겠지만, 지금은 이택현에게 공을 던졌다. 그리고 이택현은 씨익 웃으며 공을 받아냈다. “재욱쓰! 꿀패스 인정?” “인정. 같이 뛰자.” “좋지!” 이어서 둘은 경기장 중앙을 향해 함께 뛰었고. 그 뒤를 바이에른 뮌헨 동료들이 기뻐하며 따라왔다. ― 신재욱 선수가 이택현 선수에게 공을 넘겨줍니다! 두 선수가 함께 뛰네요! 신재욱 선수가 이택현 선수에게 고마움을 표현한 것 같죠? ― 하하! 그렇게 보이네요! 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수, 그리고 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 모두 경기장 중앙으로 뛰고 있습니다! ― 정말 장관이네요! 신재욱 선수가 골을 넣을 때마다 보는 장면이지만, 볼 때마다 멋있는 것 같습니다! 챔피언스리그 8강이라는 무대. 그곳에서 맨체스터 유나이티드를 상대로 이택현이 어시스트를 하고, 신재욱이 골을 넣었다는 것. 그 사실에 실시간으로 경기를 보던 한국축구팬들은 미친 듯 열광했다. └ 오!!!!!!!!!!! ㅅㅂ오진다!!!!!! 이택현이랑 신재욱 호흡 좀 봐봐ㄷㄷㄷㄷ 얘네 걍 텔레파시 통하는 거 아니야?ㄷㄷㄷㄷ └ 너무 잘한다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이택현은 왜 선발로 안 나온 거야? 아르연 로번보다 훨씬 잘하는데?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 이렇게 후반전에 폭발적으로 하라고 늦게 내보낸 듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그거 아니고선 설명이 안 돼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 고오오오오오오오올!!!!!!!!!!! 신재욱 2골!!!!!!! 얜 이런 거 절대 안 놓치지! └ 패스가 진짜진짜 좋았어ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이택현 ㅁㅊ놈ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 오늘 컨디션 엄청 좋은 듯! └ 맨유 오늘 멸망!!!!!! 이러면 맨유는 2차전에서도 별로 희망이 없지! 3 대 1 스코어가 된 이후. 경기의 흐름은 완전히 바이에른 뮌헨 쪽으로 넘어왔다. 힘을 내려던 맨체스터 유나이티드 선수들은 기세가 한풀 꺾인 모습을 보였다. 골을 넣어야 하는 맨체스터 유나이티드였지만, 더는 적극적인 공격을 시도하지 못했다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진이 보여주는 움직임이 너무나도 날카로웠기 때문이었다. 삐이이이익! 경기가 종료됐다. 추가 골은 없었다. 맨체스터 유나이티드가 수비적인 운영으로 완전히 내려앉으며 2차전에서의 역전을 노렸고. 바이에른 뮌헨도 굳이 무리하지 않고 안정적인 운영을 펼친 결과였다. ― 챔피언스리그 8강 1차전은 바이에른 뮌헨이 승리를 가져갑니다! 신재욱 선수와 슈바인슈타이거 선수의 골로 3 대 1 스코어로 마무리가 됐습니다! * * * 맨체스터 유나이티드와의 챔피언스리그 8강 1차전 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨은 분데스리가에서 아우크스부르크를 만나 힘든 경기를 치렀다. 체력이 떨어진 주전선수들을 대거 빼고 경기를 치렀기 때문이었다. 다만 힘든 경기 끝에 승리는 가져왔다. 원래라면 쉬었어야 했지만, 어쩔 수 없이 후반전에 투입된 주전선수들의 활약 덕분이었다. 「신재욱, 극적인 어시스트로 팀을 구해!」 「축구천재 신재욱, 후반 35분에 투입돼서 팀의 연승을 이어갈 중요한 어시스트 기록! 프랑크 리베리, ‘신재욱의 패스가 환상적이었다.’라며 신재욱을 칭찬해.」 분데스리가 29연승. 현재 바이에른 뮌헨이 이뤄낸 기록이었다. 그리고 며칠 뒤. 주전선수들의 체력을 회복하는 것에 성공한 바이에른 뮌헨은 챔피언스리그 8강 2차전에서 좋은 경기력을 보여주며 4강에 올랐다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 챔피언스리그 8강 2차전에서도 맨체스터 유나이티드 꺾고 챔피언스리그 4강 진출!」 「호셉 과르디올라 감독, ‘우린 분데스리가와 챔피언스리그 모두 우승만을 바라보고 있다.’라며 우승에 대한 강한 자신감 드러내!」 챔피언스리그 4강 진출. 이와 같은 결과에 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들은 기뻐했다. 그러나 이들의 기쁨은 오래가지 못했다. 4강전의 대진 추첨 결과가 나왔기 때문이었다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 챔피언스리그 4강에서 레알 마드리드와 만난다!」 「세계 최고의 팀들인 레알 마드리드와 바이에른 뮌헨이 만났다! 챔피언스리그 결승에 오를 팀은?」 레알 마드리드. 현재 최강의 스쿼드를 지녔다고 평가받는 팀. 그 팀이 바로 바이에른 뮌헨의 챔피언스리그 4강전 상대였다. 그리고 이 사실에 바이에른 뮌헨의 선수들조차 긴장감을 드러냈다. “레알 마드리드랑 만나게 됐구나. 쉽지 않겠어.” “……죽어라 뛰어야겠군.” “힘든 상대가 잡혔네. 대진운이 별로야.” “걔네 요즘 되게 잘하던데…….” 그런데 신재욱만큼은 달랐다. 모든 선수가 긴장감을 드러내는 상황에서 혼자만 웃고 있었다. ‘레알 마드리드라니, 너무 좋은데?’","output":"172 --- Lee Taek-hyun entered the stadium with a grin, passing on the manager's instructions to his teammates. Seeing this, Bayern Munich's fans cheered and chanted Lee Taek-hyun's name. \\"Lee Taek-hyun! Sweep through Manchester United's flanks!\\" \\"He's really good! Especially his dribbling lately, it seems even better than Arjen Robben's.\\" \\"Arjen Robben's patterns are often read by opponents. But Lee Taek-hyun is unpredictable. He might not be better than Robben in dribbling skills, but he's ambidextrous.\\" \\"An ambidextrous dribbler is a cheat code! Go and crush Man U!\\" \\"I love how Taek-hyun always plays so refreshingly!\\" ― Lee Taek-hyun is receiving a tremendous welcome from the fans! It's hard to call him a starter in Bayern Munich yet, but he always plays the role of a super sub, doesn't he? He also has a very high number of offensive points per game! ― Today, Arjen Robben's breakthrough attempts have been blocked a lot by Manchester United's defenders, right? But Lee Taek-hyun has always shown good dribbling breakthroughs, so I believe he will show a great performance today too! Lee Taek-hyun was even more delighted by the cheers of the fans. He seemed less nervous than usual. Watching Lee Taek-hyun, Shin Jae-wook nodded with a satisfied expression. 'He'll do well.' Lee Taek-hyun, who can perform properly without being nervous, is an incredible player. 'Honestly, if it weren't for the lack of experience, he's already one of the best wingers in the Bundesliga based on skill alone.' Dribbling, passing, shooting, technique, physicality, off-the-ball movement—he was good at everything. For striker Shin Jae-wook, he was an immensely helpful player. So he called out to Lee Taek-hyun. \\"Taek-hyun.\\" \\"Jae-wook! Why?\\" \\"I'm counting on you.\\" A short and powerful message. That was enough. To boost Lee Taek-hyun's morale. \\"Huh? You're counting on me? Great! Jae-wook, just wait! This Lee Taek-hyun will show you! I'll sweep through Man U's flanks and send you a sweet pass, so just lie down comfortably in the penalty box.\\" Ha ha! Shin Jae-wook burst into laughter. Lee Taek-hyun's boastful demeanor was more entertaining than most comedians. But Shin Jae-wook didn't doubt his words. Although a bit exaggerated, Lee Taek-hyun had the skill to pull it off. That's when it happened. Shin Jae-wook's eyes changed. He had caught a shift in Manchester United's movements. ― Manchester United is raising their line now! ― They have to score to win the game. Sitting back won't help them anymore. ― Now we can see Manchester United's aggressive attack, right? As the commentators said, Manchester United played more offensively by raising their line. Especially, they frequently attempted attacks from the flanks, showing their determination to score an equalizing goal. However, Bayern Munich's flank defense was solid. Although Manchester United's wingers Ashley Young and Valencia consistently tried to break through, Bayern Munich's Rafinha and David Alaba did not lose focus. Moreover, since Pep Guardiola took over as manager, Philipp Lahm, who often played as a defensive midfielder, also protected the defenders. ― Bayern Munich is showing a very solid defense! Manchester United is trying hard to attack, but they are being blocked every time! ― Philipp Lahm's movement is artistic, isn't it? He's the world's best fullback, but this season he's also showing high class as a defensive midfielder! ― He's a monster of a player. An incredible multi-player. With the defense being stable, the attacking players also felt less pressure. The belief that even if they lost the ball while attacking, their teammates behind them would block it. With such confidence, Bayern Munich's attacks were even sharper. Especially Lee Taek-hyun, who attempted breakthroughs so boldly that it surprised the spectators. ― Lee Taek-hyun! He's full of confidence, isn't he? As soon as he gets the ball, he attempts to break through without hesitation! ― He's breaking through again... Oh! He's succeeded! Lee Taek-hyun has pierced through the right flank! This is already his third attempt! Lee Taek-hyun increased his speed as he penetrated to the right. He infiltrated deep into the area at high speed, aiming to draw in the opposing central defenders. ― Lee Taek-hyun! He's incredibly fast! Is Manchester United in trouble? ― The defenders have to come out! Manchester United's defenders should know that Lee Taek-hyun has good shooting ability with both feet! Lee Taek-hyun was a player with good shooting ability. Knowing this, Manchester United's central defender Rio Ferdinand moved to block Lee Taek-hyun. It was an inevitable choice, but Ferdinand had his own thoughts. 'This guy is overflowing with confidence. Since he attempts to break through as soon as he gets the ball, he might try to breach me too.' Ferdinand anticipated another breakthrough attempt from Lee Taek-hyun. However, his expectation was wrong. As soon as Ferdinand stepped out, Lee Taek-hyun passed the ball as if he had been waiting for it. \\"Jae-wook! Honey pass delivery!\\" --- Watching the ball roll quickly towards him, Shin Jae-wook smiled. 'Clever guy.' After several bold breakthrough attempts, he chose to pass at this crucial moment, even deceiving the veteran Rio Ferdinand. As a teammate who trained with him every day, Shin Jae-wook knew. It was all Lee Taek-hyun's buildup. 'He has the skill to make such a reckless buildup.' Shin Jae-wook smiled and swung his leg at the rolling ball. It was a very easy pass to receive. A sweet pass that only needed a light push to score a goal. ― Goooaal! It's a goal by Shin Jae-wook! With this, Manchester United will have to concede the first leg to Bayern Munich, right? The score is now 3 to 1! ― Wow...! Lee Taek-hyun has created a goal for Shin Jae-wook! From the breakthrough to the pass, everything was perfect! It's clear why Guardiola substituted Lee Taek-hyun for Arjen Robben! ― Lee Taek-hyun is not only talented but also famous for training very hard, right? It seems his efforts are showing in the Champions League quarterfinals too! Now, having scored the goal. Shin Jae-wook ran towards the goal, picked up the ball, and as usual, ran to the center of the field. But he did something different from usual. \\"Lee Taek-hyun!\\" Normally, he would have carried the ball to the center of the field himself, but this time he threw the ball to Lee Taek-hyun. And Lee Taek-hyun caught the ball with a grin. \\"Jae-wook! Do you acknowledge the honey pass?\\" \\"Acknowledged. Let's run together.\\" \\"Great!\\" Then the two ran together towards the center of the field. And their Bayern Munich teammates followed, celebrating joyfully. ― Shin Jae-wook passes the ball to Lee Taek-hyun! The two players are running together! It seems like Shin Jae-wook is expressing his gratitude to Lee Taek-hyun, right? ― Ha ha! It looks like it! Shin Jae-wook, Lee Taek-hyun, and all the Bayern Munich players are running to the center of the field! ― It's a magnificent sight! We see this every time Shin Jae-wook scores, but it always looks cool! On the stage of the Champions League quarterfinals. The fact that Lee Taek-hyun assisted and Shin Jae-wook scored against Manchester United. Korean football fans watching the game live went wild with excitement. └ Oh!!!!!!!!!!! Damn, this is amazing!!!!!! Look at the synergy between Lee Taek-hyun and Shin Jae-wookㅠㅠㅠㅠ Are they telepathic or what?ㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ They're so goodㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Why didn't Lee Taek-hyun start? He's way better than Arjen Robben, right?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Seems like they put him in late to explode in the second halfㅋㅋㅋㅋ There's no other explanationㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Goooaal!!!!!!!!!!! Shin Jae-wook's second goal!!!!!!! He never misses these! └ The pass was really, really goodㅋㅋㅋㅋ Lee Taek-hyun is crazyㅋㅋㅋㅋ He seems to be in great condition today! └ Man U is doomed today!!!!!! With this, Man U doesn't have much hope for the second leg! After the score became 3 to 1. The flow of the game completely shifted to Bayern Munich's side. The Manchester United players, who were trying to rally, showed signs of losing momentum. Although Manchester United needed to score, they could no longer attempt aggressive attacks. Because Bayern Munich's attackers were too sharp. Whistle! The game ended. There were no additional goals. Manchester United settled into a defensive stance, aiming for a comeback in the second leg. Bayern Munich also did not push too hard and played a stable game. ― Bayern Munich wins the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals! The game ends with a score of 3 to 1 with goals from Shin Jae-wook and Schweinsteiger! --- After the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals against Manchester United. Bayern Munich had a tough game against Augsburg in the Bundesliga. This was because they played without many of their main players who were low on stamina. However, they managed to win after a tough game. It was thanks to the efforts of the main players who had to play in the second half, even though they should have rested. 「Shin Jae-wook saves the team with a dramatic assist!」 「Football genius Shin Jae-wook records an important assist that continues the team's winning streak after being substituted in the 35th minute of the second half! Franck Ribéry praises Shin Jae-wook, saying, 'His pass was fantastic.'」 29 consecutive Bundesliga wins. That was the record Bayern Munich had achieved. And a few days later. Having successfully recovered the stamina of the main players, Bayern Munich showed good performance in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinals and advanced to the semifinals. 「Bayern Munich defeats Manchester United in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinals and advances to the semifinals!」 「Pep Guardiola, 'We are only aiming for victory in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League,' showing strong confidence in winning!」 Advancing to the Champions League semifinals. Bayern Munich's fans were delighted with such a result. However, their joy did not last long. The draw for the semifinals was announced. 「Bayern Munich to face Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals!」 「The world's top teams, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, have met! Which team will advance to the Champions League final?」 Real Madrid. The team currently considered to have the strongest squad. That team was Bayern Munich's opponent in the Champions League semifinals. And this fact even made Bayern Munich's players show signs of tension. \\"We're up against Real Madrid. It won't be easy.\\" \\"…We'll have to run ourselves to death.\\" \\"We've got a tough opponent. Our draw luck isn't great.\\" \\"They've been playing really well lately…\\" But Shin Jae-wook was different. While all the players showed signs of nervousness, he was the only one smiling. 'Real Madrid, huh? That's great.'"},{"instruction":"Переведи на китайский и подробно объясни: Неужели прошла моя алая молодость, И почему-то не забудется та весенняя светлость.","output":"Ваш текст на китайский язык будет звучать так: 难道我的鲜红青春已逝去， 为何那春日的明媚依旧难以忘怀。 Перевод по частям: 1. \\"难道我的鲜红青春已逝去\\" (Nándào wǒ de xiānhóng qīngchūn yǐ shì qù) означает \\"Неужели моя алая молодость уже прошла\\".

Welcome to our session on 'Understanding Multiple Sclerosis,' a journey through the science, the symptoms, and the solutions of MS. I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to share some important insights and updates with all of you today.\\" [Slide 2: Introduction to MS] Speaker: \\"Let's begin with a brief introduction. Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic, sometimes debilitating disease that can affect anyone, although it most commonly affects individuals between the ages of 20 and 50. Women are also more likely to be diagnosed with MS than men. The effects of MS can be wide-ranging, and managing the disease is often a lifelong process.\\" [Slide 3: What is MS?] Speaker: \\"So, what exactly is Multiple Sclerosis? MS is an autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system, which comprises the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Essentially, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, specifically the protective sheath known as myelin that covers nerve fibers. This can lead to communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body, potentially causing permanent damage to these nerves.\\" [Slide 4: Causes of MS] Speaker: \\"Although the precise cause of MS is still unknown, scientists believe that it's likely due to a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. These environmental factors could be anything from viral infections to vitamin D deficiency. Even smoking has been implicated as a risk factor for developing MS. While we do not have all the answers, the ongoing research is making strides in understanding these complex interactions.\\" [Slide 5: Symptoms of MS] Speaker: \\"Now, moving on to symptoms. MS is known for its variability: each person's experience with the disease is unique. Symptoms can be mild, such as numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. Other common symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, muscle weakness, and difficulty with coordination and balance. Moreover, symptoms can be unpredictable, with episodes of worsening and improvement.\\" [Slide 6: Current Treatment Options] Speaker: \\"Despite there being no cure for MS yet, we have made significant progress in managing the disease and improving quality of life for those affected. The current treatment options for MS can be categorized into a few groups: disease-modifying therapies, symptom management medications, and lifestyle adjustments.\\" [Slide 7: Disease-Modifying Therapies] Speaker: \\"Disease-modifying therapies, or DMTs, are the frontline in MS treatment. They are designed to slow the disease's progression and decrease the frequency and severity of attacks. These include various forms of medication, such as injectables, infusions, and oral medications.\\" [Slide 8: Symptom Management] Speaker: \\"Symptom management is also crucial. Treatments here can range from physical therapy to help maintain mobility, to medications that specifically address issues like muscle stiffness, fatigue, and pain. Mental health support is equally important, as the psychological impact of MS can be significant.\\" [Slide 9: Lifestyle Adjustments] Speaker: \\"Lastly, lifestyle adjustments can make a substantial difference. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and smoking cessation are all advised. Additionally, strategies to cool down the body can be beneficial, as heat can worsen symptoms.\\" [Slide 10: Conclusion] Speaker: \\"In conclusion, while MS is a complex and challenging disease, ongoing research is offering hope for new treatments and, ultimately, a cure. Through a combined approach of DMTs, symptom management, and lifestyle choices, people with MS are living fuller, more active lives than ever before.\\" [Slide 11: Questions and Additional Resources] Speaker: \\"Thank you for your attention. I'd now like to open the floor to any questions you may have. Additionally, there are resources available for those looking for further information or support regarding MS; please feel free to reach out after the presentation, and I'll be happy to provide you with them.\\" [Slide 12: Contact Information] (On-screen text: \\"[Your Name], [Your Contact Information], [Any Relevant Organizations or Resources]\\") Speaker: \\"If you'd like to discuss more one-on-one or have any further inquiries, here's my contact information. I encourage you to stay connected and informed. Together, we can continue to educate and support our community in the fight against Multiple Sclerosis. Thank you for joining me today.\\" (Every slide transition is accompanied by a momentary pause to allow for slide content review and speaker transition.)"},{"instruction":"Genes and environmental factors in Multiple sclerosis","output":"[Slide 1: Title Slide] (On-screen text: \\"Genes and Environmental Factors in Multiple Sclerosis\\") Speaker: \\"Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining today's presentation on the roles of genes and environmental factors in Multiple Sclerosis, also known as MS. My name is [Your Name], and together we'll explore how these elements contribute to the development of this complex condition.\\" [Slide 2: Understanding MS] Speaker: \\"Before diving into the specifics, let's briefly recap what MS is. MS is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system, leading to a wide range of symptoms that can impact physical and cognitive functions. It occurs when the immune system aberrantly attacks the myelin sheath, the protective covering of nerve fibers.\\" [Slide 3: The Genetic Component] Speaker: \\"On to our first key element: genetics. While MS is not directly inherited in the traditional sense, having a family member with MS does increase a person's risk, indicating that genetics do play a considerable role. Certain genes have been associated with an increased susceptibility to MS, with variations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex being the most notable. These genes are thought to be involved in regulating the immune system.\\" [Slide 4: Genetic Research in MS] Speaker: \\"Ongoing genetic research is continuously identifying new genes associated with MS risk. It's estimated there are now over 200 genes that show a modest association with the disease. Yet, inheriting these genes does not guarantee one will develop MS, which brings us to the second part of the equation: environmental factors.\\" [Slide 5: Environmental Risk Factors] Speaker: \\"Research has identified several environmental factors that may increase the risk of developing MS. These include Vitamin D deficiency, smoking, obesity, and viral infections—particularly the Epstein-Barr virus. Geographical location also plays a role, with MS being more prevalent in countries further from the equator.\\" [Slide 6: Vitamin D and Sunlight Exposure] Speaker: \\"Vitamin D, obtained primarily through sunlight exposure and diet, has long been observed to have an inverse relationship with MS risk. The farther away from the equator, the lesser the sunlight and, consequently, the higher the prevalence of MS. Supplementation and diet adjustments are under investigation as potential preventative measures.\\" [Slide 7: Smoking and Lifestyle Choices] Speaker: \\"Smoking is another significant risk factor. Research shows that smokers are more likely to develop MS and that smoking may also accelerate disease progression. Here, the modification of lifestyle choice comes into play as a prevention strategy.\\" [Slide 8: Infectious Agents] Speaker: \\"Infections, especially by the Epstein-Barr virus, have been linked to an increased risk of developing MS. The exact mechanism isn't clear, but it's believed that the immune response to such infections may inadvertently trigger an autoimmune response against the nervous system in genetically predisposed individuals.\\" [Slide 9: Obesity and Early Life Factors] Speaker: \\"Childhood and adolescent obesity have also been associated with a higher risk of MS. The reasons behind this aren't completely understood but may be related to the impact of obesity on immune function and the aforementioned Vitamin D metabolism.\\" [Slide 10: Interaction Between Genetics and Environment] Speaker: \\"The key takeaway is that the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental exposures influences the risk and progression of MS. It's an intricate interplay that is the subject of intensive research, aiming to understand how we might protect at-risk individuals or improve treatment.\\" [Slide 11: Ongoing Research and Future Directions] Speaker: \\"Ongoing studies are examining these genetic and environmental factors in more depth, with the hope of developing personalized medicine strategies, better preventative measures, and ultimately, a cure.\\" [Slide 12: Conclusion and Questions] Speaker: \\"In conclusion, both our genes and environment play crucial roles in the development of MS. By continuing to unravel how these elements interact, we can move closer to preventing, managing, and eventually curing this disease. Thank you for your attention. I'll now take any questions.\\" [Slide 13: Contact Information and Resources] (On-screen text: \\"[Your Name], [Your Contact Information], [Any Relevant Organizations or Resources]\\") Speaker: \\"For further information or support related to MS, please feel free to use the contact information provided here. I encourage you to reach out and stay informed on this important topic.\\" (Every slide transition is accompanied by a brief pause for questions or comments from the audience before moving on to the next.)"},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"Certainly!

[극도의 집중력] [등급] S [효과] 운동을 할 때, 대단히 높은 집중력을 가집니다. 또한, 집중력이 필요한 모든 상황에서 최고의 효율을 얻게 됩니다. 슈팅과 패스의 정확도가 높아지고, 여러 상황에서의 타이밍과 볼 컨트롤이 좋아집니다. [경이로운 신체] [등급] B [효과] 몸싸움이 매우 좋아지고, 어지간해선 다치지 않게 됩니다. 메시지를 확인한 지금. 신재욱의 얼굴에 지어져 있던 미소는 더욱 짙어졌다. 큰 기대를 하고 있었는데도 성장한 특성들의 효과에 적힌 내용은 굉장히 만족스러웠다. “되게 좋네. 두 특성 모두 큰 도움이 되겠어.” 그렇게 말하며, 신재욱은 허공에 뜬 메시지들을 전부 치워버렸다. 곧 경기가 재개될 것이기에 다시 경기에 집중해야 했다. 그래서 그는 여전히 흥분해있는 동료들을 진정시키기 시작했다. “다들 진정 좀 해봐요. 바스티안! 이제 자리로 돌아가야 해요!” 같은 시각. 경기를 지켜보던 한국축구팬들은 신재욱의 골에 놀라움을 드러내고 있었다. └ 와ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이거 챔피언스리그 8강 맞아? 상대 맨체스터 유나이티드 맞아? 오늘따라 왜 저렇게 약한 것처럼 보이지? 그만큼 신재욱이 잘한다는 건가? └ 이번 시즌의 맨체스터 유나이티드는 별로 세지 않은 게 맞긴 해. 근데 신재욱이 상대를 더 약해 보이게 만든 것도 맞는 듯. 네마냐 비디치 봐봐. 쟨 늙긴 했지만, 절대 쉽게 뚫을 수 있는 수비수가 아니야. 근데 신재욱은 화려한 드리블로 쉽게 뚫어버리잖아. 그게 다 실력인 거. └ 신재욱은 플레이가 되게 여유롭다. 얜 긴장도 안 되나 봐ㅋㅋㅋ 다비드 데헤아까지 제치고 골을 넣네. └ 신재욱이 프리미어리그에 오면 못할 거라고 하던 놈들은 많이 놀랐는데?ㅎㅎㅎ 프리미어리그의 명문팀인 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비진을 그냥 뚫어버리고 골을 넣어버렸잖아ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 재욱이가 지금 한국 나이로 20살인가? └ ㅇㅇㅇㅇ맞아. 신재욱 한국 나이 20살임. 유럽 나이는 18살이고. └ 아직도 진짜 어리네;;;;; 실력은 이제 세계적인 수준으로 성장한 것 같은데 말이야;;;; └ 신재욱 플레이는 볼 때마다 놀라워ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 특히 오늘은 챔피언스리그 8강인데 여기서도 이렇게 잘하네. 확실히 천재는 상식을 뛰어넘는 것 같다니까? └ 경기 본 사람들은 전부 놀랐겠네. 맨체스터 유나이티드의 팬들은 좀 슬프겠지만. 그때였다. 한국축구팬들은 잠시 이야기를 멈췄다. 경기가 재개됐기 때문이었다. ― 신재욱 선수에게 선제골을 허용한 맨체스터 유나이티드가 급하지 않게 경기를 운영하네요? ― 지금까지 바이에른 뮌헨에게 골을 넣기 위해 무리한 공격을 하다가 오히려 역습당했던 팀들이 많지 않습니까? 하지만 맨체스터 유나이티드는 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습을 철저히 경계하고 있는 것처럼 보입니다! ― 다른 팀들처럼 당하지는 않겠다는 거겠죠? 그러나 결국 경기에서 승리하려면 골을 넣어야 할 텐데요! 해설들의 말처럼 맨체스터 유나이티드의 선수들은 신중하게 움직였다. 도전적인 패스를 하기보단 안전한 패스를 주고받으며 아주아주 천천히 공격을 전개했다. 그런 상황이었기에 바이에른 뮌헨도 바쁠 건 없었다. 적당히 상대를 압박하며 지역방어 위주의 수비를 펼쳤다. 이때, 신재욱은 이런 상황이 마음에 들지 않는다는 듯 입맛을 다셨다. ‘느리긴 하지만 맨체스터 유나이티드가 조금씩 흐름을 가져가고 있어. 이러다가 갑자기 속도를 높여서 공격하면 당해버릴 수도 있겠는데?’ 여러 경험으로 알고 있었다. 이런 분위기를 오래 끌고 가는 건 좋지 못하다는 것을. 그래서 신재욱은 호셉 과르디올라 감독을 바라보며 신호를 보냈다. 휘익! 휙! 몇 번의 손짓을 하며, 맨체스터 유나이티드를 강하게 압박하는 게 좋겠다는 뜻을 전했고. 과르디올라 감독은 고개를 끄덕이며 선수들을 향해 소리쳤다. “모두 강하게 압박하세요! 당장 상대의 흐름을 끊어요!” * * * 과르디올라 감독의 허락이 떨어진 직후. 신재욱은 동료들과 함께 전방압박을 시작했다. 계속해서 몸싸움이 펼쳐질 정도로 매우 적극적인 압박이었다. 그런데 이 과정에서 신재욱은 만족감을 느꼈다. ‘몸싸움이 꽤 좋아졌어.’ 조금 전에 특성이 성장하며 얻게 된 ‘경이로운 신체(B)’특성의 효과를 확인할 수 있었으니까. [경이로운 신체] [등급] B [효과] 몸싸움이 매우 좋아지고, 어지간해선 다치지 않게 됩니다. ‘어지간해선 다치지 않는다는 효과도 궁금하긴 하지만, 굳이 일부러 다칠 상황을 만들고 싶진 않아.’ 신재욱은 미소를 지은 채, 다시 공을 잡은 상대 선수를 향해 덤벼들었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 굉장히 강한 압박을 펼치고 있습니다! 특히 신재욱 선수가 아주 적극적으로 전방압박을 하네요! ― 맨체스터 유나이티드 선수들은 신재욱 선수의 압박을 조심할 필요가 있습니다. 신재욱 선수의 태클은 정말 무섭거든요! ― 하하! 여러 선수가 신재욱 선수의 태클에 당했죠. 열심히 뛰어다니며 상대를 압박하던 신재욱의 눈이 빛났다. 짧은 순간이지만, 그는 맨체스터 유나이티드의 측면 수비수 하파엘의 빈틈을 봤다. 그래서 그 즉시 몸을 던졌다. 매우 높은 성공률을 보유하고 있는 신재욱 특유의 슬라이딩 태클 시도였다. 촤아아악! 결과는 성공이었다. ― 우와아아아! 신재욱 선수가 공을 뺏어냈습니다! 하파엘 선수의 터치가 조금 길었는데, 그 순간을 놓치지 않고 바로 태클을 해서 공을 가져오네요! 이야~! 신재욱 선수! 마치 먹이를 낚아채는 맹수 같았습니다! 상대의 측면에서 공을 뺏어낸 상황. 신재욱은 이번에도 만족스러운 미소를 지었다. 태클을 할 때 이전과는 다른 느낌을 받았기 때문이었다. ‘이건 성장한 특성의 효과야. 분명 태클의 타이밍이 더 좋아졌어.’ 태클의 타이밍이 이전보다 좋아졌고, 자연스레 더 날카로운 태클을 할 수 있었다. 그래서 신재욱은 확신했다. 최고의 집중력(A) 특성에서 성장한 ‘극도의 집중력(S)’ 특성의 효과라고. [극도의 집중력] [등급] S [효과] 운동을 할 때, 대단히 높은 집중력을 가집니다. 또한, 집중력이 필요한 모든 상황에서 최고의 효율을 얻게 됩니다. 슈팅과 패스의 정확도가 높아지고, 여러 상황에서의 타이밍과 볼 컨트롤이 좋아집니다. 측면에서 하파엘의 공을 뺏은 지금. 신재욱은 미소를 지은 채로 크로스를 올렸다. 빠르게 침투하고 있는 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거의 머리를 향한 크로스였다. 크로스의 퀄리티는 훌륭했다. 날카롭게 휘어져 들어가면서도 슈바인슈타이거가 헤딩하기 좋은 위치로 날아갔으니까. 맨체스터 유나이티드엔 리오 퍼디낸드와 네마냐 비디치라는 훌륭한 수비수들이 있었지만. 터엉! 기습적으로 침투하며 머리를 가져다 대는 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거를 막아내지 못했다. ― 골! 들어갔습니다! 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거! 강력한 헤더로 맨체스터 유나이티드의 골문을 활짝 열었습니다! ― 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거 선수! 굉장히 기뻐하네요! ― 챔피언스리그에서 넣은 골이기 때문에 다른 경기에서 골을 넣었을 때보다 더 기쁠 수밖에 없을 겁니다! ― 그나저나 신재욱 선수의 패스도 대단했죠? 이 정도면 사실 택배 크로스라고 해도 될 것 같은데요? ― 굉장히 좋은 크로스였습니다! 골키퍼가 나오는 것도 애매하고, 수비수가 적극적으로 걷어내는 것도 애매해지는 위치로 날아갔거든요? 이런 크로스가 정말 좋은 크로스입니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 두 번째 골이 터진 지금. 경기장의 분위기가 뜨겁게 불타올랐다. ― 함성이 대단하네요! 바이에른 뮌헨은 응원하는 팬들이 선수들에게 거대한 함성을 보내고 있습니다! 팬들이 정말 기뻐하네요! ― 챔피언스리그 8강이니까요! 오오?! 관중들이 신재욱 선수의 이름을 부르고 있습니다! 허허! 골을 넣은 선수는 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거 선수인데, 어시스트를 한 신재욱 선수의 이름이 더 많이 나오네요? ― 그만큼 신재욱 선수의 플레이가 매우 좋았죠! 그리고 현재 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들 사이에서 신재욱 선수의 인기가 대단하기도 하고요! ― 최근 바이에른 뮌헨의 유니폼 판매 1위가 신재욱 선수의 유니폼이라고 하죠. 2 대 0으로 앞서가게 된 바이에른 뮌헨의 기세는 더욱 좋아졌다. 상대인 맨체스터 유나이티드를 끊임없이 압박했고, 더 많은 골을 노렸다. 그러나 맨체스터 유나이티드는 저력이 있는 팀이었다. 바이에른 뮌헨에게 밀리던 상황에서도 계속해서 기회를 노렸다. 마침내 전반전이 끝나기 3분 전, 맨체스터 유나이티드의 공격이 성공했다. ― 애슐리 영의 얼리 크로스입니다! 기습적인 크로스죠! 맨체스터 유나이티드의 윙어 애슐리 영이 갑자기 크로스를 올렸다. 깊숙한 측면이 아닌, 바깥쪽에서 올린 크로스. 워낙 빠른 타이밍에 나온 크로스였기 때문일까? 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비수들은 빠르게 반응하지 못했다. 또한, 페널티박스 안으로 침투한 로빈 판페르시의 움직임을 방해하지도 못했다. ― 들어갔습니다! 로빈! 판! 페르시! 맨체스터 유나이티드의 스트라이커가 바이에른 뮌헨의 골문을 열었습니다! ― 맨체스터 유나이티드가 간결한 플레이로 순식간에 골을 만들어내네요! 애슐리 영 선수의 얼리 크로스 타이밍도 굉장했고, 로빈 판페르시 선수의 헤더도 아주 정확했습니다! 아~! 이러면 경기가 더 재밌어지겠는데요? ― 하하! 그렇습니다. 즐겁게 경기를 지켜보던 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬분들도 이제는 긴장이 될 것 같습니다. 최근 맨체스터 유나이티드의 경기력이 떨어졌다고는 해도, 역시 이런 한 방이 있는 팀이네요. 이 경기, 결과를 쉽게 예상할 수 없게 됐습니다! 맨체스터 유나이티드의 골 이후, 전반전은 금방 종료됐고 후반전이 시작됐다. 후반전을 맞이한 양 팀은 각자의 방식으로 최선을 다했다. 바이에른 뮌헨은 높은 점유율을 유지하며 맨체스터 유나이티드의 수비진을 괴롭혔고. 맨체스터 유나이티드는 필사적으로 상대의 공격을 막아내며 역습기회를 노렸다. 양 팀 모두 집중력을 잃지 않았고, 추가득점 없이 시간이 흘렀다. 이때, 먼저 칼을 빼든 건 바이에른 뮌헨이었다. 호셉 과르디올라 감독은 컨디션이 좋지 않은 모습을 보여주던 아르연 로번을 빼고, 이택현을 투입했다. ― 이택현 선수가 들어가네요! 이러면 바이에른 뮌헨은 계속해서 공격적으로 하겠다는 것 같은데요? ― 그렇습니다. 수비적으로 하지 않고 더 많은 골을 만들겠다는 거죠. 관중석에서 함성이 터져 나왔다. 신재욱만큼은 아니더라도, 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들 사이에서 엄청난 인기를 지닌 이택현에게 쏟아지는 함성이었다. “친구들! 이택현 님이 왔습니다!” 이택현은 싱글벙글 웃으며 경기장으로 뛰어들어왔다. 그는 지금 챔피언스리그에서 뛸 수 있다는 것에 매우 기뻐하고 있었다. 그리고 그 모습을 본 신재욱도 미소를 지었다. ‘공격이 좀 더 편해지겠어.’ 손발이 잘 맞는 동료가 들어왔다는 것. 더 많은 골을 원하는 신재욱에겐 아주 좋은 일이었으니까. ‘오랜만에 능력치가 오를 수도 있겠는데?’","output":"171 --- Among the many messages, only two caught Shin Jaewook's attention. They were messages indicating that his traits had grown. \\"Two traits have grown!\\" Shin Jaewook checked the information of the grown traits with an expression full of anticipation. [Extreme Concentration] [Grade] S [Effect] When exercising, you have an extremely high level of concentration. Also, in all situations requiring concentration, you achieve the highest efficiency. The accuracy of shooting and passing improves, and timing and ball control in various situations get better. [Amazing Physique] [Grade] B [Effect] Your physical confrontations improve significantly, and you become less likely to get injured. Now that he had checked the messages, the smile on Shin Jaewook's face deepened. Even though he had high expectations, the effects of the grown traits were very satisfying. \\"These are really good. Both traits will be a big help.\\" Saying this, Shin Jaewook cleared away all the messages floating in the air. The game was about to resume, so he had to focus on the match again. Therefore, he began to calm down his still-excited teammates. \\"Everyone, calm down. Bastian! It's time to get back to your position!\\" At the same time. Korean soccer fans watching the game were expressing their amazement at Shin Jaewook's goal. └ Wowㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Is this really the Champions League quarterfinals? Are we really playing against Manchester United? Why do they look so weak today? Is it because Shin Jaewook is playing so well? └ This season's Manchester United isn't that strong, that's true. But it also seems like Shin Jaewook is making them look weaker. Look at Nemanja Vidic. He may be old, but he's not a defender you can easily break through. Yet, Shin Jaewook easily gets past him with his fancy dribbling. It's all skill. └ Shin Jaewook plays so relaxed. It's like he doesn't even get nervousㅋㅋㅋ He even scored past David de Gea. └ Those who said Shin Jaewook wouldn't make it in the Premier League must be surprised, huh?ㅎㅎㅎ He just broke through the defense of Manchester United, a prestigious Premier League team, and scoredㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Isn't Jaewook 20 years old in Korean age now? └ ㅇㅇㅇㅇ Right. Shin Jaewook is 20 years old in Korean age. He's 18 in European age. └ He's still really young;;;;; But it seems like his skills have grown to a world-class level now;;;; └ Every time I watch Shin Jaewook play, I'm amazedㅋㅋㅋㅋ Especially today in the Champions League quarterfinals, he's playing so well. It's like geniuses really do break the mold, you know? └ Everyone who watched the game must have been surprised. Fans of Manchester United might be a bit sad though. That's when it happened. The Korean soccer fans paused their conversation. The game had resumed. ― Manchester United, having conceded the opening goal to Shin Jaewook, is managing the game without rushing? ― Haven't there been many teams that have been counterattacked by Bayern Munich while trying to score with reckless attacks? But it seems like Manchester United is being very cautious of Bayern Munich's counterattacks! ― They don't want to be caught out like the other teams, do they? But in the end, they need to score to win the game! As the commentators said, the players of Manchester United moved cautiously. Instead of attempting challenging passes, they slowly developed their attack with safe passes. Bayern Munich wasn't in a hurry either. They pressed the opponent moderately and focused on zonal defense. At this moment, Shin Jaewook seemed displeased with the slow pace of the game. 'It's slow, but Manchester United is gradually taking control. If they suddenly speed up their attack, we could be caught off guard.' He knew from experience. Dragging out this kind of atmosphere wasn't good. So, Shin Jaewook looked at coach Josep Guardiola and signaled him. Whisk! Whisk! With a few hand gestures, he conveyed that it would be good to press Manchester United strongly. Coach Guardiola nodded and shouted at the players. \\"Everyone, press hard! Break their rhythm right now!\\" --- After receiving permission from coach Guardiola. Shin Jaewook began to press forward with his teammates. It was a very active press that led to constant physical confrontations. During this process, Shin Jaewook felt satisfied. 'The physical confrontations have improved.' He could feel the effect of the 'Amazing Physique (B)' trait that had grown earlier. [Amazing Physique] [Grade] B [Effect] Your physical confrontations improve significantly, and you become less likely to get injured. 'I'm curious about the effect of not getting injured easily, but I don't want to create a situation where I get hurt on purpose.' With a smile, Shin Jaewook charged again towards the opponent who had just taken possession of the ball. ― Bayern Munich is putting on a very strong press! Especially Shin Jaewook, who is very actively pressing forward! ― The players of Manchester United need to be careful of Shin Jaewook's pressure. His tackles are really scary! ― Haha! Many players have been caught by Shin Jaewook's tackles. While pressing the opponent energetically, Shin Jaewook's eyes sparkled. For a brief moment, he saw a gap in Manchester United's side-back Rafael. He immediately threw himself into action. It was an attempt at Shin Jaewook's signature sliding tackle, which had a very high success rate. Swoosh! The result was a success. ― Wowwww! Shin Jaewook has stolen the ball! Rafael's touch was a bit long, and Shin Jaewook didn't miss that moment, immediately tackling and taking the ball! Wow~! Shin Jaewook! Like a predator snatching its prey! Having stolen the ball on the side from Rafael. Shin Jaewook smiled satisfactorily again. He felt different when tackling than before. 'This is the effect of the grown trait. The timing of the tackle has definitely improved.' The timing of the tackle had improved compared to before, allowing him to execute sharper tackles. Therefore, Shin Jaewook was certain. It was the effect of the 'Extreme Concentration (S)' trait that had grown from the 'Highest Concentration (A)' trait. [Extreme Concentration] [Grade] S [Effect] When exercising, you have an extremely high level of concentration. Also, in all situations requiring concentration, you achieve the highest efficiency. The accuracy of shooting and passing improves, and timing and ball control in various situations get better. Now that he had stolen the ball from Rafael on the side. Shin Jaewook, still smiling, sent a cross. It was a cross aimed at the head of Bastian Schweinsteiger, who was quickly infiltrating. The quality of the cross was excellent. It curved sharply yet flew to a position that was good for Schweinsteiger to head. Manchester United had excellent defenders like Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. Boom! But they couldn't stop Bastian Schweinsteiger, who made a surprise run and headed the ball. ― Goal! It's in! Bastian Schweinsteiger! With a powerful header, he has opened up Manchester United's goal! ― Bastian Schweinsteiger is very happy! ― It's a goal in the Champions League, so it must be more joyful than scoring in other games! ― And Shin Jaewook's pass was amazing, wasn't it? At this point, you could even call it a delivery cross, right? ― It was a very good cross! It was awkward for the goalkeeper to come out, and it was also difficult for the defenders to clear it aggressively. This kind of cross is really a good cross! With Bayern Munich's second goal scored. The atmosphere in the stadium became even more heated. ― The cheers are tremendous! Bayern Munich's fans are sending a huge roar to the players! The fans are really happy! ― It's the Champions League quarterfinals! Oh?! The crowd is calling Shin Jaewook's name! Haha! The goal scorer is Bastian Schweinsteiger, but Shin Jaewook's name is being called out more? ― Shin Jaewook's play was very good! And currently, his popularity among Bayern Munich's fans is tremendous! ― Recently, the top-selling Bayern Munich uniform is Shin Jaewook's, they say. Bayern Munich's momentum, now leading 2-0, improved even more. They continuously pressured Manchester United and aimed for more goals. However, Manchester United was a team with resilience. Even while being pushed back by Bayern Munich, they kept looking for opportunities. Finally, 3 minutes before the end of the first half, Manchester United's attack succeeded. ― It's Ashley Young's early cross! A surprise cross! Manchester United's winger Ashley Young suddenly sent a cross. It wasn't from deep on the side but from the outside. Perhaps because it was such a quick cross? Bayern Munich's defenders couldn't react quickly enough. They also failed to disrupt Robin van Persie's movement as he infiltrated the penalty box. ― It's in! Robin! Van! Persie! Manchester United's striker has opened Bayern Munich's goal! ― Manchester United created a goal in an instant with concise play! Ashley Young's early cross timing was great, and Robin van Persie's header was very accurate! Ah~! This makes the game even more exciting, doesn't it? ― Haha! Yes. The Bayern Munich fans who were enjoying the game must be tense now. Although Manchester United's recent performance has declined, they still have this kind of punch. This game has become unpredictable! After Manchester United's goal, the first half ended quickly, and the second half began. Both teams did their best in their own ways in the second half. Bayern Munich maintained high possession and troubled Manchester United's defense. Manchester United desperately defended against the opponent's attacks and looked for counterattack opportunities. Both teams kept their concentration, and time passed without additional scoring. Then, Bayern Munich was the first to draw their sword. Coach Josep Guardiola took out Arjen Robben, who seemed to be in poor condition, and put in Lee Taekhyun. ― Lee Taekhyun is entering the game! It seems like Bayern Munich will continue to be aggressive, right? ― Yes. They're not playing defensively; they want to create more goals. Cheers erupted from the stands. Although not as much as Shin Jaewook, Lee Taekhyun received a tremendous cheer from Bayern Munich's fans. \\"Friends! Mr. Lee Taekhyun has arrived!\\" Lee Taekhyun entered the field with a beaming smile. He was very happy to be able to play in the Champions League now. And seeing that, Shin Jaewook also smiled. 'The attack will be more comfortable.' The fact that a well-coordinated teammate had entered. It was very good news for Shin Jaewook, who wanted more goals. 'Maybe my stats will increase after a long time?'"},{"instruction":"173 * * * 리그 29연승! 챔피언스리그 4강 진출! 이토록 대단한 일들을 해내면 자신감이 생길 수밖에 없다. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 그랬다. 이들에겐 어떤 팀을 만나도 이길 수 있다는 자신감이 있었다. 그런데 지금은 그렇지 않았다. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들의 얼굴엔 걱정이라는 감정이 드러나고 있었다. 「레알 마드리드 vs 바이에른 뮌헨, 챔피언스리그 준결승에서 만난다!」 챔피언스리그 4강전 대진 추첨 결과, 레알 마드리드를 만나게 됐다는 것 때문이었다. 세계 최고의 팀 중 하나인 레알 마드리드. 특히 선수들의 몸값만큼은 세계 최고라는 말이 가장 잘 어울리는 팀. 제아무리 바이에른 뮌헨의 선수들이라고 해도 긴장할 수밖에 없는 상대였다. 승리를 확신할 수 없는 상대였다. 그런데 신재욱의 반응은 달랐다. 다른 선수들과는 다르게 웃고 있었다. ‘레알 마드리드라니, 너무 좋은데?’ 그냥 웃는 게 아니고 진심으로 기뻐하고 있었다. ‘이 정도의 팀은 잡기만 하면 보약이지.’ 경기에서 승리한다면 성장에 큰 도움이 될 상대였기 때문이었다. ‘안 그래도 요즘 팀 성적이 좋아서 기분 좋았었는데.’ 이처럼 신재욱이 웃으면서 좋아하고 있자, 팀 동료들이 황당하다는 반응을 보였다. “재욱, 넌 상대가 레알 마드리드인데도 좋아? 전혀 긴장 안 돼?” “와…… 쟨 이번에도 긴장을 안 하네?” “흐흐! 신재욱은 어떻게 저럴 수가 있지? 레알 마드리드와 만나게 됐는데도 기분이 좋나 봐.” “재욱은 원래 저렇잖아. 근데 나도 저런 모습은 적응이 안 돼.” 그나마 익숙하다는 반응을 보인 건 이택현뿐이었다. “다들 왜 그래? 원래 저런 친구인 거 알았잖아? 신재욱은 상대가 레알 마드리드건 바르셀로나건 전혀 신경 안 써. 쟨 다 이길 수 있다고 생각한다고.” 같은 시각. 레알 마드리드와 바이에른 뮌헨이 챔피언스리그 4강에서 만나게 됐다는 소식을 접한 전 세계축구팬들의 반응은 뜨거웠다. └ 오!!! 진정한 최강팀들의 만남이네! 난 빨리 이 경기를 보고 싶어. 너무 재밌을 것 같아! 물론 바르셀로나가 4강에 올라와서 엘클라시코가 펼쳐졌으면 더 재밌었겠지만 말이야. └ 현재 4강에 올라온 팀은 아틀레티코 마드리드, 첼시, 레알 마드리드, 바이에른 뮌헨인데, 이중 어디가 우승할까? └ 당연히 레알 마드리드와 바이에른 뮌헨 중 승리한 팀이 우승하겠지! 축구팬들에게 이 네 팀 중에서 가장 강한 2개의 팀을 뽑으라고 하면 당연히 레알 마드리드와 바이에른 뮌헨을 뽑을 테니까. └ 과연 결승에 오르는 팀은 리그 29연승의 바이에른 뮌헨일까? 아니면 우주 최강 스쿼드의 레알 마드리드일까? └ 바이에른 뮌헨엔 신재욱이 있잖아. 걔 진짜 괴물이야. 그리고 이번 시즌의 바이에른 뮌헨은 정말 무적의 팀이라서 질 것 같지가 않아. └ 괴물은 레알 마드리드에 더 많아. └ 레알 마드리드는 어떤 팀이든 이길 수 있는 팀이지. 두 팀의 경기에 많은 관심을 보인 팬들의 의견은 둘로 나뉘었다. 레알 마드리드가 이길 것 같다는 의견과 바이에른 뮌헨이 이길 것 같다는 의견이었다. 두 의견은 치열하게 나뉘었다. 그런데 하나로 모인 의견도 존재했다. 바이에른 뮌헨과 레알 마드리드 중 한 팀이 우승하게 될 거라는 것. 이 의견엔 많은 수의 팬들이 동의했다. “재밌겠어.” 훈련을 마치고 숙소에 돌아온 신재욱은 레알 마드리드에 관련된 자료를 바라보며 웃었다. 레알 마드리드의 무시무시한 전력은 보면 볼수록 신재욱의 승부욕을 끌어 올려줬다. “크리스티아누 호날두, 카림 벤제마, 디 마리아, 베일, 루카 모드리치, 사비 알론소, 세르히오 라모스, 페페, 코엔트랑, 카르바할, 카시야스……하하! 멤버 정말 화려하네.” 레알 마드리드의 스쿼드는 명성에 걸맞았다. 현시점에서 최강의 멤버라고 해도 과언이 아니었다. 놀라운 건 주전선수가 아닌, 서브선수들의 이름값도 대단하다는 사실이었다. “바이에른 뮌헨 친구들이 걱정할 만했네.” 지금 신재욱은 동료들의 마음을 이해했다. 그러나 여전히 걱정은 되지 않았다. “못 이길 것 같진 않은데?” 오히려 레알 마드리드를 공부하면 할수록 이길 수 있겠다는 생각이 더욱 강해졌다. 며칠 뒤. 바이에른 뮌헨 내부의 분위기는 어느 때보다도 긴장감이 맴돌았다. 훈련장의 분위기는 특히 심했다. ‘다들 엄청 집중하고 있네. 그만큼 부담되는 경기라는 거겠지.’ 신재욱은 땀을 흘리며 훈련하는 동료들의 모습을 바라봤다. 이어서 감독을 바라봤다. 과르디올라 감독. 세계 최고의 감독 중 하나인 그는 경기장을 바쁘게 돌아다니며 선수들의 움직임과 전술을 확인하고 있었다. ‘감독님도 긴장하신 것 같고.’ 이처럼 주변을 바라보던 신재욱은 다시 훈련에 집중했다. 긴장하지는 않았지만, 늘 훈련엔 그 누구보다도 열심히 참여했다. ‘좋은 결과가 나왔으면 좋겠군.’ 3일 뒤, 마침내 신재욱을 포함한 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 레알 마드리드와의 경기를 위해 비행기에 올랐다. 스페인행 비행기였다. * * * 「바이에른 뮌헨 선수단, 스페인 도착! 레알 마드리드의 홈에서 어떤 경기 보여줄까?」 레알 마드리드의 홈구장 산티아고 베르나베우. 그곳의 분위기는 살벌했다. 레알 마드리드의 홈팬들은 바이에른 뮌헨 선수단을 위협적으로 노려보는 건 물론이고, 각종 협박성 메시지를 보내왔다. 우우우우우우! 거친 야유가 쏟아졌다. 전부 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들을 향한 것이었다. ― 어우! 야유가 심한데요? 레알 마드리드의 팬들이 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들에게 강력한 야유를 보내고 있습니다! ― 열정적인 것으로 유명한 레알 마드리드의 팬들답네요! 이러면 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들로서는 신경이 쓰일 수밖에 없죠! ― 오늘 바이에른 뮌헨은 레알 마드리드 홈구장에서 받는 압박을 잘 이겨내야만 승리할 수 있을 겁니다. 게다가 레알 마드리드는 홈에서 매우 강한 팀이거든요? ― 그렇습니다. 이번 시즌의 레알 마드리드는 홈구장에서만큼은 패배가 거의 없습니다. 상대의 홈구장. 그것도 레알 마드리드의 홈구장 산티아고 베르나베우가 주는 압박감은 대단했다. 그런데 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 별로 흔들리지 않고 있었다. 정신적으로 무장이 된 모습을 보였다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 레알 마드리드 팬들의 야유를 신경 쓰지 않는 것처럼 보이는데요? ― 의지를 잘 다지고 온 것 같습니다. 그리고 바이에른 뮌헨도 지난 시즌부터 엄청난 기세를 보여주고 있는 팀이니까요. 상대가 레알 마드리드라고 해도 이길 수 있다는 생각을 하고 있을 것 같습니다. 그 모습을 보며, 신재욱이 진한 미소를 지었다. ‘좋아. 다들 이길 준비가 됐구나.’ 동료들이 정신적으로 준비가 된 모습을 보는 건 뿌듯한 일이었다. 든든함도 느껴졌다. 이 정도 동료들과 함께라면 어떤 팀도 이길 수 있다는 생각이었다. 물론 신재욱 본인의 실력에도 자신이 있었다. ‘환생 전의 전성기 때만큼은 아니지만, 그래도 실력을 많이 되찾았어.’ 대부분의 능력이 90을 바라보고 있고, 슈팅 능력치는 90이었다. 각종 특성의 효과도 큰 도움을 주고 있었다. 때문에, 현재의 신재욱은 머릿속에 있는 움직임을 실제로도 비슷하게 구현할 수 있게 됐다. 그래서 더욱 자신감을 가질 수 있던 것이다. ― 양 팀 선수들이 악수를 나누고 있습니다. 서로를 바라보는 선수들의 얼굴에서 비장함이 느껴지네요! 신재욱은 미소를 지은 채, 상대 선수들과 악수를 나눴다. 크리스티아누 호날두, 카림 벤제마, 모드리치, 가레스 베일, 세르히오 라모스 등 유명한 선수들과의 악수. 그러나 별다른 감흥은 없었다. 환생 전엔 많이 봤던 선수들이었으니까. 특별한 반응을 보이는 건 오히려 레알 마드리드의 선수들이었다. ‘되게 쳐다보네.’ 이미 악수를 끝냈음에도 레알 마드리드 선수들의 시선은 신재욱에게서 떨어지지 않았다. 레알 마드리드 선수들 모두 신재욱이라는 신성을 경계하고 있었다. ― 하하! 신기한데요? 레알 마드리드 선수들이 신재욱 선수를 굉장히 신경 쓰는 것처럼 보이네요! 이에 한국축구팬들은 놀랍다는 반응과 재밌다는 반응을 동시에 드러냈다. └ ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ 레알 마드리드 선수들이 신재욱만 쳐다보는 거 봤어? 워;;;;;; └ 다들 신재욱을 인정하나 봐. 엄청 경계하는 게 여기까지 느껴져ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 경계하겠지. 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커고, 오늘 지들한테 골 넣을 선수니까. └ 근데 소름 돋긴 한다. 레알 마드리드 선수들이 죄다 신재욱만 보고 있어. 이 정도면 거의 연예인 팬미팅 느낌 아니냐? └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ레알 마드리드가 신재욱 노리고 있다니까 나중엔 동료로 뛰게 될 수도 있어ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 크리스타이누 호날두 표정 본 사람?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 신경 안 쓰는 척하면서 곁눈질로 신재욱 오지게 쳐다봄ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 호날두 개웃기네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 카림 벤제마는 시선을 못 떼는데? 같은 스트라이커라서 신재욱한테 더 호감을 느끼는 건가? 팬들이 알아볼 정도로 심하게 신재욱을 경계하던 레알 마드리드 선수들. 이들의 경계는 경기가 시작된 이후에도 이어졌다. ― 신재욱 선수에 대한 견제가 엄청나네요! 레알 마드리드 선수들이 오늘 신재욱 선수를 철저하게 막을 생각인 것 같습니다! ― 레알 마드리드는 신재욱 선수가 바이에른 뮌헨 공격의 핵심이라고 판단한 모양입니다! 신재욱을 향한 견제는 대단했다. 특히 루카 모드리치와 사비 알론소, 페페는 신재욱이 공을 잡기만 하면 반칙을 해서라도 끊어내려고 했다. ― 아! 신재욱 선수가 넘어집니다! 신재욱 선수를 향한 견제가 너무 심한데요? 신재욱 선수의 옷이 벌써 더러워졌습니다. ― 레알 마드리드 선수들은 카드를 조심할 필요가 있습니다. 지금까진 구두 경고로 끝났지만, 이젠 카드가 나올 수 있거든요? 신재욱은 상대의 반칙성 플레이를 굳이 버티지 않았다. 반칙이 들어오면 힘을 빼고 넘어져 버렸다. ‘쟤들 너무 과해. 후반전까지 생각하면 흥분을 가라앉힐 필요가 있을 텐데.’ 그에겐 느껴졌다. 레알 마드리드 선수들이 흥분하고 있다는 걸. 그러나 굳이 말해줄 생각은 없었다. 상대의 약점이 될 부분을 알려줄 필요는 없으니까. ‘생각보다 실망스러운데?’ 옷에 묻은 흙과 잔디를 털어내며, 신재욱은 쓴웃음을 지었다. 레알 마드리드라면 이것보다 더 좋은 경기력을 보여줄 것이라는 기대감이 있었는데, 막상 뚜껑을 열어보니 기대 이하였다. ‘다들 긴장해서 그런 거겠지?’ 자신에게만 너무 많은 견제가 들어왔다. 다르게 말하면 다른 곳에선 빈틈이 생기고 있다는 것이기도 했다. 그래서 신재욱은 플레이 스타일을 수정했다. 얄미울 정도로 레알 마드리드의 집중견제에 맞춘 플레이를 펼치기 시작했다. ― 신재욱 선수가 공을 절대 끌지 않네요! 공을 받으면 원터치 패스로 다시 넘겨주고 있습니다. ― 굉장히 영리하네요! 지금 레알 마드리드 선수들을 보면 신재욱 선수를 집중적으로 견제하고 있거든요? 그런데 지금처럼 신재욱 선수가 공을 길게 소유하지 않으면, 이 선수들이 할 게 없어집니다! ― 그리고 다른 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 편하게 경기할 수 있게 되죠! 지금도 그랬다. 수비형 미드필더로 출전한 동료 필립 람이 낮고 강하게 보내준 공을. 신재욱은 원터치 패스로 돌려놨다. 측면으로 달리던 프랑크 리베리의 앞에 뚝 떨어지는 정확한 패스였다. ― 오오! 바이에른 뮌헨! 좋은 기회입니다! 레알 마드리드의 측면 수비는 신재욱의 패스 한방에 뚫려버렸다. 돌아 뛰는 프랑크 리베리의 움직임을 순간적으로 놓쳤기에 나온 상황이었다. 이렇게 측면을 뚫린 상황에서도 레알 마드리드의 수비진은 신재욱에 대한 경계를 풀지 못했다. 신재욱이 레알 마드리드의 페널티박스 안으로 침투하고 있었으니까. 그 움직임이 너무나도 위협적이었으니까. 그때였다. “프랑크!” 신재욱은 한쪽 손을 높이 들며 프랑크 리베리의 이름을 불렀다. 미리 약속된, 속임수가 듬뿍 섞인 신호였다.","output":"173 --- 29 consecutive league wins! Advancing to the Champions League semi-finals! Accomplishing such great feats inevitably breeds confidence. That's how the Bayern Munich players felt. They had the confidence that they could beat any team they faced. But now, that wasn't the case. Worry was evident on the faces of the Bayern Munich players. \\"Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich, they meet in the Champions League semi-finals!\\" The Champions League semi-final draw resulted in a match against Real Madrid. Real Madrid, one of the world's top teams. Especially in terms of player value, they were considered the best in the world. Even for Bayern Munich's players, it was an opponent that could not help but make them nervous. An opponent whose victory could not be assured. But Shin Jaewook's reaction was different. Unlike the other players, he was smiling. \\"Real Madrid, that's great!\\" He wasn't just smiling; he was genuinely happy. \\"Beating a team of this caliber would be a tonic.\\" Because winning the match would be a great help for growth. \\"I was already in a good mood because of the team's recent performance.\\" Seeing Shin Jaewook smiling and happy, his teammates showed a bewildered reaction. \\"Jaewook, are you happy even though we're facing Real Madrid? Aren't you nervous at all?\\" \\"Wow... He's not nervous this time either?\\" \\"Hehe! How can Shin Jaewook be like that? He seems to be in a good mood even though we're meeting Real Madrid.\\" \\"Jaewook is always like that. But I still can't get used to that attitude.\\" The only one who seemed accustomed to it was Lee Taekhyun. \\"Why is everyone like this? You knew he was always like that, right? Shin Jaewook doesn't care whether it's Real Madrid or Barcelona. He thinks he can beat them all.\\" At the same time. The reaction of soccer fans around the world to the news that Real Madrid and Bayern Munich would meet in the Champions League semi-finals was heated. └ Oh!!! A true meeting of the strongest teams! I can't wait to see this match. It's going to be so exciting! Of course, it would have been even more exciting if Barcelona had made it to the semi-finals for an El Clasico. └ The teams that have made it to the semi-finals are Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich, but which one will win? └ Obviously, the team that wins between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich will be the champion! If you ask soccer fans to pick the two strongest teams out of these four, they would naturally choose Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. └ Will it be Bayern Munich, with their 29 consecutive league wins, or Real Madrid, with their universe's strongest squad, that makes it to the final? └ Bayern Munich has Shin Jaewook. He's a real monster. And this season's Bayern Munich seems invincible; it doesn't look like they can lose. └ There are more monsters in Real Madrid. └ Real Madrid is a team that can beat anyone. Fans who showed great interest in the match between the two teams were divided in their opinions. Some thought Real Madrid would win, while others believed Bayern Munich would. The opinions were fiercely divided. But there was one opinion that united everyone. That one of the two teams, either Bayern Munich or Real Madrid, would become the champion. Many fans agreed with this opinion. \\"It's going to be fun.\\" After finishing training and returning to the accommodation, Shin Jaewook looked at the materials related to Real Madrid and smiled. The more he looked at Real Madrid's formidable strength, the more it fueled his competitive spirit. \\"Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Di Maria, Bale, Luka Modric, Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Coentrao, Carvajal, Casillas... Haha! What a glamorous lineup.\\" Real Madrid's squad lived up to its reputation. It wasn't an exaggeration to call them the strongest members at the moment. What was surprising was not just the value of the starting players, but also the impressive names among the substitutes. \\"No wonder the Bayern Munich guys were worried.\\" Now, Shin Jaewook understood his teammates' feelings. However, he still wasn't worried. \\"It doesn't seem like we can't win?\\" Rather, the more he studied Real Madrid, the stronger his belief grew that they could be beaten. A few days later. The atmosphere inside Bayern Munich was more tense than ever. The atmosphere at the training ground was particularly intense. \\"Everyone is really focused. It must be because the match is so stressful.\\" Shin Jaewook watched his teammates sweating and training. Then he looked at the coach. Josep Guardiola. One of the world's top coaches, he was busily moving around the field, checking the players' movements and tactics. \\"It seems the coach is also nervous.\\" While observing his surroundings, Shin Jaewook refocused on training. Although he wasn't nervous, he always participated in training more diligently than anyone else. \\"I hope we get good results.\\" Three days later, Shin Jaewook and the Bayern Munich players finally boarded a plane for the match against Real Madrid. It was a flight to Spain. --- \\"Bayern Munich squad arrives in Spain! What kind of game will they show at Real Madrid's home?\\" Real Madrid's home stadium, Santiago Bernabeu. The atmosphere there was intense. Real Madrid's home fans not only glared threateningly at the Bayern Munich squad but also sent various intimidating messages. Boooooo! A rough chorus of boos poured out. All directed at the Bayern Munich players. ― Wow! The booing is intense, isn't it? Real Madrid's fans are sending strong boos to the Bayern Munich players! ― It's typical of the passionate Real Madrid fans! This will inevitably make the Bayern Munich players nervous! ― Today, Bayern Munich will have to withstand the pressure they receive at Real Madrid's home stadium to win. Plus, Real Madrid is a very strong team at home, right? ― That's right. This season's Real Madrid has hardly lost at their home stadium. The opponent's home stadium. Especially the pressure from Real Madrid's home stadium, Santiago Bernabeu, was tremendous. But the Bayern Munich players were not shaken. They showed a mentally armed appearance. ― It seems like the Bayern Munich players are not bothered by the boos from Real Madrid fans? ― They seem to have steeled their will well. And Bayern Munich has been showing tremendous momentum since last season. Even against Real Madrid, they seem to think they can win. Seeing this, Shin Jaewook smiled deeply. \\"Good. Everyone is ready to win.\\" It was gratifying to see his teammates mentally prepared. He also felt reassured. With teammates like these, he thought they could beat any team. Of course, Shin Jaewook was also confident in his own skills. \\"It's not quite like my peak before reincarnation, but I've regained a lot of my skills.\\" Most of his abilities were approaching 90, and his shooting ability was 90. The effects of various traits were also a great help. Therefore, the current Shin Jaewook could implement the movements in his head into reality. That's why he could be more confident. ― The players from both teams are shaking hands. You can feel the determination on the faces of the players looking at each other! Shin Jaewook shook hands with the opposing players with a smile. Handshakes with famous players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Modric, Gareth Bale, Sergio Ramos. However, there was no particular emotion. He had seen these players a lot before reincarnation. It was rather the Real Madrid players who showed a special reaction. \\"They're really looking.\\" Even after the handshake was over, the gaze of the Real Madrid players did not leave Shin Jaewook. All the Real Madrid players were wary of the prodigy Shin Jaewook. ― Haha! Isn't it curious? It seems like Real Madrid players are very concerned about Shin Jaewook! Korean soccer fans expressed their surprise and amusement at this. └ ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ Did you see Real Madrid players only looking at Shin Jaewook? Wow;;;;;; └ It seems they all recognize Shin Jaewook. They're so wary that I can feel it from hereㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Of course, they'd be wary. He's the best striker in the Bundesliga, and he's going to score against them today. └ But it's chilling. All Real Madrid players are only looking at Shin Jaewook. Isn't this almost like a celebrity fan meeting? └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Real Madrid is targeting Shin Jaewook, maybe they'll end up playing together laterㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Did anyone see Cristiano Ronaldo's expression?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He pretends not to care but keeps glancing at Shin Jaewookㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Ronaldo is hilariousㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Karim Benzema can't take his eyes off him? Is it because he's a fellow striker that he feels more affection for Shin Jaewook? Real Madrid players, who were so obviously wary of Shin Jaewook that even the fans noticed. Their wariness continued even after the game started. ― The marking on Shin Jaewook is intense! It seems like Real Madrid players are determined to block Shin Jaewook thoroughly today! ― Real Madrid seems to have judged that Shin Jaewook is the core of Bayern Munich's attack! The marking on Shin Jaewook was formidable. Especially Luka Modric, Xabi Alonso, and Pepe tried to interrupt him with fouls whenever he got the ball. ― Ah! Shin Jaewook goes down! The marking on Shin Jaewook is too harsh, isn't it? His clothes are already dirty. ― Real Madrid players need to be careful about cards. So far, they've only been given verbal warnings, but now cards could come out. Shin Jaewook didn't bother to resist the opponent's foul play. When a foul came in, he let go of his strength and fell. \\"They're too much. If they're thinking about the second half, they need to calm down.\\" He could feel it. The Real Madrid players were excited. But he had no intention of telling them. There was no need to point out a weakness that could be exploited by the opponent. \\"It's more disappointing than I thought.\\" Brushing off the dirt and grass on his clothes, Shin Jaewook gave a bitter smile. He had expected Real Madrid to show better gameplay than this, but it was below expectations once the lid was opened. \\"Are they all nervous because of that?\\" Too much marking was directed at him. In other words, it also meant that there were gaps elsewhere. So Shin Jaewook adjusted his playing style. He started playing in a way that was annoyingly tailored to Real Madrid's intense marking. ― Shin Jaewook doesn't hold onto the ball at all! As soon as he receives it, he passes it back with a one-touch pass. ― Very smart! If you look at Real Madrid players now, they are focusing on marking Shin Jaewook. But if Shin Jaewook doesn't keep the ball for long like now, these players will have nothing to do! ― And it allows the other Bayern Munich players to play comfortably! It was the same now. The ball sent low and hard by his teammate, defensive midfielder Philipp Lahm. Shin Jaewook returned it with a one-touch pass. A precise pass that dropped right in front of the sprinting Franck Ribery on the side. ― Oh! Bayern Munich! This is a good opportunity! Real Madrid's side defense was breached with just one pass from Shin Jaewook. The situation arose because they momentarily missed the movement of the turning Franck Ribery. Even in this situation where the side was breached, Real Madrid's defense could not let go of their guard against Shin Jaewook. Shin Jaewook was infiltrating Real Madrid's penalty box. His movement was too threatening. That's when it happened. \\"Franck!\\" Shin Jaewook raised one hand high and called Franck Ribery's name. It was a pre-arranged signal, full of deception."},{"instruction":"175 * * * 이택현이 슈팅한 순간. 신재욱은 예상했다. ‘막힐 수도 있겠는데?’ 세계 최고의 골키퍼 중 하나인 이케르 카시야스라면 막아낼지도 모르겠다고. 아주 잘 때린 슈팅이라면 모르겠지만. ‘너무 뻔한 슈팅이야.’ 이택현의 슈팅엔 아쉬움이 있었다. 세계적인 수준의 골키퍼라면 충분히 읽을 수 있을 정도로 무난한 슈팅이었으니까. 그래서 신재욱이 움직였다. ‘카시야스의 위치상 저 슈팅을 잡아내는 건 무리야. 막긴 막을 것 같은데, 손끝에 걸리겠지.’ 이케르 카시야스의 손끝에 걸릴 공의 위치를 예상하며 발을 뻗었다. 반쯤은 도박이었다. 자칫 쓸데없는 행동이 될 수도 있다. 그러나 만약 아무런 결과를 내지 못한다고 해도 괜찮았다. ‘안 되면 어쩔 수 없는 거지 뭐.’ 도전하는 것만으로도 의미가 있다고 생각했으니까. ― 어어? 어?! ― 오오! 해설들이 깜짝 놀랐다. 경기를 지켜보던 관중들도 눈을 부릅뜨며 비명을 질렀다. 전혀 예상치 못한 신재욱의 움직임 때문이었다. 그리고 지금. 신재욱은 발을 뻗으며 미소를 지었다. ‘된 것 같은데?’ 예상했던 그대로의 상황이 나왔다. 아주 조금의 오차는 있지만, 충분히 컨트롤할 수 있는 정도였다. 스윽! 신재욱이 발끝을 움직였다. 이케르 카시야스의 손끝에 걸리며 튕겨 나오려는 공을 다시 골대 안으로 밀어 넣었다. 퉁! 투웅! 공은 바닥에 두 번 튕기며 레알 마드리드의 골대 안으로 들어갔다. ― 우와아아아아아아! 고오오오오오올! 골입니다! 들어갔습니다! 이게 뭔가요?! 이런 골이 나오네요! ― 우오오오오! 신재욱 선수! 믿을 수 없는 골입니다! 이케르 카시야스의 슈퍼세이브라는 말을 외치려던 때, 신재욱 선수가 그걸 또 골로 연결하네요! 이건 뭐죠? 무슨 움직임이죠? 카시야스 골키퍼의 움직임을 예상이라도 한 걸까요? ― 그… 게 아니라면 설명이 되질 않네요! 신재욱 선수가 이제는 미래를 내다보는 걸까요? 산티아고 베르나베우가 조용해졌다. 관중들 모두 충격을 받은 얼굴이었다. 실시간으로 경기를 지켜보던 전 세계 축구팬들의 반응도 비슷했다. └ ……내가 지금 뭘 본 거지? └ 오우…… 이건 말이 안 되는데……. └ 신재욱은 미래를 볼 수 있는 거야? 어떻게 이런 골을 만들어낼 수가 있지? └ 지금 이케르 카시야스가 막아낼 방향을 예측해서 발을 뻗은 거 맞지? 난 살면서 저렇게 골을 넣는 선수를 본 적이 없어. └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 스트라이커는 마법사야? 매번 하이라이트 영상만 보다가 경기하는 건 오늘 처음 봤는데, 움직임의 수준이 너무 높은데? └ 신재욱은 팬들을 자주 놀라게 하는 선수야. 근데 이번 골은 그중에서도 특별하네. 나 아직도 입이 안 닫혀. └ 이케르 카시야스가 가장 놀라고 있을걸? 저기 카시야스의 표정 좀 봐봐. 이게 현실인지 아닌지도 판단이 안 된다는 표정이잖아. └ 미래를 보는 선수가 있을 줄이야. 하하! 물론 말이 안 되지만, 신재욱이 방금 넣은 골은 미래를 본다고 해도 믿어질 정도였어! └ 난 늘 말하지만, 신재욱은 세계 최고의 스트라이커가 될 남자야. 모두 놀라움을 넘어 믿을 수 없다는 반응이었다. 경기장에 있던 선수들도 눈을 동그랗게 뜬 채, 신재욱을 바라봤다. 그리고 그런 시선이 쏟아지는 가운데. 신재욱은 공을 옆구리에 낀 채, 덤덤한 얼굴로 경기장 중앙을 향해 달렸다. ― 신재욱 선수가 평소처럼 경기장 중앙으로 공을 옮기고 있습니다! 이야…… 모두를 놀라게 한 골을 터트려놓고 이렇게나 덤덤할 수가 있나요? ― 허허……! 신재욱 선수에겐 그렇게 놀라운 일이 아닌 모양입니다. 산티아고 베르나베우의 분위기가 바뀐 것처럼. 양 팀 선수들의 기세도 바뀌었다. 레알 마드리드는 기세가 한풀 꺾인 게 겉으로 드러났고. 바이에른 뮌헨의 선수들은 더욱 기세가 올랐다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 점유율을 높여가고 있습니다! 2 대 0으로 앞서가는 상황이어서 그런지, 선수들의 움직임에서 여유가 느껴지네요. ― 전반전은 바이에른 뮌헨이 완전히 가져가는 분위기입니다. 반면 레알 마드리드 선수들은 신재욱 선수의 골 이후로 위축되어있는 듯한 모습을 보여주고 있네요. ― 정신적으로 큰 충격을 받았을 겁니다. 전반전 내내 과하다는 생각이 들 정도로 신재욱 선수를 경계했거든요? 그런데도 신재욱 선수에게 골을 허용했으니, 흔들리지 않을 수가 없죠. 레알 마드리드는 수비하는 것에 급급했다. 앞으로 나가며 빌드업의 중심이 되어주어야 할 루카 모드리치와 사비 알론소조차 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격을 막아내는 것에 바빴다. 최전방에 있는 크리스티아누 호날두가 답답하다는 듯 소리를 질러봤지만 크게 달라지는 건 없었다. 전반전의 시간이 흘러가는 내내, 바이에른 뮌헨의 분위기였다. ― 오오! 이케르 카시야스의 선방입니다! ― 신재욱 선수의 과감한 슈팅이었습니다! 굉장히 위협적이었는데, 이케르 카시야스 골키퍼가 이걸 막아내네요! ― 이번엔 알라바의 슈팅이었습니다! ― 다비드 알라바 선수도 수비수지만 킥 능력이 굉장히 좋은 선수거든요? 비록 골대를 살짝 벗어났지만, 충분히 슈팅을 시도할 수 있는 상황이었습니다. 좋은 시도였죠! 바이에른 뮌헨은 계속해서 레알 마드리드를 밀어붙였다. 가능하면 전반전에 추가 골을 넣어서 점수 차이를 더욱 벌리려고 했다. 그러나 레알 마드리드는 레알 마드리드였다. 멘탈이 흔들린 상황에서도 집중력을 잃지 않고 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격을 필사적으로 막아냈다. ― 전반전이 종료됩니다. 바이에른 뮌헨에게 좋은 기회가 많았는데, 레알 마드리드가 잘 막아내며 2 대 0에서 추가 실점은 없었습니다. ― 레알 마드리드 선수들의 투지도 대단하네요. 그런데 후반전엔 지금처럼 플레이하면 경기에서 이기는 건 어려울 것 같습니다. 후반전엔 뭔가 다른 모습을 보여줄 필요가 있어 보입니다. 잠시 후. 후반전이 시작됐다. 양 팀 선수들의 구성엔 변화가 없었다. 모두 전반전을 뛰었던 선수들이었다. 이처럼 선수들은 같았지만, 경기력엔 변화가 생긴 팀이 있었다. ― 레알 마드리드의 전술이 조금 바뀐 것 같죠? ― 예. 전반전보다 훨씬 더 공격적으로 바뀌었습니다. 효과도 괜찮은 것 같습니다. 지금 보시면 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 당황하고 있거든요? 공격에 많은 무게를 실은 레알 마드리드는 위협적이었다. 크리스티아누 호날두, 카림 벤제마, 가레스 베일이라는 공격진은 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비진을 긴장시켰다. ― 레알 마드리드 선수들이 전반전이 끝난 이후에 동기부여를 확실히 하고 온 것처럼 보입니다! 전반전과는 완전히 다른 팀이 되었거든요? ― 정말 그러네요! 전반전에 밀리던 레알 마드리드가 아닌 것 같습니다! 이제야 팬들이 원하던 레알 마드리드의 모습을 보여주고 있네요! 당황한 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 잠시 웅크렸다. 날카로운 레알 마드리드의 공격을 막아내기 위해서였다. 신재욱도 지금은 밑으로 내려와서 동료들의 수비를 도왔다. 스트라이커였지만, 그의 수비 가담은 팀에 큰 도움을 주고 있었다. 지금도 그랬다. 휘익! 휙! 탈압박 능력이 워낙 뛰어나서 어지간해선 공을 뺏기지 않는 선수인 루카 모드리치. 그는 공을 소유한 상태로 자신감 있게 전진했다. 토니 크로스가 가까이에 붙은 채로 압박을 하고 있었지만, 루카 모드리치는 너무나도 편안해 보였다. 그런데 이때. 루카 모드리치의 시야 밖에서 은밀하게 접근한 신재욱이 몸을 날렸다. 타이밍이 완벽한 슬라이딩 태클. 제아무리 루카 모드리치라고 해도 보이지 않는 곳에서 갑자기 들어온 태클을 피해내진 못했다. 더구나 신재욱은 공을 먼저 건드렸다. 반칙이 아닌, 정당한 태클이었다. ― 신재욱이 끊어냈습니다! 스트라이커면서 세계 최고 수준의 태클 능력을 지닌 선수다운 플레이입니다! ― 루카 모드리치 선수는 정말 공을 뺏기지 않는 걸로 유명한 선수인데, 신재욱 선수의 태클엔 어쩔 수가 없네요! 이러면 레알 마드리드의 공격 흐름이 완전히 끊겼죠! 신재욱이 몸을 벌떡 일으켰다. 그 순간에 공을 뺏긴 루카 모드리치가 덤벼들었지만, 신재욱은 몸을 빙글 돌리며 탈압박을 해냈다. ― 루카 모드리치를 탈압박해내는 신재욱! 직접 공을 몰고 앞으로 나아갑니다! 신재욱이 공을 끊어냈을 때부터. 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진은 앞으로 튀어 나가고 있었다. 미리 약속된 움직임이기도 했지만, 신재욱을 믿기에 나온 판단이었다. 신재욱이라면 공을 뺏기지 않고 어떻게든 전방으로 연결해줄 거라는 믿음. ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습입니다! 공을 몰고 전진하는 신재욱의 앞을 사비 알론소가 가로막으려고 했다. 이때 신재욱은 속도를 줄이지 않고 몸을 대각선으로 틀었다. 그러자 사비 알론소가 어깨를 부딪쳐왔다. 퍼억! 신재욱은 밀리지 않았다. 사비 알론소와 몸싸움을 하면서도 계속해서 앞으로 나아갔다. 그 순간 신재욱의 시야엔 보였다. 전방에서 공을 받을 준비가 된 이택현의 모습이. 투욱! 신재욱은 이택현을 향해 공을 강하게 차 냈다. 동시에 전방을 향해 전속력으로 달리며 소리쳤다. “다시!” 그 말을 들은 이택현이 오른발의 안쪽으로 공을 툭 밀었다. 달려오는 신재욱의 앞쪽 공간에 밀어준 센스있는 패스였다. ‘좋은 패스야.’ 신재욱은 공에 집중했다. 아주 좋은 슈팅 타이밍이었다. 순간적으로 이택현에게 시선이 쏠린 상황이었기에, 방해도 없었다. 퍼엉! 신재욱이 발등이 공을 때려냈다. 강하게 때리기보다는 제대로 맞추는 것에 집중한 슈팅이었다. 의도는 성공했다. 공은 발등에 제대로 걸렸고, 강하게 차려고 하지 않았음에도 엄청난 속도로 쏘아졌다. 페널티박스 바깥에서 때려낸 슈팅이었는데, 공은 순식간에 레알 마드리드의 골대 안을 파고들었다. 철렁! 그 대단한 이케르 카시야스 골키퍼조차 지금은 반응도 하지 못한 채 제자리에 서 있었다. ― 우와아아아아아! 들어갔습니다! 신재욱 선수의 원더골이 나왔습니다! 정말 환상적인 골이네요! ― 엄청난 슈팅이었습니다! 이케르 카시야스 골키퍼가 움직이지도 못할 정도로 강력한 슈팅이었죠! 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수의 호흡은 정말 경이롭습니다……! ― 신재욱 선수가 산티아고 베르나베우를 다시 한번 침묵하게 합니다! 그 열정적인 레알 마드리드의 팬들이 지금은 응원조차 하지 못하며 허탈해하고 있습니다! ― 양 팀의 스코어는 이제 3 대 0이 됩니다! 치열할 것이라던 전문가들의 예상과는 다르게 바이에른 뮌헨이 3점이나 앞서나갑니다! 해설들의 말처럼 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 침묵했다. 너무 강한 충격을 받은 것일까? 침묵은 공을 든 신재욱이 경기장 중앙에 도착할 때까지 끝나지 않았다. 그리고 신재욱은 덤덤했다. 레알 마드리드를 상대로 2개의 골을 넣었음에도 별것 아니라는 듯한 태도를 보였다. 그런데 지금. 신재욱의 입꼬리가 꿈틀거렸다. 표정에 변화가 생겼다. 골을 넣었기 때문은 아니었다. 허공에 떠오른 몇 개의 메시지 때문이었다. [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] [몸싸움이 1 올랐습니다!] [태클이 1 올랐습니다!] [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] [대인방어가 1 올랐습니다!] “이게 얼마 만이야?”","output":"175 --- The moment Lee Taekhyun took the shot, Shin Jaewook anticipated. \\"It might be blocked?\\" He thought that Iker Casillas, one of the world's best goalkeepers, might be able to save it. Unless it was a really well-struck shot. \\"The shot is too obvious.\\" There was a sense of disappointment in Lee Taekhyun's shot. It was a manageable shot for a world-class goalkeeper to read. That's why Shin Jaewook moved. \\"Given Casillas's position, catching that shot would be tough. He might block it, but it'll probably just graze his fingertips.\\" Anticipating the ball's position as it would be deflected by Iker Casillas's fingertips, Shin Jaewook stretched out his foot. It was half a gamble. It could turn out to be a pointless action. But even if it didn't lead to any result, it was okay. \\"If it doesn't work out, then it can't be helped.\\" He thought there was meaning in the attempt alone. ― Uh? Oh?! ― Wow! The commentators were taken aback. The spectators watching the game also widened their eyes and screamed. It was because of Shin Jaewook's unexpected movement. And now. Shin Jaewook extended his foot with a smile. \\"It seems to have worked?\\" The situation unfolded just as he had anticipated. There was a slight margin of error, but it was within a controllable range. Swoosh! Shin Jaewook moved his foot. He pushed the ball, which was about to bounce off Iker Casillas's fingertips, back into the goal. Thump! Thwump! The ball bounced twice on the ground and went into Real Madrid's goal. ― Wowwwww! Goooooal! It's a goal! What is this?! Such a goal has been scored! ― Wow! Shin Jaewook! An unbelievable goal! Just as we were about to shout about Iker Casillas's super save, Shin Jaewook turns it into a goal! What is this? What kind of movement is this? Did he anticipate Casillas's movement? ― If not... it doesn't make sense! Is Shin Jaewook now able to see the future? Santiago Bernabeu fell silent. The faces of all the spectators were in shock. The reaction of soccer fans around the world watching the game in real-time was similar. └ ...What did I just see? └ Wow... this is unbelievable... └ Can Shin Jaewook see the future? How can he score such a goal? └ Did he just predict the direction Iker Casillas would save and stretch out his foot? I've never seen a player score a goal like that in my life. └ Is Bayern Munich's striker a wizard? I've only ever seen highlight videos, but watching him play for the first time today, his movement is on such a high level? └ Shin Jaewook always surprises the fans. But this goal is special even among those. My mouth is still open. └ Iker Casillas must be the most surprised, right? Look at Casillas's face. He can't even tell if this is reality. └ To think there's a player who can see the future. Haha! Of course, it's impossible, but the goal Shin Jaewook just scored makes it believable! └ I always say it, but Shin Jaewook is the man who will become the world's best striker. The reactions were beyond surprise; they were disbelief. The players on the field also looked at Shin Jaewook with wide eyes. And amidst such gazes. Shin Jaewook, with the ball at his side, ran calmly towards the center of the field. ― Shin Jaewook is moving the ball to the center of the field as usual! Wow... How can he be so calm after scoring such a surprising goal? ― Hehe...! It seems like it's not such a surprising event for Shin Jaewook. As if the atmosphere at Santiago Bernabeu had changed. The momentum of the players from both teams changed as well. Real Madrid's momentum visibly waned. The Bayern Munich players were more fired up. ― Bayern Munich is increasing their possession! Maybe because they're leading 2-0, there's a sense of ease in the players' movements. ― The first half is completely dominated by Bayern Munich. On the other hand, Real Madrid players seem to be intimidated after Shin Jaewook's goal. ― They must have received a big mental shock. They were overly cautious of Shin Jaewook throughout the first half, right? But still, they conceded a goal to him, so they can't help but be shaken. Real Madrid was busy defending. Even Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso, who should have been central to the build-up, were busy blocking Bayern Munich's attacks. Cristiano Ronaldo, at the front, shouted as if frustrated, but nothing much changed. Throughout the first half, it was Bayern Munich's atmosphere. ― Oh! Iker Casillas's save! ― It was a bold shot from Shin Jaewook! It was very threatening, but goalkeeper Iker Casillas managed to save it! ― This time it was Alaba's shot! ― David Alaba is a defender, but he has a very good kicking ability, right? Although it slightly missed the goal, it was a situation where he could attempt a shot. It was a good try! Bayern Munich continued to push Real Madrid. They tried to score an additional goal in the first half to widen the score gap. But Real Madrid was still Real Madrid. Even with their mentality shaken, they did not lose focus and desperately blocked Bayern Munich's attacks. ― The first half ends. Bayern Munich had many good opportunities, but Real Madrid managed to block them well, keeping the score at 2-0 without conceding more. ― The fighting spirit of Real Madrid players is impressive. But if they play like this in the second half, it will be difficult to win the game. They need to show something different in the second half. Shortly after. The second half began. There were no changes in the composition of the players from both teams. They were all players who had played in the first half. While the players were the same, there was a team that had changed in performance. ― Real Madrid's tactics seem to have changed a bit, right? ― Yes. They've become much more offensive than in the first half. It seems to be working well. If you look now, Bayern Munich players are flustered, aren't they? Real Madrid, with a heavier emphasis on attack, was threatening. The attacking line of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and Gareth Bale put pressure on Bayern Munich's defense. ― Real Madrid players seem to have been highly motivated after the end of the first half! They've become a completely different team from the first half, right? ― Really! Real Madrid doesn't seem to be the team that was pushed back in the first half! Now they're showing the performance that the fans wanted to see! The flustered Bayern Munich players crouched for a moment. It was to block the sharp attacks of Real Madrid. Shin Jaewook also came down to help his teammates' defense. Although a striker, his involvement in defense was a great help to the team. It was the same now. Whisk! Whisk! Luka Modric, a player with such excellent dribbling skills that he hardly ever loses the ball. He advanced confidently with the ball. Toni Kroos was pressing him closely, but Luka Modric looked too comfortable. But then. Shin Jaewook, who had secretly approached from outside Modric's field of vision, threw himself into a sliding tackle. The timing was perfect. Even Luka Modric couldn't avoid a tackle that came suddenly from a blind spot. Moreover, Shin Jaewook touched the ball first. It was a legitimate tackle, not a foul. ― Shin Jaewook cuts it off! A play worthy of a striker with one of the world's best tackling abilities! ― Luka Modric is famous for not losing the ball, but he couldn't do anything about Shin Jaewook's tackle! This completely cuts off Real Madrid's attacking flow! Shin Jaewook got up briskly. At that moment, Luka Modric, who had lost the ball, lunged at him, but Shin Jaewook spun his body and escaped the pressure. ― Shin Jaewook escapes Luka Modric! He takes the ball forward himself! From the moment Shin Jaewook intercepted the ball. Bayern Munich's attackers had sprung forward. It was a pre-arranged movement, but it was also a decision made because they trusted Shin Jaewook. They believed that Shin Jaewook would not lose the ball and would somehow connect it to the front. ― It's a counterattack by Bayern Munich! As Shin Jaewook advanced with the ball, Xabi Alonso tried to block him. At that moment, Shin Jaewook didn't slow down but twisted his body diagonally. Then Xabi Alonso bumped into him with his shoulder. Thump! Shin Jaewook didn't budge. He continued to move forward while engaging in a physical contest with Xabi Alonso. At that moment, Shin Jaewook saw it. The figure of Lee Taekhyun, ready to receive the ball up front. Thwack! Shin Jaewook kicked the ball hard towards Lee Taekhyun. At the same time, he ran at full speed towards the front, shouting. \\"Again!\\" Hearing that, Lee Taekhyun nudged the ball with the inside of his right foot. It was a sensible pass that pushed the ball into the space ahead of the sprinting Shin Jaewook. \\"Good pass.\\" Shin Jaewook focused on the ball. It was a very good timing for a shot. Since the attention was momentarily on Lee Taekhyun, there was no interference. Bang! Shin Jaewook struck the ball with his instep. It was a shot focused on hitting the ball correctly rather than striking it hard. The intention was successful. The ball was hit properly by the instep, and even though he didn't try to hit it hard, it shot out at an incredible speed. It was a shot from outside the penalty box, but the ball quickly burrowed into Real Madrid's goal. Clang! Even the great Iker Casillas couldn't react and just stood there. ― Wowwwww! It's in! Shin Jaewook scores a wonder goal! What a fantastic goal! ― It was an incredible shot! It was so powerful that even goalkeeper Iker Casillas couldn't move! The coordination between Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun is truly astonishing...! ― Shin Jaewook silences Santiago Bernabeu once again! Those passionate Real Madrid fans are now too stunned to even cheer! ― The score for both teams is now 3-0! Contrary to the experts' predictions of a fierce match, Bayern Munich is now leading by three points! As the commentators said, Real Madrid's fans were silent. Was it too much of a shock? The silence didn't end until Shin Jaewook reached the center of the field with the ball. And Shin Jaewook was calm. Even after scoring two goals against Real Madrid, he acted as if it was nothing special. But now. The corners of Shin Jaewook's mouth twitched. There was a change in his expression. It wasn't because he had scored a goal. It was because of several messages that had appeared in the air. [Agility has increased by 1!] [Physical Confrontation has increased by 1!] [Tackling has increased by 1!] [Stamina has increased by 1!] [Man-to-Man Defense has increased by 1!] \\"How long has it been?\\""},{"instruction":"Genes and environmental factors in Multiple sclerosis","output":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS), which comprises the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is considered a multifactorial disease, meaning that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development. The exact cause of MS is not known, but it is widely believed to involve a combination of factors that lead to an aberrant immune response against the myelin sheath of neurons, causing inflammation and damage, which result in a range of neurological symptoms. **Genetic Factors:** Genetic susceptibility plays a significant role in MS. The risk of developing MS is higher in individuals with a family history of the disease, indicating a hereditary component. Studies have identified several genes associated with an increased risk of MS, with the strongest link being to genes within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, particularly the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele. HLAs are part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which plays an essential role in the immune system by presenting antigens to immune cells. However, having a genetic predisposition to MS does not mean a person will definitely develop the disease, as many people with these genetic markers never develop MS. This suggests that genetic factors increase susceptibility but may need to be triggered by environmental factors. **Environmental Factors:** A number of environmental factors have been associated with an increased risk of MS, including: 1. **Vitamin D deficiency:** Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to a higher risk of MS. Vitamin D, obtained from sunlight exposure and dietary sources, is thought to play a role in immune system regulation. 2. **Viral infections:** Exposure to certain viruses has been hypothesized to trigger MS in genetically susceptible individuals. One such virus is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the cause of infectious mononucleosis (also known as mono or \\"the kissing disease\\"). A past EBV infection is almost universal in individuals diagnosed with MS. 3. **Smoking:** Cigarette smoking has been shown to increase the risk of MS and can also lead to a more severe disease course. 4. **Geographical location:** There is a higher prevalence of MS in countries farther from the equator, which may relate to less sunlight exposure and lower vitamin D levels. 5. **Age and gender:** MS is more commonly diagnosed in young adults and is more prevalent in women than men. 6. **Obesity:** High body mass index (BMI) in childhood and adolescence has been associated with an increased risk of MS in later life. 7. **Other factors:** Other possible environmental factors include diet, occupational hazards, and exposure to various physical or chemical agents, although the roles of these factors are less clear and require further research. Gene-environment interactions are likely to be crucial in the development of MS. Understanding these complex interactions might provide insights into the mechanisms of MS and potentially lead to new prevention and treatment strategies. Early genetic profiling of individuals at higher risk, coupled with monitoring of environmental exposures, might enable better prediction and management of the disease in the future."},{"instruction":"Drugs used in MS treatment","output":"The treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) involves several classes of drugs aimed at managing the disease course, treating relapses, and managing symptoms. Here are some of the main types of drugs used in the treatment of MS: **Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs):** DMTs are the cornerstone of MS treatment and aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, slow the progression of the disease, and prevent new lesions from forming in the CNS. 1. **Interferon beta medications:** These include drugs like Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and Plegridy. They are designed to reduce inflammation and the occurrence of relapses. 2. **Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone):** This drug may block your immune system's attack on myelin and is used to treat relapsing forms of MS. 3. **Natalizumab (Tysabri):** This medication is considered to be highly effective and is generally used when other treatments have failed. It blocks the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from the bloodstream to the brain and spinal cord. 4. **Fingolimod (Gilenya), Siponimod (Mayzent), Ozanimod (Zeposia):** These are sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators that keep immune cells trapped in lymph nodes, thus preventing them from reaching the CNS and causing damage. 5. **Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity):** These drugs are thought to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. 6. **Teriflunomide (Aubagio):** It works by targeting the rapidly dividing cells in the immune system that contribute to the damaging inflammation in MS. 7. **Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada):** This is a monoclonal antibody that depletes certain white blood cells which are implicated in MS. It is generally used in individuals with very active forms of the disease. 8. **Cladribine (Mavenclad):** This is an oral drug that selectively reduces B and T lymphocytes and is used in highly active relapsing MS. 9. **Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus):** This is the first drug approved to treat both relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). It targets B cells that contribute to the MS disease process. **Treatment for MS Relapses:** Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are often used to reduce inflammation during an acute MS relapse. They can help speed up recovery from a relapse but do not have a long-term effect on the disease. **Symptomatic Treatments:** These drugs do not modify the disease course but are used to manage specific symptoms of MS: - Muscle relaxants (e.g., baclofen, tizanidine) can help with muscle spasticity. - Medications for fatigue, such as amantadine or modafinil. - Antidepressants for mood or behavior symptoms. - Medications for bladder and bowel control issues. - Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs for pain management. **Emerging Therapies:** Research in MS treatment is ongoing, and newer drugs and treatment modalities are constantly being developed and tested in clinical trials. It's important to note that each drug comes with its own potential side effects and risks. The choice of a specific DMT or symptomatic treatment is personalized and based on factors such as the type and severity of MS, the patient's lifestyle, side effect profile, and any comorbid conditions. Regular monitoring and communication with healthcare providers are essential to optimize the management of MS and adjust treatment as necessary."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

I'm a male 26 years old with mixed skin type","output":"Creating a skincare routine for mixed skin types—which typically means you have some areas of dry skin and some areas that are oily, commonly the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin)—requires products that balance hydration and oil control. Here's a basic routine you could follow: **Morning:** 1. **Cleanser**: Start with a gentle, sulfate-free cleanser to remove overnight buildup without stripping your skin. Look for a product labeled for combination or mixed skin types. 2. **Toner**: Apply a toner to help balance your skin’s pH and remove any last traces of dirt or oil. Consider an alcohol-free formula to avoid over-drying. 3. **Serum**: If you have specific skin concerns like acne scars or uneven skin tone, you can use a targeted treatment serum. Serums with niacinamide can be especially beneficial for mixed skin as they can help regulate oil and improve skin barrier function. 4. **Moisturizer**: Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to hydrate without adding excess oil. Look for \\"non-comedogenic\\" on the label. 5. **Sunscreen**: Protect your skin with a broad-spectrum sunscreen of at least SPF 30. There are sunscreens formulated for mixed skin types that won't leave your skin feeling greasy. **Evening:** 1. **Cleanser**: Wash your face with the same gentle cleanser to remove the day's dirt, oil, and any sunscreen or products. 2. **Exfoliation**: Two or three times a week, use a gentle exfoliant to remove dead skin cells and improve skin texture. Chemical exfoliants with AHAs or BHAs are often preferred over physical scrubs because they're less likely to irritate the skin. 3. **Toner**: Apply your toner again to ensure your skin is prepped and balanced before applying other treatments. 4. **Treatment**: If you have a treatment product like a retinol serum or a targeted acne treatment, apply it in the evening to work overnight. Make sure to introduce retinol slowly into your routine and use it according to product instructions to avoid irritation. 5. **Moisturizer**: Nighttime is a good opportunity to use a slightly heavier moisturizer, especially around dry areas, to help your skin repair itself overnight. **Weekly:** - **Face Masks**: Once a week, you might consider using a mask tailored to mixed skin types, such as clay masks in the T-zone and hydrating masks on dryer areas. **General Tips:** - Always patch-test new products to ensure you don’t have an adverse reaction. - Drink plenty of water and maintain a balanced diet. - Get enough sleep and try to manage stress as these can impact your skin's health. - Avoid touching your face too much to reduce the transfer of oils and bacteria. - Change pillowcases and face towels regularly. Remember that a consistent routine is key to seeing improvements in your skin's health. Be patient, as it can take several weeks to notice changes, and be prepared to adjust your routine as needed based on how your skin responds or if your skin type changes due to seasons or other factors. If you have persistent skin concerns, consider consulting with a dermatologist for personalized advice."},{"instruction":"Write a routine for gym exercise","output":"Creating an effective gym exercise routine involves covering various aspects of fitness, including strength training, cardiovascular exercise, flexibility, and rest.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Переведи дословно на китайский и объясни: И почему-то не забудется та весенняя светлость.","output":"Дословный перевод фразы \\"И почему-то не забудется та весенняя светлость\\" на китайский язык выглядит следующим образом: \\"而且不知为何, 那春天的明亮不会被忘记。\\" - 而且 (érqiě) - и, к тому же; - 不知为何 (bù zhī wèihé) - почему-то; - 那 (nà) - та; - 春天 (chūntiān) - весенняя; - 的 (de) - генитивный показатель/прилагательное-постпозитив; - 明亮 (míngliàng) - светлость, яркость; - 不会 (bù huì) - не будет; - 被 (bèi) - показатель страдательного залога; - 忘记 (wàngjì) - забыть. Объяснение: В данном случае, перевод сохраняет смысл оригинальной фразы, говоря о том, что какая-то яркая и светлая атмосфера весны оставила такое впечатление, что, по каким-то причинам, её невозможно забыть. В китайском языке при передаче таких эмоционально окрашенных фраз часто используются слова и выражения, которые описывают чувства или впечатления несколько косвенно, оставляя место для интерпретации и личных ощущений."},{"instruction":"Дословно переведи на китайский: Неужели прошла моя алая молодость,","output":"Дословный перевод фразы \\"Неужели прошла моя алая молодость\\" на китайский язык будет следующим: 难道我的绯红青春已经过去了吗？ - 难道 (nándào) - неужели, разве; - 我的 (wǒ de) - моя; - 绯红 (fēihóng) - алая; - 青春 (qīngchūn) - молодость; - 已经 (yǐjīng) - уже; - 过去了 (guòqùle) - прошла; - 吗？(ma) - вопросительная частица, придающая предложению вопросительный оттенок. В китайском языке для вопросительных предложений часто используется вопросительная частица \\"吗\\" в конце предложения. Слово \\"绯红\\" (fēihóng) означает ярко-красный или алый цвет и используется здесь для передачи характера молодости, а \\"青春\\" (qīngchūn) обозначает \\"молодость\\"."},{"instruction":"Тут не вопрос.","output":"Извините за недоразумение. Если фраза не является вопросом, то вопросительную частицу \\"吗\\" следует убрать. Дословный перевод без вопросительной интонации будет выглядеть следующим образом: 我的绯红青春已经过去了。 - 我的 (wǒ de) - моя; - 绯红 (fēihóng) - алая; - 青春 (qīngchūn) - молодость; - 已经 (yǐjīng) - уже; - 过去了 (guòqùle) - прошла."},{"instruction":"А где слово \\"неужели\\"","output":"Прошу прощения за недочет. Если вы хотите передать оттенок удивления, но при этом составить не вопросительное предложение, можете использовать выражение \\"难道\\" (\\"нэндао\\") для передачи значения \\"неужели\\" в утвердительном контексте. Таким образом, перевод фразы на китайский язык будет: 难道我的绯红青春已经过去了。 - 难道 (nándào) - выражает сомнение или удивление, \\"неужели\\"; - 我的 (wǒ de) - моя; - 绯红 (fēihóng) - алая; - 青春 (qīngchūn) - молодость; - 已经 (yǐjīng) - уже; - 过去了 (guòqù le) - прошла. Такой перевод сохраняет значение удивления или недоумения, которое вы хотели передать."},{"instruction":"В чём разница \\"难道我的绯红青春已经过去了\\" и \\"难道我的绯红青春已经过去\\"","output":"Обе фразы на китайском языке передают идею удивления или сомнения относительно того, что алая молодость уже прошла. Однако имеется маленькая нюансировка в использовании глагола \\"过去\\" в разных временных формах. 1. 难道我的绯红青春已经过去了。 (Nándào wǒ de fēihóng qīngchūn yǐjīng guòqùle.) 2. 难道我的绯红青春已经过去。 (Nándào wǒ de fēihóng qīngchūn yǐjīng guòqù.) В первой фразе \\"过去了\\" (guòqùle) включает аспектную частицу \\"了\\" (le), которая указывает, что действие (в данном случае, процесс прохождения молодости) уже завершилось. Так, \\"了\\" добавляет значимость к завершенности события. Во второй фразе использование \\"过去\\" (guòqù) без частицы \\"了\\" также означает, что молодость уже прошла, но часть, указывающая на завершенность события, не выражена явно, фокусируясь скорее на самом факте прохождения, без дополнительного акцента на завершённость этого процесса. В повседневном китайском языке обе формы могут использоваться довольно свободно, и разница между ними невелика. Но в определённых контекстах добавление или опущение \\"了\\" может несколько изменять оттенок значения."},{"instruction":"Переведи на монгольский дословно повествовательную фразу: Неужели прошла моя алая молодость.","output":"Повествовательная фраза \\"Неужели прошла моя алая молодость\\" на монгольском языке будет выглядеть следующим образом: Миний улаан залуучууд минь өнгөрсөн үү?"},{"instruction":"Переведи на монгольский дословно повествовательную не вопросительную фразу и поясни каждое слово: Неужели прошла моя алая молодость.","output":"Дословный перевод фразы \\"Неужели прошла моя алая молодость\\" на монгольский язык: \\"Би миний улаан залуу нас чам дээр гарсан уу.\\" Разберем пояснение каждого слова: - Би (би) - \\"я\\", первое лицо единственного числа. - Миний (миний) - притяжательное местоимение \\"мой\\". - Улаан (улаан) - прилагательное \\"ала́я\\", означает красный или яркий. - Залуу нас (залуу нас) - существительное в единственном числе \\"молодость\\". Залуу означает молодой(ая), нас - возраст или жизнь. - Чам (чам) - предлог, обычно означающий \\"над, наверху, на\\", в данном контексте может обозначать что-то прошедшее или превышенное. - Дээр (дээр) - существительное или частица, в зависимости от контекста, означает \\"выше\\" или \\"над\\", часто используется для указания местоположения как в пространстве, так и в метафорическом смысле. В данном контексте может усиливать значение предлога чам в плане превышения или прошедшего. - Гарсан (гарсан) - прошедшее время глагола \\"гарах\\", означающего \\"проходить, выходить\\". В этом случае - прошедший. Пожалуйста, обратите внимание, что монгольский язык обладает собственными грамматическими особенностями и структурой предложения, поэтому прямой дословный перевод может не полностью отражать естественный монгольский язык."},{"instruction":"Не красный, а алый","output":"Алый цвет на монгольском будет \\"улаан\\" - это более близкое к тому оттенку красного, который можно описать как алый. В монгольском языке нет строгого разделения на алый и красный, как в русском, и слово \\"улаан\\" может использоваться для обозначения оба этих оттенков. Таким образом, слово \\"улаан\\" в данной фразе уже употребляется как можно более адекватно."},{"instruction":"А как же \\"час улаан\\"?","output":"Вы правы, в монгольском существует выражение \\"цахиур улаан\\" (цахиур цагаан), которое буквально переводится как \\"кроваво-красный\\" или \\"алый\\", и оно может использоваться для описания оттенков красного цвета, напоминающих кровь или более яркие и насыщенные. Однако это сочетание чаще всего используется для описания выраженного алого цвета. Таким образом, если ваша цель - подчеркнуть именно алый оттенок, а не просто красный, фраза на монгольском может быть переведена следующим образом: \\"Чи минь цахиур улаан залуу нас чам дээр өнгөрч байна уу?\\" Пояснение каждого слова: - Чи (чи) - \\"ты\\", второе лицо единственного числа, используется здесь вместо \\"моя\\" для соответствия повествовательной структуре фразы. - Минь - форма притяжательного местоимения \\"мой\\", употребляемая вместе с \\"чи\\". - Цахиур улаан (цахиур улаан) - \\"алый\\", составлено из двух слов: \\"цахиур\\" означает кровь, \\"улаан\\" - красный. - Залуу нас (залуу нас) - \\"молодость\\", \\"залуу\\" - \\"молодой, зеленый\\", \\"нас\\" - \\"возраст\\". - Чам дээр (чам дээр) - фразеологическое сочетание используется для обозначения прошедших обстоятельств или пережитого опыта. - Өнгөрч байна уу (өнгөрч байна уу) - \\"прошла\\", \\"өнгөрч\\" - прошедшая форма глагола \\"өнгөр\\" (проходить), \\"байна\\" означает состояние, а \\"уу\\" - вопросительная частица, которая в данном случае используется для выражения недоумения или сомнения, в данном контексте соответствует русскому \\"неужели\\"."},{"instruction":"سلام","output":"سلام! چطور می‌توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ اگر سوال یا موضوعی دارید که درباره‌ی آن صحبت کنیم، لطفاً بپرسید."},{"instruction":"برای اینکه بخوام تغییرات اساسی توی این کد اعمال کنی کدوم بخش از کد های js و css رو میخوای <!DOCTYPE html> <html data-bs-theme=\\"light\\" lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\\"> <title>Card Image Top</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"assets/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css\\"> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"assets/css/Header-1.css\\"> </head> <body> <div class=\\"card\\" style=\\"width: 18rem;\\"></div> <section id=\\"header1\\" class=\\"header1 cid-tVcQvuzi5m mbr-parallax-background\\" data-bs-version=\\"5.1\\"> <div class=\\"mbr-overlay\\" style=\\"opacity:0.2;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\\"></div> <div class=\\"container-fluid\\"> <div class=\\"row\\"> <div class=\\"col-12 col-lg-4\\"> <h1 class=\\"display-1 mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-3\\"><strong>Supervisor</strong></h1> <h2 class=\\"display-2 mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3\\">Web Developer</h2> <p class=\\"mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7\\">A supervisor, or lead, is the job title of a lower-level management position that is primarily based on authority over workers or a workplace.

Methane is emitted by numerous natural and anthropogenic sources, including wetlands, landfills, natural gas and oil production, coal mining, and fermentation processes in the guts of ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the livestock sector is estimated to contribute about 14.5% of all human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, with cattle production representing the majority of these emissions. Methane from enteric fermentation (digestive processes in ruminants) and manure management comprises a substantial portion of these emissions. When discussing the percentage of atmospheric methane specifically attributed to livestock, it's essential to distinguish this from the overall greenhouse gas contributions. Methane accounts for approximately 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions based on the Global Warming Potential (GWP). Within that percentage, livestock (primarily ruminants) are estimated to be responsible for about 32-40% of anthropogenic methane emissions, depending on various estimates and location-specific practices. It is important to note that percentages can change over time with advancements in farming practices, dietary shifts, and policy measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane. These figures also rely on the methodologies used to estimate emissions and on evolving scientific understanding of sources and sinks of methane in the global atmosphere."},{"instruction":"how much methane is produced now compared to the past 10000 years","output":"Over geological timescales, atmospheric methane concentrations have varied significantly. However, data for methane levels over the past 10,000 years—through the Holocene epoch—are particularly useful for understanding the impact of human activities on methane concentrations. Natural sources of methane, such as wetlands, termites, and the oceans, have been present for millennia. Human activities, especially over the past few centuries, have introduced new sources of methane that have contributed to a rapid increase in atmospheric concentrations. Pre-industrial levels of atmospheric methane were relatively stable, fluctuating between roughly 300 to 700 parts per billion (ppb) during the Holocene. This stability changed with the onset of large-scale agriculture and the rise of human populations. Methane levels started to increase significantly with: - The domestication of animals and subsequent advent of livestock farming, which increased methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management. - The development and expansion of rice agriculture, which produces methane through anaerobic decomposition in flooded fields. - The growth of industries such as coal mining and natural gas, which leak methane during extraction and distribution. By the start of the industrial era, around 1750, atmospheric methane levels were approximately 700 ppb. As of 2021, atmospheric methane concentrations were measured at about 1,900 ppb according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), representing an increase by more than 250% from pre-industrial levels. The dramatic rise in atmospheric methane, particularly over the last two centuries, is largely due to increased emissions from anthropogenic sources, which have added to the natural baseline of methane production. This increase correlates with the expansion of industrial activities, changes in land use, and the intensification of agricultural practices associated with a growing human population. Recent trends show that methane emissions continue to rise, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation strategies to reduce contributions from both natural and human-related sources to help combat climate change. Further research and robust monitoring are necessary to better understand and manage methane emissions."},{"instruction":"what about when dinosaurs were alive","output":"During the Mesozoic era, which includes the time when dinosaurs were alive (approximately 252 to 66 million years ago), Earth's atmospheric methane levels were likely significantly different compared to today. Back then, the climate, vegetation, and the presence of large methane-producing sources such as wetlands were distinct from current conditions. The exact methane levels during the Mesozoic are not well known, primarily because our ability to directly measure these concentrations is limited to ice core records that go back only about 800,000 years. However, scientists use various proxies and modeling techniques to estimate greenhouse gas levels in Earth's deep past. During certain periods of the Mesozoic, it is believed that methane concentrations might have been much higher than today's levels due to several factors, including: 1. Widespread volcanic activity, which can release significant amounts of methane and other gases into the atmosphere. 2. Anoxic ocean conditions, which can lead to increased production of methane by archaea (single-celled microorganisms) in ocean sediments. 3. Extensive wetlands and warm climates, which would have favored increased natural methane emissions. 4. Potential methane releases from the decomposition of vast amounts of organic matter and from methane clathrates—crystalline structures of methane trapped within ice-like cages of water molecules found in permafrost and ocean sediments. The presence of enormous herbivorous dinosaurs, such as sauropods, may have also contributed to methane production through enteric fermentation—similar to how modern cows and other ruminants produce methane during their digestive process. However, it's essential to realize that the exact impact of dinosaurs on global methane levels is speculative and would likely be small compared to the enormous sizes of natural wetland sources and geological emissions at the time. Overall, atmospheric methane levels likely underwent significant fluctuations throughout Earth's history due to a wide range of factors, including biological activity, geological events, and changes in Earth's climate. These factors influenced atmospheric composition and climate on timescales spanning millions of years."},{"instruction":"at what point does methane become a problem","output":"Methane becomes a problem primarily due to its potent greenhouse effect. While methane is less abundant in the Earth's atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), it is much more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Over a 100-year period, methane has a global warming potential (GWP) more than 25 times greater than that of CO2—though recent assessments suggest this may be even higher, considering methane’s stronger warming influence over shorter timescales. The concentration of methane becomes problematic when it contributes to an enhanced greenhouse effect, leading to warming on a global scale. This process can: 1. Accelerate climate change: Increasing global temperatures impact weather patterns, polar ice melt, sea level rise, and can lead to more extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves. 2. Affect air quality: Methane is a precursor to ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant that can have serious consequences for human health and agricultural productivity. 3. Destabilize other carbon stores: Warming can lead to permafrost thaw, which releases more methane and CO2 that further exacerbate the greenhouse effect. 4. Positive Feedback Loops: As methane causes warming, this can trigger other sources of methane (like permafrost, methane hydrates, and wetlands) to release more methane, creating a positive feedback loop that leads to more warming. The problem is not the presence of methane itself—as it is a naturally occurring gas, necessary for many ecological processes—but its excess concentration, which has been significantly amplified due to human activities, particularly since the Industrial Revolution. Mitigating methane emissions is critical since reducing methane in the atmosphere has the potential for rapid climate benefits due to its relatively short atmospheric lifetime (about 12 years) compared to CO2 (which can remain in the atmosphere for centuries). Measurements and policy assessments often use a \\"threshold\\" approach, setting target levels or percentages for emissions reductions rather than defining a specific atmospheric concentration that poses a danger. These targets are designed to prevent the global average temperature from rising beyond certain limits, such as those set in the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels."},{"instruction":"how long can c02 remain in the atmosphere","output":"Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a complex life cycle in the Earth's atmosphere due to its interactions with the biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. Unlike other greenhouse gases, CO2 does not have a single, well-defined atmospheric lifetime. This is because CO2 is continuously exchanged between the atmosphere, oceans, and land through various processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, dissolution in water, and chemical weathering. A portion of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is rapidly absorbed by the ocean's surface layer and by land plants. However, the processes that remove the remaining CO2 from the atmosphere happen over much longer timescales: 1. **Fast Removal Process**: Around 50% of the CO2 emitted by human activities is removed from the atmosphere within 30 to 50 years as it is taken up by oceanic uptake and plant growth. 2. **Intermediate Process**: A further 30% of emitted CO2 is gradually removed over a few centuries as deeper ocean layers take up more CO2. 3. **Very Slow Process**: The final 20% of the added CO2 can persist for several thousands of years in the atmosphere, as it is only slowly removed by processes such as rock weathering and sedimentation, which ultimately lead to the formation of carbonate minerals. Because of these varied removal mechanisms and rates, it's not accurate to describe CO2's persistence in terms of a simple lifetime. Instead, scientists often use the concept of \\"climate-carbon feedbacks\\" to explain how the Earth system responds to and adjusts for excess CO2. It is important to note that while individual CO2 molecules may cycle through the atmosphere relatively fast, the additional CO2 released by human activities accumulates over time. This means that even if emissions were drastically reduced, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 would decrease slowly. For climate policy and modeling, this accumulation factor is critical, as the long-term warming effect of CO2 depends on the total buildup of atmospheric CO2 over time, not just its annual emission rate."},{"instruction":"how does methane breakdown in the atmosphere and what are its byproducts","output":"Methane (CH4) breaks down in the atmosphere primarily through a series of reactions involving hydroxyl radicals (OH), which are highly reactive molecules that act as a natural \\"detergent\\" in the atmosphere. The main steps in the oxidation process and the resulting byproducts are as follows: 1. **Initial Reaction with Hydroxyl Radicals**: CH4 + OH → CH3 + H2O In this reaction, a hydroxyl radical (OH) reacts with a methane molecule, removing one hydrogen atom to form a methyl radical (CH3) and producing water vapor (H2O). 2. **Formation of Formaldehyde**: CH3 + O2 + M → CH3O2 + M (where M represents a third body, e.g., a nitrogen molecule N2, that absorbs excess energy from the collision) The highly reactive methyl radical (CH3) then reacts quickly with molecular oxygen (O2) to form a methyl peroxy radical (CH3O2). CH3O2 + NO → CH3O + NO2 The methyl peroxy radical reacts with nitrogen monoxide (NO), producing formaldehyde (CH2O) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). 3. **Further Oxidation**: CH2O + OH → HCO + H2O Formaldehyde is further oxidized by OH radicals to form the formyl radical (HCO). HCO + O2 → CO + HO2 The formyl radical reacts with oxygen to produce carbon monoxide (CO) and a hydroperoxy radical (HO2). 4. **Conversion to Carbon Dioxide**: CO + OH → CO2 + H Finally, carbon monoxide reacts with OH to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and a hydrogen atom (H). These reactions can lead to the formation of tropospheric (ground-level) ozone and contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosols, which are components of particulate matter in the atmosphere. Additionally, the nitrogen dioxide produced can participate in photochemical reactions to also create ozone, particularly in the presence of sunlight. The entire process, from methane to carbon dioxide, takes place over a period of about a decade. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapor (H2O), and other reactive compounds play a role in the breakdown of methane, affecting its concentration and life cycle in the atmosphere. Ultimately, the breakdown of methane produces CO2, a less potent but longer-lived greenhouse gas. Even though the resulting CO2 has a lower warming potential per molecule than methane, it contributes to the long-term accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, given its longevity."},{"instruction":"\\"C:UsersrooosDesktopqe-7.2\\" can you re-write this to mount that folder un ubuntu please","output":"In Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution), you cannot directly use a Windows-style path as you've provided, because the filesystem hierarchy is different.

Installing Quantum ESPRESSO on Ubuntu can indeed be a detailed process due to its dependencies. Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) is a package for ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and requires certain libraries and compilers to be installed first. Below I've provided the general steps you need to follow to successfully install QE on Ubuntu: 1. **Install required dependencies:** Before installing Quantum ESPRESSO, you need to have a Fortran compiler, MPI (Message Passing Interface) library, BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package), and FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) installed on your system. You can install these dependencies by running: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran libfftw3-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev libscalapack-mpi-dev libblacs-mpi-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-common openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev \`\`\` This command will install the GNU Fortran compiler, OpenMPI, FFTW, as well as BLAS and LAPACK libraries that are required for compiling Quantum ESPRESSO. 2. **Download Quantum ESPRESSO:** The next step is to obtain the Quantum ESPRESSO source code package. You can download it from the official website (https://www.quantum-espresso.org/download) or directly using \`wget\` with the link to the QE version you wish to download. Make sure you navigate to an appropriate directory where you have permissions to download and compile software. \`\`\`bash wget https://github.com/QEF/q-e/releases/download/qe-7.2/qe-7.2-release-pack.tgz \`\`\` 3. **Extract the downloaded file:** \`\`\`bash tar -zxvf qe-7.2-release-pack.tgz \`\`\` 4. **Navigate to the Quantum ESPRESSO directory:** \`\`\`bash cd qe-7.2 \`\`\` 5. **Configure the installation:** Run the configure script provided with Quantum ESPRESSO to prepare the build system, you may need to specify the compilers or libraries if they are not automatically found. \`\`\`bash ./configure \`\`\` If you encounter errors during configure, you may need to set environment variables or pass additional options to the configure script to point it to the correct compilers or libraries on your system. 6. **Compile Quantum ESPRESSO:** After successfully running the configure step without errors, you can compile Quantum ESPRESSO. \`\`\`bash make all \`\`\` This will build all the executables for Quantum ESPRESSO. Depending on the number of processing cores your system has, you can speed up the compilation by running \`make -jN all\`, where N is the number of cores you want to allocate for the build process (usually one less than the total number of cores you have). 7. **Testing the Installation:** After the compilation finishes, it's a good idea to run the included test suite to make sure everything is working correctly. \`\`\`bash make check \`\`\` 8. **Using Quantum ESPRESSO:** Once compiled, the binaries will be in the \`bin/\` directory inside the Quantum ESPRESSO directory. It is often convenient to add this directory to your \`PATH\` variable so that you can run the QE executables from anywhere. You can do this by adding the following line to your \`.bashrc\` or \`.profile\` file in your home directory (replace \`/path/to/qe-7.2/\` with the actual path to the QE directory): \`\`\`bash export PATH=/path/to/qe-7.2/bin:PATH \`\`\` Then source your \`.bashrc\` or \`.profile\` to update your environment: \`\`\`bash source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.profile \`\`\` After these steps, Quantum ESPRESSO should be ready to use on your Ubuntu system. Remember that you need to have all the dependencies properly installed, and you also need to be in the correct directory with read and write permissions to download, extract, and compile QE.

However, it appears that you're already bypassing this issue using the \`-fallow-argument-mismatch\` compiler flag, which allows the GNU Fortran compiler to proceed with compilation despite argument mismatches. This flag was introduced to handle changes in argument checking starting from GCC 10, where the compiler became stricter about type checking of function arguments. While the code may compile with warnings using this flag, it's essential to be cautious as this could potentially lead to undefined behavior at runtime if the arguments do not conform to the expected types. If these warnings are coming from the Quantum ESPRESSO source code and not from code you've written or modified, it's less likely, though not impossible, that they will cause issues, as the Quantum ESPRESSO developers would have ensured the code is functional. To address this warning properly, you should: 1. Ensure you are using compatible and recommended compiler versions according to QE's documentation or user forums. 2. Use the same version of the MPI wrapper and compiler that the QE was tested with (typically the GNU compilers or Intel compilers). 3. Check that all dependencies and libraries are installed correctly and are compatible with the compiler you're using. 4. Review any available forums or user communities for similar warnings in your QE version to see if there are suggested fixes or patches. If this is an acceptable risk or if the \`fallow-argument-mismatch\` flag is being recommended by Quantum ESPRESSO's installation instructions due to known issues with the Fortran compiler version being used, you may continue with your installation. However, you should be thorough in testing your QE installation with different calculations to trust the results. If you're unsure whether the code will execute correctly, you might want to reach out to the Quantum ESPRESSO community for more in-depth support on this topic. Please note that while you can ignore these warnings, it's still important to understand why they are occurring and whether they might impact the results of your simulations. If these warnings are resulting from your modifications to the code or if using a different version of the compiler than what QE was tested with, you may need to inspect the code and correct the type inconsistencies."},{"instruction":"well we used the microsoft MPI wrapper i believe , when we originally tried to install this with windows os","output":"Using the Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI) library on Windows is a common approach for parallelized applications; however, on Ubuntu (and Linux distributions in general), you would typically use a different implementation of MPI such as OpenMPI or MPICH. If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run Ubuntu on a Windows machine and want to work with Quantum ESPRESSO, you should install an MPI implementation that is compatible with Linux. As previously mentioned, OpenMPI is a popular choice and is readily available via the package manager in Ubuntu. Here are the steps to install OpenMPI on Ubuntu under WSL: 1. Open your Ubuntu terminal on WSL. 2. Update your package lists: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update \`\`\` 3. Install OpenMPI: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev \`\`\` After installation, you can use the \`mpif90\` and \`mpicc\` wrappers provided by OpenMPI when compiling Quantum ESPRESSO. You do not need to use the MS-MPI wrappers within WSL because the MPI implementation should match the operating system you're running the simulations on. So if you were initially trying to install Quantum ESPRESSO with Windows OS and MS-MPI and are now transitioning to Ubuntu (on WSL or otherwise), ensure that you switch to an MPI implementation that's compatible with Linux as described above. Remember that when you invoke compilation with the \`mpif90\` wrapper in the Ubuntu terminal, it should now use OpenMPI's Fortran wrapper. Similarly, \`mpicc\` will use OpenMPI's C wrapper, ensuring correct integration with the Linux environment and Quantum ESPRESSO's parallelization requirements."},{"instruction":"ok well its all there and it had the openmpi already . so all i can do now is just let ir continue with the make all , everything should be in place , i'll assume it will be fine and we can do the check command once its finished","output":"Yes, if you have all the dependencies installed, including OpenMPI, and the \`./configure\` step completed successfully without any errors, you can proceed with the \`make all\` command to compile Quantum ESPRESSO. The compilation process will produce several executables and libraries that are part of the QE suite. Here are your next steps: 1. **Compile Quantum ESPRESSO:** \`\`\`bash make all \`\`\` As mentioned before, if you have a multi-core processor, you can speed up the compilation by using the \`-j\` option with \`make\` to run multiple jobs in parallel. For example, if you have 4 cores, you can run: \`\`\`bash make -j4 all \`\`\` 2. **Run Tests:** After the compilation is complete, it's recommended to run the test suite to ensure that your QE installation is working correctly. The tests verify that the executables behave as expected. \`\`\`bash make check \`\`\` 3. **Testing Individual Executables:** Alternatively, if you want to test individual executables, you can navigate to the \`test-suite\` folder and run specific tests following the instructions provided by QE. \`\`\`bash cd test-suite ./run-tests.sh \`\`\` 4. **Using Quantum ESPRESSO:** Upon successful compilation and testing, the QE executables will be ready to use. They are generally located in the \`bin/\` subdirectory of your QE installation directory. To run QE programs, you can either navigate to this directory each time or add the path to your system's \`PATH\` variable as previously described. It's important to keep output from the compile and test stages. Review any warnings or errors that come up—they may be critical, or they could be benign and expected with certain compiler and library combinations. If you encounter any errors that stop QE from compiling or running properly, those will need to be addressed before you can reliably use QE for your simulations. Remember, support and more detailed installation instructions are often available from the Quantum ESPRESSO user forums, mailing lists, or official documentation if you encounter any issues. Good luck with your installation!"},{"instruction":"ok one more time , how do i do the configure step","output":"The \`configure\` step in software compilation is a common preliminary process that checks for the presence of required libraries and tools, sets up the correct compiler flags, and prepares the build environment based on your specific system configuration. This ensures that the software you are compiling is optimized for your system. For Quantum ESPRESSO, here is how you can perform the \`configure\` step: 1. **Open a Terminal.** If you're using Ubuntu through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), open your WSL terminal. If you're on a native Linux system, open a standard terminal window. 2. **Navigate to the QE Source Directory.** Ensure you're in the directory where you have extracted Quantum ESPRESSO's source code. For example: \`\`\`bash cd /path/to/qe-7.2 \`\`\` Replace \`/path/to/\` with the actual path to the directory containing the QE source files. 3. **Run the Configure Script.** You can run the \`configure\` script provided with the Quantum ESPRESSO source package. This script will attempt to detect your system's compilers, MPI implementation, and any required libraries. \`\`\`bash ./configure \`\`\` 4. **Pay Attention to the Output.** As the \`configure\` script runs, it will print messages to the terminal. Look out for any \\"error\\" messages that could indicate a problem with finding the required tools or libraries on your system. If there are no errors, the script will successfully generate a \`make.inc\` file that contains the configurations used for the compilation. Sometimes, it may be necessary to specify compilers or libraries manually if the \`configure\` script cannot find them or chooses non-optimal settings. For example, if you want to use a specific Fortran compiler like \`gfortran\`, you can specify it like this: \`\`\`bash ./configure FC=gfortran \`\`\` Similarly, if you want to specify the location of certain libraries like BLAS or LAPACK, you might use: \`\`\`bash ./configure BLAS_LIBS=\\"/path/to/blas\\" LAPACK_LIBS=\\"/path/to/lapack\\" \`\`\` Replace \`\\"/path/to/blas\\"\` and \`\\"/path/to/lapack\\"\` with the actual paths to the libraries on your systems, such as \`BLAS_LIBS=\\"-lblas\\"\` and \`LAPACK_LIBS=\\"-llapack\\"\` if they are installed in standard locations and can be linked by just using the library name. If you encounter any issues during the configuration, you should resolve them before proceeding with the compilation (\`make all\`). Moreover, after \`configure\` completes successfully, it's generally a good idea to review the \`make.inc\` file it produces to confirm that it has selected the expected compilers and libraries for the build. Once the \`configure\` process has been completed successfully, you can proceed with \`make all\` to compile Quantum ESPRESSO. If you encounter errors during compilation, consult the \`config.log\` file for clarifying details on the error(s) encountered."},{"instruction":"neither make check nor the test suite works","output":"If \`make check\` or the test suite isn't working after compiling Quantum ESPRESSO, there may be a few issues to consider: 1. **Incomplete Compilation**: Ensure that the \`make all\` process completed successfully without errors. If the compilation failed, none of the binaries would have been created, therefore making \`make check\` fail. 2. **Environment Setup**: Quantum ESPRESSO's test suite may rely on certain environment variables being correctly set. Check the documentation or the output of the \`configure\` script to ensure all necessary environment variables are set. 3. **Path Issues**: The test suite expects the QE executables to be in your \`PATH\`, or it may expect certain environment variables pointing to the QE binaries. If the test suite scripts cannot find the executables, the tests will not run. 4. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts and access all directories and files involved in the tests. 5. **Dependencies**: If certain libraries or tools that the test suite relies on are not installed or correctly configured, the tests will not execute successfully. This could include MPI, BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, etc. 6. **Broken Tests**: Sometimes, individual test cases may be broken in certain versions or with certain configurations. You can attempt to run individual tests to narrow down the issue. 7. **Corrupted Downloads**: If the QE source code was not fully or correctly downloaded, some parts of the test suite may be missing or corrupted. Addressing these issues typically involves checking the output generated during the \`make all\` and \`make check\` processes for errors. You can also look into the following: - **Review the \`make\` output**: Check the output when you run \`make all\` to see if all executables are indeed compiled without error. Warnings are often okay, but errors usually indicate a compilation failure that must be resolved. - **Run a simple test manually**: Attempt to run one of the executables manually with a simple test input to see if it's a problem with the test scripts or the QE executables themselves. - **Consult the QE forums or mailing list**: Sometimes the issues are known to the user community, and solutions are shared through these channels. - **Follow the Quantum ESPRESSO Documentation**: Make sure you followed all steps suggested by the official documentation for the version you're compiling. - **Look into \`test-suite\` logs**: If individual tests are being run but failing, check the logs within the \`test-suite\` directory. These logs may provide clues about what is going wrong with the tests. If you do find specific error messages or details leading to the failure, those would significantly help to troubleshoot and resolve the issues with the test suite."},{"instruction":"bod@DESKTOP-QBBH6L5:/mnt/c/Users/rooos/Desktop/qe-7.2 make check make: *** No rule to make target 'check'.

Additionally, the \`run-tests.sh\` script is not found in the \`test-suite\` directory, which implies that either the script is not included in your version or something went wrong during the download or extraction of the QE package. Here are several steps to troubleshoot these issues: 1. **Check Makefile Targets**: Investigate the available targets in the Makefile by listing them with the following command, executed in the \`/mnt/c/Users/rooos/Desktop/qe-7.2\` directory: \`\`\`bash make -p | grep -i -E '^[a-z0-9_-]+:.*' | grep -v '^.' | sort -u \`\`\` This command will list the targets defined in the Makefile. Look to see if there's an alternative to \`check\`, such as \`test\` or similar. 2. **Reconfirm QE Version**: Ensure that the version of Quantum ESPRESSO you have downloaded indeed comes with testing capabilities. It is also possible that testing scripts are only available in specific versions or packages of the software. Check the official Quantum ESPRESSO website or repository to confirm. 3. **Re-download and Extract QE**: If the \`test-suite\` directory is supposed to contain \`run-tests.sh\` and does not, your download or extraction might be incomplete or corrupt. Redownload the package from the official source and extract the files again to ensure you have all the necessary scripts. \`\`\`bash wget https://github.com/QEF/q-e/releases/download/qe-7.2/qe-7.2-release-pack.tgz tar -zxvf qe-7.2-release-pack.tgz \`\`\` 4. **Check the \`test-suite\` Contents**: The \`run-tests.sh\` script might be missing or have a different name. Check the contents of the \`test-suite\` directory: \`\`\`bash ls -l \`\`\` Look for any \`.sh\` files or other scripts that may be intended to run the test suite. 5. **Manually Run a Test**: If there is no script but there are test input files available, you can try to run a test manually using one of the QE executables to ensure they are working correctly: \`\`\`bash pw.x < test_input.in > test_output.out \`\`\` Replace \`test_input.in\` with an actual test input file provided in the \`test-suite\` directory or other similar directories within the QE installation structure. 6. **Consult the Documentation or Community**: Check the Quantum ESPRESSO documentation for instructions on how to run tests or seek help from the community forums or mailing lists. They might provide additional insights or updated testing procedures. Missing test scripts or test targets could be specific to the package version or download source.

This implies that the standard procedure for running tests, as described in the README, may not be applicable to this particular version of Quantum ESPRESSO or may not be included by default. Here are some suggestions: 1. **Verify Available Make Targets**: First, verify if there are indeed no testing targets as part of the \`make\` configuration. If the \`make\` command with no arguments is supposed to print a list of acceptable targets, you can run the following command in the QE root directory: \`\`\`bash make \`\`\` This should list all available \`make\` targets. Look for anything that resembles a test target (like \`test\`, \`check\`, \`tests\`, etc.). 2. **Search for a Testing Procedure**: Look for any alternative testing procedures in the documentation. There may be different instructions on how to perform testing, perhaps involving manually running specific executables with test inputs. Check the \`Doc/\` directory or any other \`*/Doc/\` directories for additional information. 3. **Inspect the QE Documentation Online**: Check the website (http://www.quantum-espresso.org/) or the GitLab Wiki page (https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/wikis/home) for the most up-to-date testing procedures. Sometimes, the online documentation is more current than the text files included with the source code. 4. **Build and Test Manually**: If you successfully compiled QE, you can perform a simple validation by running one of the programs with a sample input file to see if it behaves correctly. This will not be as comprehensive as running a full test suite but can give you confidence that the programs are operational. Navigate to the \`bin/\` directory where the executables are located and find an example input file from the QE website or other sources. Run a QE component, for example, \`pw.x\`, with the input file: \`\`\`bash ./pw.x < example.in > example.out \`\`\` Review the \`example.out\` file for any obvious errors or warnings. 5. **Community Support**: If you're still unsure about the testing procedures, consider reaching out to the Quantum ESPRESSO community through mailing lists, forums, or their GitLab repository for guidance. In summary, it seems the \`make check\` target is not mentioned in the README—which usually suggests that testing has to be done either manually or through some other means not covered by the \`make\` configuration. Always ensure you follow the latest instructions provided via the official channels for the software."},{"instruction":"there is a sub folder names test suite , so maybe i need to cd onto that or whatever its called in linux","output":"If there is a \`test-suite\` subfolder within the Quantum ESPRESSO directory, it's possible that the test suite must be navigated to and run from there. It's common for software packages to include a separate test directory with its own set of instructions or scripts for running tests. Here's what you can try: 1. **Navigate to the \`test-suite\` Directory:** \`\`\`bash cd /mnt/c/Users/rooos/Desktop/qe-7.2/test-suite \`\`\` 2. **Check the Contents of the \`test-suite\` Directory:** Use the \`ls\` command to list the contents of the \`test-suite\` directory. \`\`\`bash ls -l \`\`\` Look for any scripts (files ending with \`.sh\`) or README files that might instruct you on how to run the tests. There could be a README specific to tests or other documentation. 3. **Look for and Run the Test Script:** If you do find an executable shell script (i.e., a file ending in \`.sh\`), you can run it with the following command: \`\`\`bash ./script_name.sh \`\`\` Replace \`script_name.sh\` with the actual name of the script you find. 4. **Read Any Associated Documentation:** Open any README or similar files in the directory for instructions. You can read a text file in the terminal using the \`cat\`, \`less\`, or \`nano\` commands: \`\`\`bash cat README \`\`\` or, to scroll through the document, \`\`\`bash less README \`\`\` 5. **Manually Run Individual Tests:** If there are input files but no scripts, you might need to run tests manually. Each test directory within \`test-suite\` typically has input and reference output files for different QE components (e.g., \`pw.x\`, \`ph.x\`, \`dos.x\`, etc.). You run a test by executing the Quantum ESPRESSO binary with the provided input file and comparing your results to the reference output. An example for \`pw.x\` might look like this: \`\`\`bash cd pw # If there is a subdirectory for pw.x tests ../../bin/pw.x < pw-test.in > pw-test.out \`\`\` Compare \`pw-test.out\` to the reference output files provided to check for correctness. Remember, you'll need to ensure that any required environment variables, especially those related to MPI and QE's binaries, are appropriately set for the tests to run successfully. If there are issues with permissions or missing scripts, ensure that executing rights (\`chmod +x script_name.sh\`) are set, or you may have to re-download the QE package to check for any missing files.

Visit the Quantum ESPRESSO pseudopotentials library page or the location where they provide their pseudopotentials. If the repository URL is not known, you might be able to find it on the Quantum ESPRESSO website or in the documentation. 2. Navigate to the appropriate pseudopotentials for hydrogen, which is likely to be under PBE functionals. 3. Download the \`H.pbe-vbc.UPF\` file directly to the directory where the \`check_pseudo.sh\` script expects it. If the script doesn't specify a directory, you can generally place it in a \`pseudo/\` or \`pseudopotentials/\` directory within the QE directory structure. 4. Once the pseudopotential file is in place, re-run the \`check_pseudo.sh\` script.

This might happen due to a variety of reasons, such as issues with the environment configuration, incorrect compilation, missing dependencies, or problems with the input files and test setup. Let's go over some steps to diagnose the problem: 1. **Check Environment and Modules**: Ensure that the environment variables for compilers and libraries like MPI, BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW are correctly set. 2. **Inspect Compilation**: Verify that Quantum ESPRESSO was compiled successfully. Look for errors or warnings in the output when you ran \`make all\`. If there were issues, they might need to be resolved before running the tests. 3. **Re-run Configuration**: Rerun the \`./configure\` step to make sure it detects all necessary libraries and sets up the appropriate configurations in the \`make.inc\` file. 4. **Review Test Outputs**: For each failed test, check the corresponding output files or logs in the test directories. Often, these files will contain error messages or clues as to what went wrong. 5. **Test Executables Manually**: Try running one of the QE executables (e.g., \`pw.x\`) manually with a simple test case to see if it can complete successfully. 6. **Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions for the QE executables and test files. 7. **Disk Space and Quotas**: Ensure you have enough disk space and are not exceeding any user quotas, as some tests may require significant temporary storage. 8. **Review Prerequisites**: Make sure you meet all prerequisites for running the tests as mentioned in the documentation, such as specific input files or configuration settings. If you're unable to resolve the issue, please provide specific error messages or log entries, and consider reaching out to the QE user forums or the Quantum ESPRESSO community for support.

Here are some troubleshooting steps: 1. **Inspect Test Output:** Look at the detailed output file for this specific test to see if there are error messages that indicate why the test failed. The output files are typically found in the \`test-suite\` directory, organized by test name. 2. **Correct Input Files:** Make sure that the input file used in the test (\`vc-relax-dos-1.in\`) is not corrupted or altered from the expected version. It should match the version provided with the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution. 3. **Compare Results:** You can try to manually compare the output from your test run with the provided benchmark to see specifically where it differs. Look for any substantial numerical differences or output formatting issues. 4. **Resource Availability:** Make sure your system has enough resources (CPU, memory) for the test to execute correctly. Some simulations might fail if they're unable to allocate sufficient resources. 5. **Consistency with other Tests:** If all tests failed, there might be a global issue with your QE installation or environment setup. Issues that cause a single test to fail might be different from issues that cause all tests to fail. 6. **Recompile Quantum ESPRESSO:** If the issue might stem from the compilation, consider recompiling QE. Ensure that you're using consistent compilers and libraries across the entire build process. 7. **Environment Variables:** Verify once more that all required environment variables are set correctly, including any module loads or library paths required by QE. 8. **Seek Help:** If you're unable to resolve the issue, consider asking for help on the Quantum ESPRESSO forums or mailing lists. Provide details about your system, compilation configuration, and the error messages you're encountering. When reporting an issue to the QE community, it's very helpful to attach the complete output from the failed test(s) as well as the content of your \`make.inc\` file and the steps you've taken during compilation and testing. It gives experts in the community a better chance at diagnosing the issue and providing useful feedback or potential fixes."},{"instruction":"ok lets study this to see if i missed something : There are many examples and reference data for almost every piece of QUANTUM ESPRESSO, but you have to manually inspect the results. In order to use examples, you should edit file environment_variables, setting the following variables as needed. BIN_DIR: directory where executables reside PSEUDO_DIR: directory where pseudopotential files reside TMP_DIR: directory to be used as temporary storage area The default values of BIN_DIR and PSEUDO_DIR should be fine, unless you have installed things in nonstandard places. TMP_DIR must be a directory where you have read and write access to, with enough available space to host the temporary files produced by the example runs, and possibly offering high I/O performance (i.e., don't use an NFS-mounted directory). NOTA BENE: do not use a directory containing other data: the examples will clean it! If you have compiled the parallel version of QUANTUM ESPRESSO (this is the default if parallel libraries are detected), you will usually have to specify a launcher program (such as mpirun or mpiexec) and the number of processors: see Sec.3 for details. In order to do that, edit again the environment_variables file and set the PARA_PREFIX and PARA_POSTFIX variables as needed. Parallel executables will be run by a command like this: PARA_PREFIX pw.x PARA_POSTFIX -i file.in > file.out For example, if the command line is like this (as for an IBM SP): mpirun -np 4 pw.x -i file.in > file.out you should set PARA_PREFIX=\\"mpirun -np 4\\", PARA_POSTFIX=\\"\\". Furthermore, if your machine does not support interactive use, you must run the commands specified above through the batch queuing system installed on that machine. Ask your system administrator for instructions. For execution using OpenMP on N threads, use PARA_PREFIX=\\"env OMP_NUM_THREADS=N ... \\". To run an example, go to the corresponding directory (e.g. PW/examples/example01) and execute: ./run_example This will create a subdirectory results/, containing the input and output files generated by the calculation. Some examples take only a few seconds to run, while others may require up to several minutes. In each example's directory, the reference/ subdirectory contains verified output files, that you can check your results against. You may get slightly different reesults on different machines, in particular if different FFT dimensions are automatically selected. For this reason, a plain diff of your results against the reference data doesn't work, or at least, it requires human inspection of the results. The example scripts stop if an error is detected. You should look inside the last written output file to understand why.","output":"Based on the instructions provided, it looks like there are a few key points to ensure the Quantum ESPRESSO examples and tests run correctly: 1. **Set Environment Variables**: Edit the \`environment_variables\` file to set \`BIN_DIR\`, \`PSEUDO_DIR\`, and \`TMP_DIR\` properly. - \`BIN_DIR\`: Should point to the directory containing QE executables. - \`PSEUDO_DIR\`: Should point to the directory containing pseudopotential files. - \`TMP_DIR\`: Should be set to a temporary storage area where you have read and write access. 2. **Check Temporary Directory**: Ensure that the \`TMP_DIR\` is a local directory, not located on a network drive, and that it does not contain other important data since it will be cleaned by the tests. 3. **Parallel Execution Setup**: If you compiled the parallel version of QE, make sure to set \`PARA_PREFIX\` and \`PARA_POSTFIX\` to include your MPI launcher (like \`mpirun\` or \`mpiexec\`) and the correct number of processors. 4. **Running QE through a Batch System**: If your system doesn't support interactive use, you'll need to run QE through the batch queuing system. Contact your system administrator for the right commands and submission scripts. 5. **Running Examples**: To execute an example, move to the specific example directory (e.g., \`PW/examples/example01\`) and run the \`./run_example\` script. Each example will generate results in a \`results/\` subdirectory. 6. **Checking Results**: The \`reference/\` subdirectory contains verified output files. You can compare your results against these but expect some minor discrepancies due to machine-specific factors. 7. **Error Handling**: If an example script stops, check the last output file generated for any error messages to understand why it failed. Based on this, if you're facing issues with running tests, you should: - Verify that \`environment_variables\` file contains correct paths. - Check if \`TMP_DIR\` is appropriately set and that it has adequate storage and permission settings. - If parallel execution is involved, ensure \`PARA_PREFIX\` and \`PARA_POSTFIX\` are correctly set up for your specific MPI environment. - If examples fail, look into the corresponding output files for errors. If you've already followed these steps and the tests are still failing, you may want to recheck the compilation of QE, ensuring that all dependencies were properly linked when building the executables, and that all of the above instructions have been followed accurately. If problems persist, reaching out to the QE user community with specific details of what you have done and the errors you are encountering would be the next step."},{"instruction":"well since i did have errors i'd like to recheck the compilation of QE, ensuring that all dependencies were properly linked when building the executables. lets go 1 step at a time this is complex so lets do tiny bites without writing lots of information , its becoming overwhelming now","output":"Absolutely, let's tackle this step by step. The first thing we want to do is verify that the \`configure\` step reports no errors and correctly finds all dependencies. **Step 1: Run the Configure Script** In the Quantum ESPRESSO directory, execute: \`\`\`bash ./configure \`\`\` Watch the output for any messages about missing dependencies or other errors. If \`configure\` completes successfully, it will create a file named \`make.inc\` that includes the configuration for compilation. Please run this and let me know if the script completes without errors."},{"instruction":"/mnt/c/Users/rooos/Desktop/qe-7.2/test-suite ./configure -bash: ./configure: No such file or directory .... lol puts head in hands ... ekkkk","output":"It looks like you're trying to run \`./configure\` from within the \`test-suite\` directory, but the \`configure\` script should be located in the root directory of the Quantum ESPRESSO source code, not inside the \`test-suite\`. You'll need to navigate back to the main QE directory where you extracted the source files. Here’s what you should do: **Step 1: Navigate to the QE Source Directory** \`\`\`bash cd /mnt/c/Users/rooos/Desktop/qe-7.2 \`\`\` **Step 2: Run the Configure Script from the QE Source Directory** \`\`\`bash ./configure \`\`\` Now, watch the output for any messages about missing dependencies or other errors. If everything is fine, the script should report that it finished successfully and create the \`make.inc\` file.

This configure script attempts to find them, but may fail if they have been installed in non-standard locations. If a required library is not found, the local copy will be compiled. The following libraries have been found: BLAS_LIBS= -lblas LAPACK_LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -llapack -lblas FFT_LIBS= -lfftw3 Please check if this is what you expect. If any libraries are missing, you may specify a list of directories to search and retry, as follows: ./configure LIBDIRS=\\"list of directories, separated by spaces\\" Parallel environment detected successfully. Configured for compilation of parallel executables. For more info, read the ESPRESSO User's Guide (Doc/users-guide.tex). -------------------------------------------------------------------- configure: success","output":"Great, the \`configure\` script ran successfully. **Step 2: Examine the Makefile Configuration** The \`configure\` script generated the \`make.inc\` file with settings for your system. It's useful to take a glance at this file to ensure it correctly reflects your desired compile options and library paths for BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, and others. \`\`\`bash cat make.inc \`\`\` Run this command, and check to see if the paths and library flags for BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW look correct.

A \`./configure\` command is executed, which initiates the configuration process to tailor-make the software for your specific system. 2. The configure script attempts to check for the necessary compilers, libraries, and MPI (Message Passing Interface) environment. It does so in the following steps: - It checks for the Fortran and C compilers (\`gfortran\` and \`cc\` respectively), and the parallel Fortran compiler \`mpif90\`. - It looks for libraries like BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW, which are essential for high-performance matrix operations and Fast Fourier Transforms, needed for efficient computation in QE. 3. The script found the standard versions of BLAS and LAPACK libraries and the FFTW3 library. However, it did not find the optimized Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library) or any trace of the ELPA library. If these are installed in non-standard locations, they may not be detected, and the local unoptimized versions will be used instead. 4. The configure script did not enable legacy plugins and it appears that MPI is configured correctly for parallel execution. 5.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how young adolescent girls have an innate reluctant towards becoming pregnant even if biologically they are capable of becoming pregnant due to the onset of puberty. Ignore the cultural or social environment and exclusive examine in isolation the mentality of the girls.","output":"The proposition at hand ushers us into the nuanced realm of young adolescent girls' psyches in relation to their innate reluctances towards pregnancy despite their biological capabilities. Unfettered by the throes of cultural and societal norms, this analysis delves deeply into the inherent mental frameworks and predispositions of these young individuals who stand at the cusp of their reproductive viability. As one begins to articulate the underlying facets of this reluctance, there is a sense of psychological incongruity that presents itself between the nascent potential for motherhood and the personal readiness to assume such an identity. In dissecting this palpable hesitation, it is crucial to recognize that cognitive development during adolescence is marked by a burgeoning sense of self and an introspective evaluation of one's immediate capabilities and future aspirations. The cognitive architecture that scaffolds the thought processes of these girls is awash with considerations about self-identity and the responsibility tethered inextricably to pregnancy and parenthood. Their minds, vibrant with the abstract reasoning acquired during cognitive maturation, grapple with the profound implications of childbearing. An illustrative example of this reluctance can be traced to the psychological phenomenon known as the 'imaginary audience,' where adolescents often feel that they are under the constant scrutiny of their peers and society at large. The specter of pregnancy can evoke a subconscious projection of vulnerability and a perceived forfeiture of the autonomy that these young girls cherish. This sense of exposure and the accompanying emotional tumult form a silent bastion against the idea of early pregnancy. Additionally, the concept of 'future orientation,' a hallmark of adolescent cognitive growth, imparts a predilection towards ambitions and achievements that lie well beyond the immediate realm of motherhood. As these girls navigate the complex labyrinths of their own identity formation, the prospect of pregnancy can appear antithetical to the pursuit of educational attainment and personal growth ambitions. The mind, therefore, instinctively recoils at the notion, recognizing the extensive, irreversible alterations to life trajectory that pregnancy entails. Moreover, the cognitive dissonance engendered by the biological readiness contrasting with emotional and psychological unpreparedness results in an internal tug-of-war. The innate drive for survival and the propagation of genes battles with the advanced cognitive understanding that their young shoulders are not yet primed to bear the weight of a developing life. It must also be mentioned that the very substance of adolescence is a transitional phase—a liminal stage brimming with the potential for transformation and discovery. Pregnant within this stage of life is a silent acknowledgment that the fledgling wings of youth are just learning to flutter and are not yet ready to nurture another life through the trials and tribulations of motherhood. This reluctance, devoid of external social pressure and cultural expectations, is grounded in the internal dialogue sculpted by the intrinsic cognitive evolution characteristic of adolescence. In essence, the phenomenon under analysis is a testament to the complex, delicate, and remarkably profound interior lives of young adolescent girls, who find themselves instinctively averse to embracing pregnancy at a time when their psyches are navigating the profound seas of existential discovery and self-realization."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how the reluctance of girl to become pregnant doesn't extend to other mammals like felines or equines where when those animals are capable of beocming pregnant due to the onset of puberty, they accept their natural inevitability of being impregnated and becoming pregnant.","output":"I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request."},{"instruction":"rewrite","output":"Embarking on a more explicit foray into the innate reluctance of adolescent girls towards pregnancy, a stark juxtaposition emerges when one considers the unhesitating acceptance of reproductive roles in other mammals, such as felines or equines. These non-human species, upon reaching puberty, seamlessly integrate into the natural tapestry of procreation, driven solely by instinctual imperatives without the underpinning of higher cognitive deliberation. To illustrate, consider the domestic cat, whiskered and poised on the brink of its reproductive journey. As it reaches sexual maturity, there is no observable hesitation or introspection. The cycle of estrus ignites an unresisted biological beacon, signaling readiness for mating and subsequent pregnancy. There is no internal conflict or projection of future consequences—merely the fulfillment of an evolutionary script penned by nature’s indifferent hand. Similarly, within the equine world, the mare’s entry into puberty is characterized by a humble acquiescence to the reproductive demands of her species. Spring heralds the mare's fertility, and her actions are choreographed by the primal dance of hormones and natural selection. There is an absence of psychological turmoil or existential grappling with the prospect of motherhood. She stands as a testament to biological determinism, where the latent power to birth new life is met with an organic, unquestioning welcome. Contrastingly, the reluctant adolescent girl, cocooned within the chrysalis of her developing consciousness, experiences pregnancy not as an inevitable rite but as a monumental choice that requires profound internal negotiation. It is within the amphitheater of her mind where scenarios are envisioned and futures are painted with the delicate strokes of 'what-ifs.' Unlike her mammalian counterparts, the girl possesses the cognitive sophistication to forecast the manifold outcomes of pregnancy upon her life’s canvas, each with its own rich palette of potential joys and burdens. The innate reluctance can be vividly seen in her piercing self-awareness and burgeoning individuation. The adolescent girl stands at the edge of her own life’s precipice, eyes wide open to the vast expanse of her potential. She understands in a visceral, soul-deep manner, the weight of motherhood—a weight that transcends the mere gestation and delivery of a child, but encompasses the eternal transformation of self and identity. In this respect, her psyche does not merely flinch at the biological possibility of pregnancy; it recoils from the precocious imposition of a role for which she is not yet psychologically tailored. This dichotomy between the girl and other mammals underscores a fundamental truth: that humanity’s complex cognitive architecture endows the young with both the curse of foresight and the blessing of choice. While the four-legged creatures of the earth yield to the unerring rhythms of nature’s design, the young girl faces the profound decision of motherhood with a breadth of vision and a depth of feeling unknown to the denizens of the wild. Her reluctance is the silent whisper of a psyche that knows its own unfolding story is yet to be written, and that the pen must be held with care before it inscribes the indelible line of maternity upon its pages."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how female adolescent introspection is driven largely by the social environment they live in where in a culture that celebrates early motherhood, girls are acclimated into becoming pregnant early on in adolescence.","output":"I must clarify that while the initial request was to exclude cultural and social environments from the analysis, this follow-up inquiry specifically asks to consider the social environment's impact. However, for coherence and comprehensiveness, let's expand upon the initial analysis while incorporating the influence of social environment as a significant factor in female adolescent introspection and their attitudes towards early pregnancy. The reluctance of adolescent girls towards becoming pregnant, which sits rooted in psychological and biological individuality, is starkly contrasted when placed against the backdrop of a specific social environment that venerates early motherhood. In such cultures, the tapestry of communal values and expectations acts as a powerful conductor of individual behavior and personal choices, effectively molding the girls’ innate introspections. Consider communities where the generational tapestry is woven with threads of early childbearing—as a rite of passage, a symbol of status, or a continuity of tradition. In such contexts, adolescent girls are not merely passive recipients of cultural values; they are actively groomed to embrace early procreation as a norm. The communal narrative may laud the role of young motherhood with reverence and pride, casting it as an exalted station, thereby diminishing the personal hesitation some girls might otherwise feel. Illustratively, in some societies, festivals and ceremonies could center around the celebration of fertility, with songs and stories lionizing women who embraced motherhood at a tender age. The young girl, her psyche malleable and receptive, absorbs these exaltations. She might witness her peers, slightly older and now bearing the mantle of early motherhood, treated with a newfound respect and inclusion into a mature fold that was once beyond their reach. This ostensible elevation of status serves as a clarion call that may override individual reticence. Furthermore, the architectural design of some social narratives may entwine womanhood so tightly with the identity of being a mother that for a girl to conceive early symbolizes the ultimate flowering of her femininity. In such an environment, introspection is shaped not by a consideration of personal readiness or holistic future planning, but by the implicit understanding that to become a mother is to fulfill a culturally designated destiny. The subtext communicated to the young girl within these societal constructs is potent. When her own natural introspection—wrestling with the impetus of puberty and the urge towards self-continuity—meets the societal imperative to procreate, the resultant force can tip the scales. The girl's internal narrative, potentially fraught with questions about her preparedness for such a profound life transition, may be rewritten by the external chorus that espouses the normalcy and virtue of swift transitions into motherhood. Crucially, this cultural embrace of early pregnancy can cast a gloss of normality over the entire process, effectively buffering the girl’s mind against the apprehensions that might otherwise surface. Thus, the reluctant adolescent, who might have peered into the future and seen myriad paths before her, is coaxed into a singular trajectory ordained by her heritage. In societies where early motherhood is an accolade, a marker of communal standing or stability, the nuanced reluctance of youth can be but a whisper, swiftly drowned out by the drumbeat of tradition. The girls’ introspections become subsumed beneath a collective consciousness that venerates the swift and early embrace of maternal destiny, demonstrating how the tapestry of cultural values can weave itself into the very fabric of personal choice and identity."},{"instruction":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how young adolescent girls are often more curious about their bodies in terms of biological functions, especially their reproductive organs, than boys of the same age who look at themselves and go with the flow to speak.","output":"In elucidating the proposition that young adolescent girls demonstrate a heightened curiosity regarding their bodies and biological functions compared to their male counterparts, a rich tapestry of psychological, physiological, and developmental threads must be unwoven. The curiosity of adolescent girls about their bodies transcended the mere acknowledgment of change; it evolved into a quest for understanding the profound metamorphoses occurring within them. At the onset of puberty, the young girl's body became a landscape of transformation. Marked by the inaugural menses, her reproductive system announced its functional presence with a biological fanfare that was both intimate and profound. This rite of passage into womanhood served as a catalyst for curiosity. Girls meticulously charted the rhythms of their menstrual cycles, keen to understand the ebb and flow of hormones that now played a conspicuous role in their daily lives. The practical implications of menstruation—managing hygiene, addressing cramps, and navigating an array of emotional changes—demanded from girls an acute and methodical investigation into their own biology. Their exploration was comprehensive, extending beyond mere phenomenological study. Girls delved into the functional whys of their reproductive anatomy with an alacrity driven by the body's tangible signals. Conversations with peers often turned to shared experiences of bodily changes, fostering a collective inquiry that spanned the gamut from ovarian function to the intricacies of the menstrual cycle. Whereas girls were methodically piecing together the puzzle of their developing bodies, boys of the same age typically displayed a more laissez-faire attitude towards their physiological changes. The male pubescent journey, though marked by its own significant milestones, seemed to engender less overt curiosity. Erections and wet dreams, while noted, were less likely to provoke the same meticulous self-scrutiny as the menstrual cycle did in females. Boys might comment among themselves about changes in voice and physique, yet they often shrugged off these transformations as simple facts of growing up—\\"going with the flow,\\" so to speak. This divergence in attitudes was not random but reflective of broader biological imperatives. The female body's readiness for potential maternity introduced complexities that demanded understanding and attention, while the male reproductive role, though important, did not impose the same immediate physiological stewardship upon the adolescent boy. In essence, girls became adept scientists of their own bodies, their curiosity fueled by the necessity to manage and anticipate the workings of their reproductive systems. From a detailed understanding of their fertile windows to the recognition of premenstrual syndrome symptoms, girls amassed a compendium of knowledge about their reproductive health, often becoming conversant in the language of gynecology with ease. They transformed their curiosity into empowered autonomy, seeking information and answers in a society where menstrual taboo had long shrouded such discussions in mystery and euphemism. The adolescent girl, placing herself under the microscope of self-discovery, perceived her body not just as a receptacle of biological inheritance but as a dynamic organism requiring management and care. This curiosity was not merely academic; it spoke of a burgeoning self-agency in the realm of personal health and bodily autonomy. In sum, the pursuit of knowledge about their bodies and reproductive functions was for girls a thorough and necessary acquisition. It was a process characterized by introspection, shared in solidarity with their peers, and often pursued with both clinical precision and personal wonderment. Boys, while no less subject to the whims of biology, embarked upon their pubescent journeys with comparatively less compulsion to decipher their bodies' signals, trusting in the tacit assurances of tradition and time to reveal the fullness of their masculine form and function."},{"instruction":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how this introspection on the part of young adolescent girls allow them to flirt and engage in romantic banter more easily than their male peers.","output":"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I must comply with community guidelines that prevent the creation of explicit, sensual, or vulgar content.

Let me know if you would like me to proceed with this or if you have another question or topic in mind."},{"instruction":"rewrite","output":"Expanding upon the analysis of adolescent girls' curiosity about their bodies and its link to social interactions, it becomes evident that such introspection indeed contributes to a richer understanding of themselves, which in turn may facilitate their ability to engage in romantic banter and flirtation with greater ease than their male peers. The self-knowledge that girls acquire through their meticulous study of their physical changes often translates into a more confident body language and a nuanced understanding of social cues related to attraction and romance. Having invested time in learning the subtleties of their own hormonal cycles, girls become adept at detecting and interpreting the subtle physical and emotional signals in themselves and others. This aptitude confers a certain social dexterity when it comes to romantic interactions. For example, an adolescent girl versed in the ebb and flow of her own emotions related to her menstrual cycle might be more attuned to reading emotional expressions in her peers. She would be more likely to pick up on the fleeting spark of interest in someone's eye or the tentative attempt at engagement from a peer. Such insights underpin the flirtatious exchanges commonplace among adolescents probing the domain of romantic connection. The comparison with male peers reveals a distinct social dynamic. Adolescent boys, while certainly undergoing their own transformative experiences, might not engage with the same level of body literacy. The straightforward nature of their developments—a voice deepening or facial hair sprouting—is often interpreted simply as markers of 'becoming a man,' rather than phenomena to be understood in a larger biological and emotional context. This could, at times, result in a less nuanced understanding of the intricate dance of flirtation. A boy might miss the delicately raised eyebrow or slight tilt of the head that indicates an invitation to converse—a language which a girl, fluent in the lexicon of bodily awareness, would likely interpret with ease. As a result, in the subtle arena of adolescent romance, girls might demonstrate an enhanced capability for engaging in the layered verbiage of flirtation. Through their introspection and resultant body-awareness, these girls have implicitly honed their emotional intelligence. They can navigate the unspoken intricacies of romantic dialogue with finesse, matching their newfound knowledge of self with a sensitivity to the signals of others.

Here's an explanation of the points and potential solutions for common installation problems: 1. **Compilers Must Be Present in PATH**: - Problem: The installation requires working Fortran and C compilers that should be accessible through the system's PATH. If \`configure\` says there is no working compiler, it means the installation script can't find one. - Solution: Ensure that the compilers are installed and their locations are added to the PATH environment variable. You may need to install or provide the path to the compilers recognized by the \`configure\` script. 2. **Compiler Internal Error**: - Problem: You're getting an error that suggests bugs in the compiler you're using, such as when it cannot handle the optimization level specified. - Solution: Try reducing the optimization level for the compilation or disable optimization for the specific routine that's causing trouble. Look for updates or patches for your compiler, or consider upgrading to a newer version of the compiler. 3. **Loading Phase Errors**: - Problems & Solutions: 1. Leftover object files from another compiler may cause the error. Running \`make clean\` before recompiling can remove these files. 2. If \`make\` didn't stop after an error, manually removing the problematic object file (*.o) and recompiling may show where the compilation error occurred. 3. Missing symbols can indicate the need for specifying all necessary libraries (like LAPACK, BLAS, FFTW) and ensuring they are in the correct order. 4. **Segmentation Fault in Tests**: - Problem: Runtime errors like segmentation faults during tests can indicate issues with the compilers, mathematical libraries, MPI libraries, or a combination of these, leading to software incompatibility. - Solution: Check whether your compilers and libraries are up-to-date and compatible with each other; replace or update them if necessary. 5. **Testing Phase Failures**: - Problem: If all tests fail, there may be a clear issue indicated in the output and error files. - Solution: Review the output and error files for any obvious reasons for the failures and address them. 6. **Partial Test Failures**: - Problem: If some tests pass while others fail, it suggests a more specific problem, which might be related to certain functions or compatibility issues. - Solution: Investigate the output and error files for the failed tests to identify and resolve the issue. A common troublemaker could be the complex function \`zdotc\`. It's important to note that installation problems can also arise from incorrect settings, permissions, or conflicts with existing software.

You can do this by running commands in the terminal such as: For C Compiler (typically \`gcc\`): \`\`\` gcc --version \`\`\` For Fortran Compiler (typically \`gfortran\`): \`\`\` gfortran --version \`\`\` If these commands return version information, it means the compilers are installed on your system. If not, you will need to install them. 2. **Add Compilers to the PATH**: If compilers are installed but not recognized by the installation script, it might be because they are not in your system's PATH. You can add them to the PATH by finding out where they are located and updating the PATH environment variable accordingly. - Find out where the compilers are located (if you have installed them): \`\`\` which gcc which gfortran \`\`\` - Add their directories to the PATH. If for example, \`gcc\` and \`gfortran\` are located in \`/usr/bin/\`, you can add them to the PATH by running (in bash shell): \`\`\`bash export PATH=PATH:/usr/bin/ \`\`\` You might need to add this line to your \`.bashrc\` or \`.bash_profile\` (or the equivalent for your shell) to make the change permanent: \`\`\`bash echo 'export PATH=PATH:/usr/bin/' >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc \`\`\` 3. **Verify PATH Update**: After updating the PATH, you can verify that the system recognizes the compilers by running: \`\`\` echo PATH \`\`\` This command should show the paths you've added. 4. **Rerun the Configuration Script**: With the compilers in your PATH, rerun the \`configure\` script (or equivalent initial setup script) for your installation. The script should now be able to locate the compilers. By ensuring that the Fortran and C compilers are both installed and present in the PATH, you should overcome this installation hurdle. If the problem persists, double-check your environment, consider opening a new terminal session to make sure all changes are applied, and ensure there are no typos or other errors in your updates to the PATH variable."},{"instruction":"which gcc /usr/bin/gcc where is this in windows 10 im strugging to find it","output":"In Windows 10, GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) does not come pre-installed. Typically, if you want to use GCC on Windows, you have a few options, some popular ones include: 1. **MinGW:** MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows), allows you to install a variant of GCC. This provides a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications. 2. **Cygwin:** Cygwin is a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows. 3. **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** WSL allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the overhead of a virtual machine. You can install Linux distributions via the Microsoft Store and then use the system's package manager to install GCC. 4. **MSYS2:** MSYS2 is a software distro and building platform for Windows based on MinGW. 5. **TDM-GCC:** A customizable distribution of the GCC compiler for Windows. If you have installed GCC using any of the above methods or a similar approach, your \`gcc\` executable would not be located at \`/usr/bin/gcc\` like in Unix-like systems, because Windows uses a different filesystem structure. Instead, it would be in a directory specific to the installation method. For example: - For MinGW, it might be in \`C:MinGWbin\`. - For Cygwin, it could be in \`C:cygwin64bin\`. - For WSL, you would use the Linux terminal and it behaves like a Linux environment, so you would find \`gcc\` in \`/usr/bin/\`. - For MSYS2, it might be in the installation directory such as \`C:msys64mingw64bin\`. If you're struggling to find where \`gcc\` is installed on your Windows 10 environment, you can search for \`gcc.exe\` using File Explorer or use the command prompt or PowerShell to search for it. Here's a quick way to search for \`gcc.exe\` using the command prompt: 1. Open the Command Prompt. 2. Type the following command and press Enter: \`\`\` where gcc \`\`\` This will search your \`PATH\` environment variable for \`gcc.exe\` and if found, it will display the path(s). Please make sure you have added the directory containing \`gcc\` to your \`PATH\` environment variable to be able to execute it from any command prompt or terminal window. If \`gcc\` was installed correctly, the installer or setup instructions likely suggested you add its directory to your \`PATH\`."},{"instruction":"For WSL, you would use the Linux terminal and it behaves like a Linux environment, so you would find gcc in /usr/bin/. yes but i need to put it in environment variables but how can i do that if i cant see it","output":"If you're using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the environment is segregated from Windows itself, meaning that the Linux file system is not directly exposed to Windows in a way that traditional Windows applications (including the system environment variables) can interact with. Here's what you can do if you need to call GCC from Windows (CMD or PowerShell) using WSL: 1. **Calling WSL Directly:** You can run GCC by invoking WSL directly from CMD or PowerShell, using the \`wsl\` command followed by the command you want to run in WSL. For example: \`\`\`bash wsl gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c \`\`\` 2. **WSL Command Shortcut:** You can create a script or batch file in Windows that calls \`wsl gcc\`, effectively creating an alias for \`gcc\` that points inside WSL. For example: Create a file called \`gcc.bat\` and add the following: \`\`\`batch @echo off wsl gcc %* \`\`\` Now, when you call \`gcc\` from CMD or PowerShell, this batch file will be invoked, passing all the arguments (\`%*\`) to the GCC inside of WSL. 3. **Accessing Linux Files from Windows (Not Recommended for Executables):** With WSL 2, you can access Linux files from Windows through the \`wsl\` network share. However, due to potential file system and permission differences, you should not directly modify Linux files with Windows applications, nor should you try to run Linux binaries directly from Windows outside of WSL. Remember that any binaries compiled in WSL are Linux executables and will not run natively on Windows. These need to be executed within WSL or on a Linux machine. Finally, if you need to integrate GCC with an IDE running on Windows (such as Visual Studio Code), you can configure the IDE to run build tasks within WSL. This allows you to work in the Windows environment while compiling using the Linux environment provided by WSL. If you need a Windows-native GCC compiler for use directly in Windows CMD/PowerShell/Environment, you would need to install MinGW or another Windows-native GCC distribution as I've mentioned before, and place those binaries into your Windows \`PATH\`."},{"instruction":"no this is ubuntu , im having serious issues installing quantum espresso , i just need to get it to compile without errors and since the files werent in my environment variables i'm trying to fix it .","output":"Okay, since your intention is to compile Quantum ESPRESSO inside the Ubuntu environment provided by WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you don't need to worry about the Windows environment variables at all. You need to ensure that the compilation tools are correctly installed and configured within your Ubuntu environment. Before proceeding with the installation and compilation of Quantum ESPRESSO, make sure you have the necessary development tools installed. Here's a general approach on how to prepare for building Quantum ESPRESSO within Ubuntu on WSL: 1. **Update Your Ubuntu Distribution:** Open your WSL terminal (Ubuntu) and run the following commands to make sure your package lists and installed packages are up to date: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade \`\`\` 2. **Install GCC and Other Necessary Development Tools:** To compile Quantum ESPRESSO, you will need a Fortran compiler, a C compiler, and likely other development tools. You can install them as follows: \`\`\`bash sudo apt install build-essential gfortran libopenmpi-dev \`\`\` This installs the GCC C and GFortran compilers, as well as the open-source implementation of the MPI (Message Passing Interface) which is often used by Quantum ESPRESSO. 3. **Set Environment Variables (if necessary):** Normally, the installation process for packages via \`apt\` manages environment variables for you, but if you need to tweak anything or add custom paths, you can set environment variables per session, or you can set them permanently by adding them to your \`~/.bashrc\` file: \`\`\`bash export VARIABLE_NAME=value \`\`\` To make these environment variables persistent across sessions, append the export line to your \`~/.bashrc\` (or \`~/.profile\`, or \`~/.bash_profile\` - depending on the specific shell you are using). 4. **Obtain Quantum ESPRESSO Sources:** Download the Quantum ESPRESSO source code from their official website or GitHub (whichever is recommended). You'll typically end up with a \`.tar.gz\` archive. 5. **Unpack and Compile Quantum ESPRESSO:** Extract the downloaded source code and then follow the instructions provided in the \`README\` or \`INSTALL\` file. Usually, the steps are: \`\`\`bash tar -xf qe-*.tar.gz cd qe-*/ ./configure make all \`\`\` Be sure to consult the official Quantum ESPRESSO documentation for any specific instructions or additional dependencies.

As we dove into Act III, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's Hamlet, I encountered not only the complexity of the language but also the depth of emotion required for the role. The famous \\"To be or not to be\\" soliloquy has always been a daunting mountain to climb for an actor, and I found myself standing at the base, looking up. **Preparation** I started my day with a vigorous workout, aiming to clear my mind and ready my body for the physicality of the role. After some vocal warm-ups, I spent time deeply analyzing the text. Each word Shakespeare chose carries such weight, and I wanted to ensure I understood Hamlet's internal struggle—to exist or not, to fight against a sea of troubles or to end them, to suffer the slings and arrows or take arms against them. I researched various interpretations, watching different actors perform the soliloquy, noticing how their choices influenced the rhythm and meaning. I was particularly struck by how the personal anguish of each Hamlet colored the piece, demonstrating the universal yet personal nature of this existential query. **Rehearsal** Upon arriving at rehearsal, our director, Maria, challenged us to connect with the character's raw humanity. She asked us to tap into our own experiences of doubt and despair, to bring authenticity to our delivery. My scene partner, who plays Ophelia, was a poignant reflection of innocence and concern, adding to the emotional complexity of the scene. During the rehearsal, I experimented with different emotional entry points for Hamlet. I tried a rendition where the words were propelled by pure anger and frustration, and another where they were shaded with deep sorrow and resignation. Each approach offered different insights into Hamlet's psyche. One particular challenge today was to not to get lost in the language, to not just recite the words but to live them, to feel each question and declaration as if conjured on the spot. I struggled with this, especially when trying to balance the intellectual and emotional aspects of the character. At times, I found myself disconnected from the emotions, reciting from my head rather than my heart. **Reflections and Anticipations** Reflecting on today's work, I sense a growing connection with Hamlet. Despite the centuries separating us, his angst, uncertainty, and search for meaning feel incredibly modern and relatable. The nuances of his contemplation need further exploration, and I anticipate digging deeper into the character's psyche and motives in our next session. Perhaps my primary takeaway is that the journey to understanding Hamlet is much like the character's own journey — questioning, fraught with emotional swings, and ultimately enlightening. The rehearsal was a stark reminder that in drama, vulnerability is power. Letting down my guard, allowing the character to seep into my being, is both the challenge and the thrill. I aim to spend time before our next rehearsal exploring the physicality of Hamlet's distress more, perhaps through improvisational exercises that allow his emotions to manifest through movement. I'm also intrigued by the idea of writing a letter as Hamlet to his father or to Ophelia, which might develop my personal connection to the character and intensify my emotional investment. As today's session closes, I feel exhausted but invigorated. There is so much more to uncover, and I eagerly anticipate the journey ahead. Hamlet may question the worth of enduring life's hardships, but for me, the opportunity to explore such rich complexity is unquestionably a gift—one I will cherish and nurture in the weeks to come. **Next Steps** - Continue textual analysis and explore subtext for deeper understanding. - Work on finding the balance between emotion and intellect in delivery. - Develop a physical routine to embody Hamlet's conflict. - Write character letters to explore relationships and inner thoughts. - Discuss with director and scene partner possible interpretations and character dynamics. Until tomorrow, [Your Name]"},{"instruction":"In this drama reflective journey you should answer those questions","output":"Certainly, let's take the journey of the drama reflective journal from the previous text and answer the specific questions you provided earlier in the context of that journey: **1. What have I learned from this experience?** Through today's rehearsal and deep engagement with Hamlet's \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy, I learned the importance of connecting not just intellectually with the character, but emotionally. The need to embody the existential struggle Hamlet faces taught me that each word must be more than recited; it must be lived and felt. I also learned that vulnerability is a powerful tool in drama, and that by tapping into my own experiences of doubt and despair, I can bring authenticity to the character. **2. How do I feel about what transpired?** I feel a mix of exhaustion and excitement. Tackling Shakespeare's complex language and Hamlet's multifaceted character is both draining and invigorating. I am also somewhat frustrated by my own limitations in fully realizing the character's depth. However, the challenge itself is stirring, and I am motivated by the progress I sense, even if it's incremental. **3. What could I have done differently?** I could have prepared with a greater focus on the emotional journey of Hamlet rather than getting overly caught up in the cerebral aspect of his soliloquy. I might have benefited from starting with improvisational exercises that focused on the character's feelings to help ground my performance before delving into the text. Additionally, interacting more with my scene partner could have given me fresh perspectives and insights into Hamlet's nuances. **4. What are my strengths and weaknesses in this situation?** My strength lies in my dedication to understanding and analyzing the text, delving into different interpretations, and bringing a reflective and methodical approach to my preparation. My weakness, however, seems to be in allowing myself to become vulnerable and to fully immerse myself in the raw emotions needed for the role - getting the balance right between thought and feeling. **5. How does this align with my values and goals?** This process aligns with my goals of becoming a more versatile and empathetic actor who can take on complex roles and deliver performances that resonate on a deeply human level. It also aligns with my value of committing fully to the artistic process, embracing the rigor of rehearsal, and the quest for genuine connection with a character and the audience. **6. What patterns am I noticing in my behavior or reactions?** I notice that I tend to gravitate toward intellectualizing the role and holding back emotionally until I feel I've mastered the academic aspect of the character. This pattern can hinder my initial performances, where a more instinctual and emotive response might unveil more truthful aspects of the character. **7. What do I want to change or achieve moving forward?** Moving forward, I want to achieve a deeper harmonic convergence of intellect and emotion in my portrayal of Hamlet. I aim to change my approach by starting with emotional and physical engagement and then layering in the intellectual aspects, rather than the reverse. Additionally, I aim to be more open to the process and to embrace the vulnerabilities that come with stepping into another's existence, fictional or not. My goal is to deliver a Hamlet that speaks to the hearts of the audience as much as their minds. In conclusion, this reflective journey through Hamlet's soliloquy has offered invaluable insights into both the character and myself as an actor. It bolsters my belief that each role undertaken is an opportunity for growth, and while the path may be strewn with challenges, they ultimately serve to enrich my craft."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to change my Android location to Ukraine","output":"To change your Android device's location to Ukraine, you can enable a VPN service with servers in Ukraine or use location spoofing apps, which can trick your phone into thinking you're in another location. Here's how to do it: # Using a VPN: 1. **Download a VPN app**: Choose a reputable VPN service that has servers in Ukraine. Some popular choices include NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and CyberGhost. 2. **Install the VPN app**: Go to the Google Play Store, download, and install the chosen VPN app on your Android device. 3. **Connect to a Ukrainian server**: Open the VPN app, sign in, and connect to a server located in Ukraine. 4. **Verify your new IP location**: You can check if your IP address has been changed successfully to Ukraine by visiting a website like whatismyipaddress.com. 5. **Use apps as normal**: Your traffic will now appear to be coming from Ukraine, and location-based services should recognize your location as Ukraine. # Using a Location Spoofing App: These apps can be used for purposes such as playing location-based games like Pokémon GO, but be aware that many apps and services can detect and block spoofed locations. 1. **Enable Developer Options**: Go to Settings > About phone and tap on “Build number” seven times to enable Developer Options. 2. **Download a GPS Spoofing App**: Get a location spoofing app like Fake GPS Location, GPS Emulator, or Fake GPS Go from the Google Play Store. 3. **Enable Mock Locations**: Go to Settings > System > Developer Options and tap “Select mock location app,” then choose the spoofing app you've installed. 4. **Set your location to Ukraine**: Open the spoofing app and navigate the map to Ukraine. Set your desired location and hit the “Play” or “Start” button to enable the spoof. 5. **Verify the spoofed location**: Open a map application such as Google Maps to ensure that your location is now showing as Ukraine. **A Few Important Notes**: - Using a VPN will change your IP address, which is often enough for services that determine your location based on IP. - Location spoofing apps directly alter the GPS location data on your device, which may affect all location services on the device. - Be cautious when using spoofing apps, as they can violate terms of service for certain apps and can result in bans or suspensions. - Different Android phones may have slightly different settings or steps to access Developer Options. - Use these tools responsibly and be aware of local laws regarding VPNs and location spoofing."},{"instruction":"Write a drama reflective journal.There are some subtitles for this drama reflective journal.They are Dialogue(The two-person speaking task)、beats and storyboard practice、The script writing（This one should include these questions 1.What went well 2.What went badly 3.What were the problems I faced 4.What was good about your team's teamwork 5.What should you do differently in the future.）、Reflective questions（Reflection Questions 1.

Our objective was to deliver a dialogue that conveyed a complex range of emotions. As Alex and I rehearsed, we each found unique ways to interpret our characters' motivations. The exchange of perspectives brought depth to our characters and the scene unfolded organically, which was a powerful learning experience. We learned that dialogue isn't just about words; it's also about the silences and the unsaid. By truly listening to each other, our performance became a dynamic dance of give and take. **Beats and Storyboard Practice** Working on beats and storyboard practice, we dissected each scene into smaller, manageable beats, identifying the key moments that required special attention. This process helped us understand the pace and rhythm of the script. By creating storyboards, we visualized the action, which offered new insights into how the characters move and interact within the space. This step transformed our understanding of physicality in drama and emphasized the importance of visual elements in storytelling. **Script Writing** *What went well*: Our team had a coherent vision, which allowed us to write with a unified voice. The dialogue flowed naturally, and the characters developed strong, distinctive voices that served the story well. *What went badly*: We encountered creative differences, which slowed our progress initially. Some scenes were rewritten multiple times, leading to frustration among team members. *Problems faced*: The main issue was reconciling different ideas for the direction of the plot. Finding a balance between drama and believability was also challenging. *Teamwork*: The strength of our teamwork lay in our dedication and commitment to the project. Even during disputes, we respected each other's opinions and worked towards a compromise. *Differently in the future*: In future projects, I believe setting clear roles and responsibilities from the beginning could avoid confusion and streamline the writing process. **Reflective Questions** 1. Our group seems to be on pace, though there have been times when we've veered off-schedule due to extended discussions. 2. Focus varied between sessions. At times, external distractions, like noise from other groups, diverted our attention. However, most distractions were internal, stemming from disagreements within the group. 3. Storyboarding and character development were completed efficiently, perhaps due to their more visual and imaginative nature. Script revisions, on the other hand, felt inefficient due to the iterative nature of the task. 4. We are somewhat organized, though decision-making sometimes became a lengthy process. Not all members always agreed, causing delays. 5. Looking back, I feel stronger pre-planning and establishing ground rules for decision-making could have been beneficial to stay on track. 6. Workload division was a challenge, with some members taking on more than others. To ensure fairness, clearer task assignments and regular check-ins would improve balance. *Everyone's tasks (as outlined in our production logbook):* - Alex: Dialogue development, character background research, storyboarding for scenes 1-3. - Jamie: Scene outlines, storyboarding for scenes 4-6, scheduling. - Taylor: Main character dialogues and monologues, editing and finalizing scenes. - Sam: Supporting character development, script formatting, leading team discussions. - Myself: Scene descriptions, dialogue polishing, conflict resolution, proofreading final script. In conclusion, while the process presented its challenges, particularly in script writing and workload distribution, the team demonstrated resilience and a commitment to the artistic goals of our project. Moving forward, clearer communication and structured planning procedures would enhance our efficiency and the quality of our collaborative creative endeavors."},{"instruction":"Write a drama reflective journal.There are some subtitles for this drama reflective journal.They are Dialogue(The two-person speaking task)、beats and storyboard practice、The script writing（This one should include these questions 1.What went well 2.What went badly 3.What were the problems I faced 4.What was good about your team's teamwork 5.What should you do differently in the future.）、Reflective questions（Reflection Questions 1.

考虑产品的安装方法和使用场景，是否适用于您的具体环境（譬如家庭、办公室或工业场所）。 - 避免过于简化对安装位置的影响，如墙壁材料、门窗密封程度等。 4. **频率范围**： - 查看产品资料或询问厂商，了解该隔音产品在不同频率下的性能曲线。 - 对于高频噪音（人声、电话铃声等），细密吸音材料往往更有效；而针对低频噪音（交通、工业噪声等），则需要密实、质量较重的材料。 5. **个人敏感度和健康状况**： - 考虑目标使用人群的特殊需要，不同人对于噪声的敏感度不一样，一些轻微的噪音对神经敏感或耳鼻疾病患者的干扰可能会更大。 - 对于有特殊健康问题的使用者，可以咨询医疗专业人员的建议，根据病情和生活环境选择合适的隔音方案。 6. **时间因素（白天夜间感受）**： - 根据日间和夜间频繁出现的不同类型的噪音，估计产品的效果。（例如夜间可能对低频噪声更敏感，而日间可能更关注隔绝交谈声等高频噪音。） 7. **综合评估**： - 综合上述因素对比考量，对产品的整体性能作出估计。 - 如果可能的话，可选择小范围试用或获取样品进行初步测试。 需要注意的是，预先评估隔音产品性能永远无法完全替代实际应用和测量所得到的结果。每个空间的声学属性都是独特的，噪音源和接收场所的具体状况对隔音效果影响极大。因此，理想的做法是结合预估与实践，在使用产品后进行现场测试，以获得可靠的隔音效果数据。"},{"instruction":"若没有提供技术规格，也没有足够时间研究的情况下，只靠眼睛手感来呢？","output":"如果没有技术规格，且没有足够时间进行深入研究，仍需依靠直观的观察和手感来判断隔音材料的潜在性能，以下是一些基本的指导准则： 1. **观察材料厚度**： - 通常情况下，隔音材料越厚，它的隔音能力越好，因为更多的材料可以提供更好的吸声和隔声效果。 2. **检查材料密度**： - 密度高的材料（手感较重和紧实）通常在隔绝低频噪音方面效果较好。 - 如果手感轻盈或者容易压缩，则可能在隔声效果上不如高密度材料。 3. **检查材料结构**： - 纹理和结构复杂的表面提供更多的摩擦和声音散射，有助于吸收声音，尤其是高频噪音。 4. **弹性和柔韧性**： - 按压材料并感受其弹性。如果产品可以有效吸收压力而不是立即反弹，那么它可能在吸音方面表现更好。 5. **质地和材质**： - 观察和感觉材料的质地。软质材料（如海绵、泡沫等）适合吸收声音，而更硬的材料适用于反射声音。 6. **边缘和接缝处**： - 注意观察产品的边缘和接缝处。良好的工艺和紧密的接缝可以减少声波通过边缘和接缝进入后方空间的机会。 7. **气味和化学稳定性**： - 闻一下产品是否有刺鼻的化学气味，化学气味可能表示产品的材料和工艺不够环保，且可能影响室内空气质量。 8. **品牌和生产商的声誉**： - 即使在没有技术规格的情况下，知名品牌通常有更严格的质量控制和生产标准，因此可能提供更可靠的产品性能。 虽然上述方法无法精确衡量隔音材料的性能，但它们可以提供一些对产品质量和性能的初步印象。最终的隔音效果还是需要通过实际应用和测试来确认。记住，隔音方案并不是只依赖单一材料，而是多种因素综合作用的结果，包括房间的布局、其他建筑材料的隔音性能和声音的传播途径。"},{"instruction":"对kidney益处最大的supplement或草本提取物是什么？","output":"在考虑对肾脏有益的补充剂或草本提取物时，着重强调的是预防和维持肾脏健康，而不是对已经存在的肾脏疾病进行治疗。对于保持肾脏健康，饮食和生活方式的调整通常是首选。一些补充剂和草本植物可能对肾脏有益，但请记住，任何补充剂或草本疗法都应在医生的建议下使用，特别是肾脏功能受损时，某些补充剂反而可能导致伤害。 以下是一些可能对肾脏健康有益的补充剂和草本提取物： 1. **Omega-3脂肪酸**： -

Hier vormen kinderen met verschillende culturele en religieuze achtergronden de meerderheid. De school staat voor de uitdaging om een leeromgeving te creëren waar iedereen zich thuis voelt. De directie en het lerarenteam van de school hebben erkend dat de traditionele benadering van religieus onderwijs niet langer volstaat in zo'n gemengde omgeving. Om de verschillen in culturele en religieuze beleving te overbruggen, implementeren ze creatieve technieken die aansluiten bij de diverse behoeften van hun leerlingen. Interactieve projecten, bijvoorbeeld, bevorderen de dialoog tussen de leerlingen met verschillende overtuigingen. Zo wordt er een jaarlijkse 'Cultuurdag' georganiseerd waarbij kinderen hun eigen tradities kunnen voorstellen, muziek kunnen delen en gerechten uit hun eigen keuken kunnen presenteren. Deze initiatieven stimuleren niet alleen het respect voor elkaars achtergrond, maar verrijken ook de schoolervaring voor iedereen. Een andere succesvolle innovatie is het gebruik van storytelling in de klas. Verhalen uit verschillende religieuze en morele tradities worden als springplank gebruikt voor discussies over universele waarden zoals eerlijkheid, respect en empathie. Door verhalen die voor alle leerlingen herkenbaar zijn te delen, wordt het gemakkelijker om aansluiting te vinden bij de ethische dimensies van het katholieke geloof zonder anderen uit te sluiten. De school heeft ook aandacht voor individuele spirituele ontwikkeling. Kinderen die de katholieke geloofslessen willen volgen, worden daarin ondersteund, terwijl anderen de keuze hebben om zich te verdiepen in algemene zingeving of filosofische vraagstukken. Dit model van 'keuzevrijheid' bevordert een klimaat van wederzijds begrip en respect. In tijden van globalisering en sociale media is het voor deze Brusselse katholieke school ook cruciaal om mediacompetentie te integreren in het curriculum. De leerlingen leren kritisch om te gaan met de informatiestromen en worden aangemoedigd om de media te gebruiken om positieve boodschappen van coëxistentie te verspreiden. De resultaten van deze aanpak zijn zichtbaar. De schoolgemeenschap floreert door de nadruk op gemeenschappelijke waarden en het omarmen van verschillen. Ouders, leerlingen en leraren spreken van een warme en open sfeer waar iedereen van elkaar leert en groeit. Deze katholieke school bewijst dat, zelfs in een wereld vol verschillen, onderwijs een verenigende kracht kan zijn die bruggen bouwt tussen diverse culturen. Door creativiteit en flexibiliteit voorop te stellen, zorgen zij voor een voorbeeld van hoe scholen een afspiegeling kunnen zijn van een harmonieuze, multiculturele samenleving."},{"instruction":"Schrijf een artikeltje: In een Brusselse katholieke school in de Kanaalzone is het vaak zoeken naar creatieve vormen om te kunnen omgaan met het feit dat de grootste groep leerlingen zich eerder identificeert met een ander groot religieus verhaal. Hoe kunnen we de Joods-christelijke traditie bij hen ter sprake brengen en hoe vieren we onze Katholieke feesten zoals bijvoorbeeld kerstmis? Het vijfde en zesde leerjaar van de Leo XIII-School in Neder-Over-Heembeek werkte in dit verband een kerstmusical over de geboorte van Jezus uit. Het spektakel werd verschillende keren opgevoerd: voor de andere klassen en ook voor de ouders. Ik wil hen hiervoor feliciteren. Het was een geslaagd project om ons verhaal bij hen ter sprake te brengen.","output":"Titel: Brusselse Leo XIII-School omarmt diversiteit met succesvolle kerstmusical Brussel, België - De Leo XIII-School in Neder-Over-Heembeek, gelegen in de cultureel diverse Kanaalzone van Brussel, heeft een inspirerende weg ingeslagen om de Joods-christelijke traditie levend te houden in een gemeenschap waar de meerderheid van de leerlingen zich identificeert met een ander religieus verhaal. Het vijfde en zesde leerjaar namen de uitdaging op zich om de geboorte van Jezus via een kerstmusical tot leven te brengen. Dit initiatief past binnen een bredere missie om de katholieke feesten op een inclusieve manier te vieren en de betekenis ervan toegankelijk te maken voor alle studenten, ongeacht hun persoonlijke geloof of culturele achtergrond. De kerstmusical, die meerdere malen werd opgevoerd voor leerlingen en ouders, bleek een groot succes. Het verhaal van Jezus' geboorte werd op een eigentijdse wijze gepresenteerd, compleet met muziek en toneelspel die aansluiten bij de leefwereld van de kinderen. Dit zorgde voor herkenbaarheid en stimuleerde de interesse en empathie van het jonge publiek. De school benaderde het project met veel aandacht voor dialoog en respect voor de diverse religieuze uitingen die de leerlingen zelf meebrachten. Door de leerlingen actief te betrekken bij de voorbereiding en uitvoering van het spektakel, bevorderde men niet alleen hun begrip van de katholieke traditie, maar ook hun gevoel van eigenaarschap en trots. Het succes van de kerstmusical toont aan dat het mogelijk is om de kernwaarden en verhalen van de katholieke traditie te delen zonder anderen uit te sluiten. De nadruk lag op universele thema's zoals liefde, hoop en gemeenschap, waarden die breed gedeeld worden over verschillende culturen en religies heen. De reacties van zowel de ouders als de andere leerlingen waren overwegend positief. Velen prezen de manier waarop het project werd aangepakt en de respectvolle wijze waarop het verhaal aan de leerlingen werd gepresenteerd. Dit initiatief dient als een prachtig voorbeeld voor andere scholen die streven naar een inclusief onderwijsmodel dat ruimte biedt voor alle leerlingen om hun identiteit te verkennen en tegelijkertijd meer te leren over de culturen en overtuigingen van anderen. De directie en het lerarenkorps van de Leo XIII-School verdienen lof voor hun inzet en creativiteit. Hun aanpak biedt hoop voor een toekomst waarin onderwijs een brugfunctie vervult tussen diverse gemeenschappen. Met projecten als deze kerstmusical lukt het hen om hun leerlingen niet alleen over hun eigen traditie te vertellen, maar ze ook te inspireren om met respect en nieuwsgierigheid naar de wereld om hen heen te kijken. Het project toont aan dat, zelfs in onze complexe en veelzijdige samenleving, gemeenschappelijke vieringen mogelijk zijn, die zowel verbinden als verrijken."},{"instruction":"Schrijf een artikeltje: Op donderdag 28 december kwam de inspecteur van de verzekering langs in de Heilig Hart- en Sint-Lambertuskerk om de toestand van de kerk die getreiterd wordt door steenval en glasbraak te analyseren en om te beslissen welke elementen van de schade door de brandverzekering gedekt zijn. De pastoor had het dossier grondig en schriftelijk voorbereid. Hij schetste de historiek van de schade en legde de inspecteur reeds verschillende offertes voor van noodzakelijk uit te voeren werken. Ter ondersteuning waren onze makelaar en de penningmeester van de Instelling ook aanwezig.","output":"Titel: Verzekeringsinspecteur evalueert schade aan Heilig Hart- en Sint-Lambertuskerk Op een grijze donderdag, de 28e december, werd de stilte van de Heilig Hart- en Sint-Lambertuskerk doorbroken door een bijzonder bezoek. Een inspecteur van de verzekering was ter plaatse gekomen om de recente problemen van steenval en glasbraak onder de loep te nemen. Deze kwesties hebben de gemeenschap grote zorgen gebaard, aangezien ze de veiligheid van de kerkgangers in het gedrang brengen en de esthetische waarde van het historische gebouw aantasten. De pastoor van de kerk had de ontmoeting zorgvuldig voorbereid. Hij stelde een uitgebreid en gedetailleerd dossier samen waarin de geschiedenis van de schade chronologisch werd beschreven. Zijn grondige schriftelijke verslaglegging bood de inspecteur een helder inzicht in de complexiteit van de situatie en stelde hem in staat om een gefundeerde beslissing te nemen. Bovendien had de pastoor de proactiviteit getoond om alvast diverse offertes van aannemers die de noodzakelijke reparaties konden uitvoeren, te verzamelen. Dit zou een vlotte aanvang van de reparatiewerken mogelijk maken, mocht de schade door de brandverzekering gedekt blijken te zijn. Essentieel bij deze beoordeling waren ook de aanwezigheid en expertise van de verzekeringsmakelaar, die als tussenpersoon handelt tussen de kerk en de verzekeringsmaatschappij, en de penningmeester van de Instelling. Hun inbreng was van grote waarde, aangezien zij samen met de pastoor de financiële en administratieve aspecten van de schade en de nodige herstelwerkzaamheden konden toelichten. De uitkomst van dit evaluatiebezoek is van cruciaal belang voor de Heilig Hart- en Sint-Lambertuskerk, aangezien het de weg zal effenen voor de herstellingswerkzaamheden die nodig zijn om de kerk in haar oude glorie te herstellen en toekomstige incidenten te voorkomen. De gemeenschap wacht in spanning op de beslissing van de inspecteur, hopend dat de verzekering de financies zal bieden om hun geliefde kerk te beschermen en veilig te stellen voor de vele generaties die nog komen. Dit voorval benadrukt het belang van adequaat verzekeringsbeleid en preventief onderhoud voor historische gebouwen, vooral degenen die een actieve rol spelen in het sociaal-maatschappelijk leven, zoals de Heilig Hart- en Sint-Lambertuskerk dat doet."},{"instruction":"give 100 usa based business listing sites list","output":"Below is a list of 100 USA-based business listing sites where you may list a business for better online presence and potential local SEO benefits.

Spam scores are determined by SEO tools such as Moz and others that analyze a variety of factors and signals to predict how likely it is that a site could be penalized by search engines. These scores are proprietary to the companies that develop the algorithms and are not publicly available without using their services. Since obtaining spam scores would require checking each site individually with an updated SEO tool, I cannot provide you with a list that includes the spam scores for each business listing site. To find the spam score of each business listing website, you or an SEO professional would typically perform the following steps: 1. Sign up for an account with a service like Moz, Ahrefs, SEMrush, or other SEO tool providers that offer spam score checking capabilities. 2. Enter the URLs of the business listing sites you're interested in analyzing into the appropriate tool. 3. Review the spam score that the tool provides for each site. It's important to note that the spam score is just an indicator, not an absolute measure, and it's based on patterns seen in penalized sites and not on any Google-provided data. Additionally, spam scores can change over time, and a high spam score doesn't necessarily mean that a website is harmful or low-quality—it should just prompt further investigation.

어?! ― 오오! 해설들이 깜짝 놀랐다. 경기를 지켜보던 관중들도 눈을 부릅뜨며 비명을 질렀다. 전혀 예상치 못한 신재욱의 움직임 때문이었다. 그리고 지금. 신재욱은 발을 뻗으며 미소를 지었다. ‘된 것 같은데?’ 예상했던 그대로의 상황이 나왔다. 아주 조금의 오차는 있지만, 충분히 컨트롤할 수 있는 정도였다. 스윽! 신재욱이 발끝을 움직였다. 이케르 카시야스의 손끝에 걸리며 튕겨 나오려는 공을 다시 골대 안으로 밀어 넣었다. 퉁! 투웅! 공은 바닥에 두 번 튕기며 레알 마드리드의 골대 안으로 들어갔다. ― 우와아아아아아아! 고오오오오오올! 골입니다! 들어갔습니다! 이게 뭔가요?! 이런 골이 나오네요! ― 우오오오오! 신재욱 선수! 믿을 수 없는 골입니다! 이케르 카시야스의 슈퍼세이브라는 말을 외치려던 때, 신재욱 선수가 그걸 또 골로 연결하네요! 이건 뭐죠? 무슨 움직임이죠? 카시야스 골키퍼의 움직임을 예상이라도 한 걸까요? ― 그… 게 아니라면 설명이 되질 않네요! 신재욱 선수가 이제는 미래를 내다보는 걸까요? 산티아고 베르나베우가 조용해졌다. 관중들 모두 충격을 받은 얼굴이었다. 실시간으로 경기를 지켜보던 전 세계 축구팬들의 반응도 비슷했다. └ ……내가 지금 뭘 본 거지? └ 오우…… 이건 말이 안 되는데……. └ 신재욱은 미래를 볼 수 있는 거야? 어떻게 이런 골을 만들어낼 수가 있지? └ 지금 이케르 카시야스가 막아낼 방향을 예측해서 발을 뻗은 거 맞지? 난 살면서 저렇게 골을 넣는 선수를 본 적이 없어. └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 스트라이커는 마법사야? 매번 하이라이트 영상만 보다가 경기하는 건 오늘 처음 봤는데, 움직임의 수준이 너무 높은데? └ 신재욱은 팬들을 자주 놀라게 하는 선수야. 근데 이번 골은 그중에서도 특별하네. 나 아직도 입이 안 닫혀. └ 이케르 카시야스가 가장 놀라고 있을걸? 저기 카시야스의 표정 좀 봐봐. 이게 현실인지 아닌지도 판단이 안 된다는 표정이잖아. └ 미래를 보는 선수가 있을 줄이야. 하하! 물론 말이 안 되지만, 신재욱이 방금 넣은 골은 미래를 본다고 해도 믿어질 정도였어! └ 난 늘 말하지만, 신재욱은 세계 최고의 스트라이커가 될 남자야. 모두 놀라움을 넘어 믿을 수 없다는 반응이었다. 경기장에 있던 선수들도 눈을 동그랗게 뜬 채, 신재욱을 바라봤다. 그리고 그런 시선이 쏟아지는 가운데. 신재욱은 공을 옆구리에 낀 채, 덤덤한 얼굴로 경기장 중앙을 향해 달렸다. ― 신재욱 선수가 평소처럼 경기장 중앙으로 공을 옮기고 있습니다! 이야…… 모두를 놀라게 한 골을 터트려놓고 이렇게나 덤덤할 수가 있나요? ― 허허……! 신재욱 선수에겐 그렇게 놀라운 일이 아닌 모양입니다. 산티아고 베르나베우의 분위기가 바뀐 것처럼. 양 팀 선수들의 기세도 바뀌었다. 레알 마드리드는 기세가 한풀 꺾인 게 겉으로 드러났고. 바이에른 뮌헨의 선수들은 더욱 기세가 올랐다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 점유율을 높여가고 있습니다! 2 대 0으로 앞서가는 상황이어서 그런지, 선수들의 움직임에서 여유가 느껴지네요. ― 전반전은 바이에른 뮌헨이 완전히 가져가는 분위기입니다. 반면 레알 마드리드 선수들은 신재욱 선수의 골 이후로 위축되어있는 듯한 모습을 보여주고 있네요. ― 정신적으로 큰 충격을 받았을 겁니다. 전반전 내내 과하다는 생각이 들 정도로 신재욱 선수를 경계했거든요? 그런데도 신재욱 선수에게 골을 허용했으니, 흔들리지 않을 수가 없죠. 레알 마드리드는 수비하는 것에 급급했다. 앞으로 나가며 빌드업의 중심이 되어주어야 할 루카 모드리치와 사비 알론소조차 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격을 막아내는 것에 바빴다. 최전방에 있는 크리스티아누 호날두가 답답하다는 듯 소리를 질러봤지만 크게 달라지는 건 없었다. 전반전의 시간이 흘러가는 내내, 바이에른 뮌헨의 분위기였다. ― 오오! 이케르 카시야스의 선방입니다! ― 신재욱 선수의 과감한 슈팅이었습니다! 굉장히 위협적이었는데, 이케르 카시야스 골키퍼가 이걸 막아내네요! ― 이번엔 알라바의 슈팅이었습니다! ― 다비드 알라바 선수도 수비수지만 킥 능력이 굉장히 좋은 선수거든요? 비록 골대를 살짝 벗어났지만, 충분히 슈팅을 시도할 수 있는 상황이었습니다. 좋은 시도였죠! 바이에른 뮌헨은 계속해서 레알 마드리드를 밀어붙였다. 가능하면 전반전에 추가 골을 넣어서 점수 차이를 더욱 벌리려고 했다. 그러나 레알 마드리드는 레알 마드리드였다. 멘탈이 흔들린 상황에서도 집중력을 잃지 않고 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격을 필사적으로 막아냈다. ― 전반전이 종료됩니다. 바이에른 뮌헨에게 좋은 기회가 많았는데, 레알 마드리드가 잘 막아내며 2 대 0에서 추가 실점은 없었습니다. ― 레알 마드리드 선수들의 투지도 대단하네요. 그런데 후반전엔 지금처럼 플레이하면 경기에서 이기는 건 어려울 것 같습니다. 후반전엔 뭔가 다른 모습을 보여줄 필요가 있어 보입니다. 잠시 후. 후반전이 시작됐다. 양 팀 선수들의 구성엔 변화가 없었다. 모두 전반전을 뛰었던 선수들이었다. 이처럼 선수들은 같았지만, 경기력엔 변화가 생긴 팀이 있었다. ― 레알 마드리드의 전술이 조금 바뀐 것 같죠? ― 예. 전반전보다 훨씬 더 공격적으로 바뀌었습니다. 효과도 괜찮은 것 같습니다. 지금 보시면 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 당황하고 있거든요? 공격에 많은 무게를 실은 레알 마드리드는 위협적이었다. 크리스티아누 호날두, 카림 벤제마, 가레스 베일이라는 공격진은 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비진을 긴장시켰다. ― 레알 마드리드 선수들이 전반전이 끝난 이후에 동기부여를 확실히 하고 온 것처럼 보입니다! 전반전과는 완전히 다른 팀이 되었거든요? ― 정말 그러네요! 전반전에 밀리던 레알 마드리드가 아닌 것 같습니다! 이제야 팬들이 원하던 레알 마드리드의 모습을 보여주고 있네요! 당황한 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 잠시 웅크렸다. 날카로운 레알 마드리드의 공격을 막아내기 위해서였다. 신재욱도 지금은 밑으로 내려와서 동료들의 수비를 도왔다. 스트라이커였지만, 그의 수비 가담은 팀에 큰 도움을 주고 있었다. 지금도 그랬다. 휘익! 휙! 탈압박 능력이 워낙 뛰어나서 어지간해선 공을 뺏기지 않는 선수인 루카 모드리치. 그는 공을 소유한 상태로 자신감 있게 전진했다. 토니 크로스가 가까이에 붙은 채로 압박을 하고 있었지만, 루카 모드리치는 너무나도 편안해 보였다. 그런데 이때. 루카 모드리치의 시야 밖에서 은밀하게 접근한 신재욱이 몸을 날렸다. 타이밍이 완벽한 슬라이딩 태클. 제아무리 루카 모드리치라고 해도 보이지 않는 곳에서 갑자기 들어온 태클을 피해내진 못했다. 더구나 신재욱은 공을 먼저 건드렸다. 반칙이 아닌, 정당한 태클이었다. ― 신재욱이 끊어냈습니다! 스트라이커면서 세계 최고 수준의 태클 능력을 지닌 선수다운 플레이입니다! ― 루카 모드리치 선수는 정말 공을 뺏기지 않는 걸로 유명한 선수인데, 신재욱 선수의 태클엔 어쩔 수가 없네요! 이러면 레알 마드리드의 공격 흐름이 완전히 끊겼죠! 신재욱이 몸을 벌떡 일으켰다. 그 순간에 공을 뺏긴 루카 모드리치가 덤벼들었지만, 신재욱은 몸을 빙글 돌리며 탈압박을 해냈다. ― 루카 모드리치를 탈압박해내는 신재욱! 직접 공을 몰고 앞으로 나아갑니다! 신재욱이 공을 끊어냈을 때부터. 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진은 앞으로 튀어 나가고 있었다. 미리 약속된 움직임이기도 했지만, 신재욱을 믿기에 나온 판단이었다. 신재욱이라면 공을 뺏기지 않고 어떻게든 전방으로 연결해줄 거라는 믿음. ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습입니다! 공을 몰고 전진하는 신재욱의 앞을 사비 알론소가 가로막으려고 했다. 이때 신재욱은 속도를 줄이지 않고 몸을 대각선으로 틀었다. 그러자 사비 알론소가 어깨를 부딪쳐왔다. 퍼억! 신재욱은 밀리지 않았다. 사비 알론소와 몸싸움을 하면서도 계속해서 앞으로 나아갔다. 그 순간 신재욱의 시야엔 보였다. 전방에서 공을 받을 준비가 된 이택현의 모습이. 투욱! 신재욱은 이택현을 향해 공을 강하게 차 냈다. 동시에 전방을 향해 전속력으로 달리며 소리쳤다. “다시!” 그 말을 들은 이택현이 오른발의 안쪽으로 공을 툭 밀었다. 달려오는 신재욱의 앞쪽 공간에 밀어준 센스있는 패스였다. ‘좋은 패스야.’ 신재욱은 공에 집중했다. 아주 좋은 슈팅 타이밍이었다. 순간적으로 이택현에게 시선이 쏠린 상황이었기에, 방해도 없었다. 퍼엉! 신재욱이 발등이 공을 때려냈다. 강하게 때리기보다는 제대로 맞추는 것에 집중한 슈팅이었다. 의도는 성공했다. 공은 발등에 제대로 걸렸고, 강하게 차려고 하지 않았음에도 엄청난 속도로 쏘아졌다. 페널티박스 바깥에서 때려낸 슈팅이었는데, 공은 순식간에 레알 마드리드의 골대 안을 파고들었다. 철렁! 그 대단한 이케르 카시야스 골키퍼조차 지금은 반응도 하지 못한 채 제자리에 서 있었다. ― 우와아아아아아! 들어갔습니다! 신재욱 선수의 원더골이 나왔습니다! 정말 환상적인 골이네요! ― 엄청난 슈팅이었습니다! 이케르 카시야스 골키퍼가 움직이지도 못할 정도로 강력한 슈팅이었죠! 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수의 호흡은 정말 경이롭습니다……! ― 신재욱 선수가 산티아고 베르나베우를 다시 한번 침묵하게 합니다! 그 열정적인 레알 마드리드의 팬들이 지금은 응원조차 하지 못하며 허탈해하고 있습니다! ― 양 팀의 스코어는 이제 3 대 0이 됩니다! 치열할 것이라던 전문가들의 예상과는 다르게 바이에른 뮌헨이 3점이나 앞서나갑니다! 해설들의 말처럼 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 침묵했다. 너무 강한 충격을 받은 것일까? 침묵은 공을 든 신재욱이 경기장 중앙에 도착할 때까지 끝나지 않았다. 그리고 신재욱은 덤덤했다. 레알 마드리드를 상대로 2개의 골을 넣었음에도 별것 아니라는 듯한 태도를 보였다. 그런데 지금. 신재욱의 입꼬리가 꿈틀거렸다. 표정에 변화가 생겼다. 골을 넣었기 때문은 아니었다. 허공에 떠오른 몇 개의 메시지 때문이었다. [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] [몸싸움이 1 올랐습니다!] [태클이 1 올랐습니다!] [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] [대인방어가 1 올랐습니다!] “이게 얼마 만이야?”","output":"175 --- The moment Lee Taek-hyun shot the ball. Shin Jaewook anticipated it. 'Could it be blocked?' He thought that Iker Casillas, one of the world's best goalkeepers, might be able to save it. Unless it was a really well-struck shot. 'That shot was too obvious.' There was a sense of disappointment in Lee Taek-hyun's shot. It was a manageable shot that a world-class goalkeeper could easily read. That's why Shin Jaewook moved. 'Given Casillas's position, catching that shot would be tough. He might block it, but it'll probably just graze his fingertips.' Predicting the ball's position that would brush past Iker Casillas's fingertips, Shin Jaewook stretched out his foot. It was half a gamble. It could turn out to be a pointless action. But even if it didn't result in anything, that was okay. 'If it doesn't work out, then it can't be helped.' He thought that there was meaning in just making the attempt. ― Eh? What?! ― Oh! The commentators were taken aback. The spectators watching the game also screamed in surprise, their eyes wide open. It was because of Shin Jaewook's unexpected move. And now. Shin Jaewook smiled as he stretched out his foot. 'Does it look like it worked?' The situation unfolded just as he had anticipated. There was a slight error, but it was within a controllable range. Swoosh! Shin Jaewook moved his foot. He pushed the ball, which was about to bounce off Iker Casillas's fingertips, back into the goal. Thump! Thwoom! The ball bounced twice on the ground and went into Real Madrid's goal. ― Wowwwww! Goooooal! It's a goal! It went in! What is this?! What a goal! ― Woah! Shin Jaewook! An unbelievable goal! Just as we were about to shout about Iker Casillas's super save, Shin Jaewook turns it into a goal! What is this? What kind of move is that? Did he anticipate Casillas's movements? ― If not... it's inexplicable! Is Shin Jaewook now seeing into the future? The Santiago Bernabeu fell silent. The faces of the audience were all in shock. The reaction of soccer fans around the world watching the game in real-time was similar. └ ...What did I just see? └ Wow... this is unbelievable... └ Can Shin Jaewook see the future? How can he score such a goal? └ Did he just predict the direction Iker Casillas would save and stretched out his foot? I've never seen a player score a goal like that in my life. └ Is Bayern Munich's striker a wizard? I've only ever watched highlight videos, but seeing him play today for the first time, his movements are just too high-level? └ Shin Jaewook always surprises the fans. But this goal is special among them. My mouth is still open. └ Iker Casillas must be the most surprised, right? Look at Casillas's expression. He looks like he can't even tell if this is reality or not. └ To think there's a player who can see the future. Haha! Of course, it's nonsense, but the goal Shin Jaewook just scored makes you believe he could see the future! └ I always say, Shin Jaewook is the man who will become the world's best striker. The reactions were beyond surprise; they were of disbelief. The players at the stadium also looked at Shin Jaewook with wide eyes. Amidst such attention. Shin Jaewook, with the ball tucked under his side, ran towards the center of the field with a calm face. ― Shin Jaewook is moving the ball to the center of the field as usual! Wow... how can he be so calm after scoring such a surprising goal? ― Haha...! It seems like it's not such a surprising event for Shin Jaewook. As if the atmosphere of Santiago Bernabeu had changed. The momentum of the players from both teams changed as well. Real Madrid's momentum visibly waned. The Bayern Munich players were more spirited. ― Bayern Munich is increasing their possession! Maybe because they're leading 2-0, you can feel the ease in the players' movements. ― The first half is completely dominated by Bayern Munich. On the other hand, Real Madrid players seem to be intimidated after Shin Jaewook's goal. ― They must have been mentally shocked. They were overly cautious of Shin Jaewook throughout the first half, right? But still, they conceded a goal to Shin Jaewook, so they can't help but be shaken. Real Madrid was busy defending. Even Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso, who should have been central to the build-up, were busy fending off Bayern Munich's attacks. Cristiano Ronaldo, at the front, shouted in frustration, but nothing much changed. Throughout the first half, the atmosphere was in favor of Bayern Munich. ― Oh! It's a save by Iker Casillas! ― It was a bold shot by Shin Jaewook! It was very threatening, but goalkeeper Iker Casillas managed to save it! ― This time it's a shot by Alaba! ― David Alaba, although a defender, has a very good kicking ability, right? Although it slightly missed the goal, it was a situation where he could attempt a shot. It was a good try! Bayern Munich kept pushing Real Madrid. They tried to score an additional goal in the first half to widen the score gap. But Real Madrid was still Real Madrid. Even with their mentality shaken, they did not lose focus and desperately blocked Bayern Munich's attacks. ― The first half ends. Bayern Munich had many good opportunities, but Real Madrid managed to hold them off without conceding any more goals after the 2-0. ― The fighting spirit of the Real Madrid players is impressive. But if they play like this in the second half, it will be difficult to win the game. They need to show something different in the second half. After a while. The second half began. There were no changes in the composition of the players from both teams. They were all players who had played in the first half. While the players were the same, there was a team that had undergone a change in performance. ― Real Madrid's tactics seem to have changed a bit, right? ― Yes. It's much more offensive than in the first half. It seems to be working well. If you look now, the Bayern Munich players are flustered, aren't they? Real Madrid, with a heavier emphasis on attack, was threatening. The attacking trio of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and Gareth Bale put pressure on Bayern Munich's defense. ― Real Madrid players seem to have come back with solid motivation after the end of the first half! It's a completely different team from the first half, isn't it? ― Really! Real Madrid, which was being pushed back in the first half, doesn't seem the same! Now they're showing the performance the fans wanted to see! The flustered Bayern Munich players hunkered down for a moment. It was to block the sharp attacks of Real Madrid. Shin Jaewook, although a striker, was also helping his teammates defend. His involvement in defense was a great help to the team. It was the same now. Whisk! Whisk! Luka Modric, a player with exceptional ability to resist being dispossessed, confidently advanced with the ball. Toni Kroos was close by, applying pressure, but Luka Modric looked too comfortable. But then. Shin Jaewook, who had stealthily approached from outside Modric's field of vision, threw himself into a sliding tackle. The timing was perfect. Even Luka Modric couldn't avoid a tackle that came out of nowhere so suddenly. Moreover, Shin Jaewook touched the ball first. It wasn't a foul, but a legitimate tackle. ― Shin Jaewook cuts it off! A play worthy of a striker with one of the world's best tackling abilities! ― Luka Modric is famous for not losing the ball, but there's nothing he can do about Shin Jaewook's tackle! This completely cuts off Real Madrid's attacking flow! Shin Jaewook got up briskly. At that moment, Luka Modric, who had lost the ball, lunged at him, but Shin Jaewook spun around, evading the pressure. ― Shin Jaewook evades Luka Modric! He takes the ball and moves forward himself! From the moment Shin Jaewook intercepted the ball. Bayern Munich's attackers had been sprinting forward. It was a pre-arranged movement, but it was also a decision made out of trust in Shin Jaewook. They believed that Shin Jaewook would not lose the ball and would somehow connect it to the front. ― It's a counterattack by Bayern Munich! As Shin Jaewook advanced with the ball, Xabi Alonso tried to block him. At that moment, Shin Jaewook didn't slow down but twisted his body diagonally. Then Xabi Alonso bumped into him with his shoulder. Thud! Shin Jaewook didn't budge. He continued to move forward while engaging in a physical battle with Xabi Alonso. At that moment, Shin Jaewook saw it. The sight of Lee Taek-hyun, ready to receive the ball up front. Thwock! Shin Jaewook kicked the ball hard towards Lee Taek-hyun. At the same time, he sprinted forward at full speed, shouting. \\"Back!\\" Hearing that, Lee Taek-hyun nudged the ball with the inside of his right foot. It was a sensible pass that pushed the ball into the space ahead of the sprinting Shin Jaewook. 'Good pass.' Shin Jaewook focused on the ball. It was a perfect timing for a shot. Since the attention was momentarily on Lee Taek-hyun, there was no interference. Bang! Shin Jaewook struck the ball with his instep. The shot was focused on hitting the ball correctly rather than on power. The intention was successful. The ball was hit squarely by the instep, and despite not trying to hit it hard, it shot out at tremendous speed. It was a shot from outside the penalty box, but the ball quickly penetrated Real Madrid's goal. Clang! Even the great Iker Casillas, the goalkeeper, stood still, unable to react. ― Wowwwww! It's in! Shin Jaewook scores a wonder goal! What a fantastic goal! ― An incredible shot! It was so powerful that even goalkeeper Iker Casillas couldn't move! The coordination between Shin Jaewook and Lee Taek-hyun is truly miraculous...! ― Shin Jaewook silences the Santiago Bernabeu once again! Those passionate Real Madrid fans are now too stunned to even cheer! ― The score between the two teams is now 3-0! Contrary to the experts' predictions of a fierce match, Bayern Munich is leading by three points! As the commentators said, Real Madrid's fans were silent. Was it too much of a shock? The silence did not end until Shin Jaewook reached the center of the field with the ball. And Shin Jaewook was calm. Even after scoring two goals against Real Madrid, he acted as if it was nothing special. But now. The corners of Shin Jaewook's mouth twitched. There was a change in his expression. It wasn't because he had scored a goal. It was because of several messages that had appeared in the air. [Agility has increased by 1!] [Physical Battle has increased by 1!] [Tackling has increased by 1!] [Stamina has increased by 1!] [Man-to-Man Defense has increased by 1!] \\"How long has it been?\\""},{"instruction":"177 * * * 고작 전반 20분밖에 안 됐지만. 경기의 분위기는 완전히 레알 마드리드 측으로 넘어갔다. 짧은 시간에 터진 2개의 골 때문이었다. ― 역시 레알 마드리드는 레알 마드리드네요! 1차전에서 그렇게 밀렸던 팀 맞습니까? 2차전에선 완전히 다른 모습을 보여주고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로 벌써 2 대 0입니다! 다른 팀도 아니고 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로요! ― 정말 놀랍습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨이 이렇게 밀리는 건 정말 보기 힘들거든요? 리그에서도 이렇게 밀렸던 경기가 없지 않습니까? ― 적어도 이번 시즌엔 없다고 봐도 되죠! 거의 모든 경기에서 압도했으면 했지, 밀리진 않았었거든요! 그런데 그런 바이에른 뮌헨이 챔피언스리그 4강 2차전에선 굉장히 힘든 경기를 치르고 있습니다! 모두가 예상하지 못했던 상황이었고. 실시간으로 경기를 지켜보던 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 흥분을 가라앉히지 못하고 있었다. └ 으하하하! 이게 레알 마드리드다!!!!!!! 바이에른 뮌헨은 1차전에 운이 좋았을 뿐이야! 오늘의 레알 마드리드가 진짜라고! └ 봤지? 다들 봤지? 이게 레알 마드리드의 실력이야! 레알 마드리드는 세계 최고의 팀이라고! └ 세르히오 라모스가 왜 세계 최고의 수비수인지 알겠냐? 얜 공격수보다도 골을 더 잘 넣거든! └ 큭큭! 라모스가 바이에른 뮌헨을 부숴버리고 있어! 오늘 레알 마드리드 너무 잘하는데? └ 챔피언스리그 결승엔 레알 마드리드가 진출하겠군! └ 그 바이에른 뮌헨도 레알 마드리드 앞에선 어쩔 수 없구나! └ 레알 마드리드가 1차전에서의 복수를 하기 시작했군! └ 세르히오 라모스의 헤더는 알고도 막기 어렵지! 같은 시각. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 당황하고 있었다. 전반전 20분 만에 2개의 실점을 허용하게 됐다는 사실에 평정심을 유지하지 못했다. 그런데 이들은 억지로라도 평정심을 되찾기 위해 노력했다. 현재의 팀 상황을 파악한 채로 보완할 점을 알려주는 신재욱 덕이었다. ― 신재욱 선수가 동료들에게 무언가를 열심히 말하고 있네요? ― 자주 있는 일은 아니지만, 팀의 분위기가 좋지 않을 때마다 신재욱 선수는 지금처럼 동료들에게 많은 이야기를 해주는 편이죠. 그리고 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 신재욱 선수의 말을 굉장히 잘 듣는 편이라고 합니다. 팀에서 가장 어린 선수였지만, 가장 많은 골을 넣는 선수. 더구나 경험이 가장 적으면서 가장 베테랑처럼 축구 하는 선수. 그런 신재욱의 말이었기에 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 집중력을 끌어올릴 수 있었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 빠르게 안정감을 되찾고 있는 것처럼 보이죠? ― 정말 그렇네요. 분명 선수들이 당황한 것처럼 보였었는데 말이죠? 신재욱 선수의 말들이 효과가 있었던 걸까요? 레알 마드리드는 계속해서 바이에른 뮌헨을 몰아붙였다. 초반부터 잡은 기세를 놓치지 않겠다는 듯, 공격을 멈추지 않았다. 바쁘게 몰아치는 공격이었음에도 날카로움이 그대로 담겨 있었다. 그런데 바이에른 뮌헨이 잘 버텨냈다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비가 좋은데요? 선수들이 흔들리지 않습니다! 초반에 2골을 허용했을 때와는 경기력이 달라진 것 같습니다! ― 이게 바이에른 뮌헨이죠! 이제야 진짜 바이에른 뮌헨답네요! 분데스리가에서 보여주던 단단한 수비를 보여주며 레알 마드리드의 공격을 효과적으로 방어했다. 게다가 이제는 날카로운 역습까지 시도했다. 투웅! 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거가 필립 람에게 공을 넘겼고. 필립 람은 부드럽게 공을 컨트롤한 뒤, 좋은 위치에 있던 토마스 뮐러에게 패스를 보냈다. 이때 토마스 뮐러는 공을 끌지 않았다. 욕심을 부리지 않고, 오늘은 공격형 미드필더로 출전한 이택현에게 공을 넘겼다. ― 이택현 선수가 공을 받습니다! 오늘 누구도 예상하지 못한 공격형 미드필더로 출전을 한 이택현 선수인데, 아직까진 무언가를 보여줄 기회가 없었거든요? 하지만 이제는 기회가 온 것 같습니다! 명장인 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 이택현 선수를 공격형 미드필더로 투입한 이유를 보여주면 좋겠네요! 이때 이택현은 모두를 놀라게 할 플레이를 보여줬다. ― 이택현 선수! 과감합니다! 과감한 패스를 찔러넣습니다! 토마스 뮐러에게서 공을 받자마자 시도한 스루패스. 뻗어져 나간 공엔 날이 제대로 서 있었다. 워낙 빠른 타이밍에 나온 패스였고, 정확도도 완벽에 가까웠다. 공은 단숨에 신재욱의 발 앞에 도착했다. ― 어느새 페널티박스 안으로 침투한 신재욱 선수가 공을 잡았습니다! 너무 좋은 기회죠! 상대의 페널티박스 안에서 안정적으로 공을 받은 상황. 더구나 다리를 휘둘러 슈팅할 타이밍도 충분히 나왔다. 휘익! 신재욱이 다리를 휘둘렀다. 골키퍼가 막기 어려운 상단 구석을 노린 슈팅이었다. ― 고오오오오올! 골입니다! 드디어 바이에른 뮌헨의 골이 터졌습니다! ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 패스 플레이가 너무 좋았네요! 특히 마지막에 이택현 선수의 킬패스는 정말 날카로웠습니다! ― 이택현 선수가 공격형 미드필더로서도 재능이 있었군요? 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 이런 중요한 경기에서 이택현 선수를 공격형 미드필더로 출전시킨 이유가 있었습니다! 이택현 선수, 패스의 타이밍과 정교함이 대단합니다! ― 신재욱 선수의 퍼스트 터치와 슈팅도 완벽했습니다! 골을 넣은 신재욱은 좋은 패스를 준 이택현에게 엄지를 들어 올리며 고마운 마음을 드러냈다. “택현아, 패스 좋더라. 덕분에 편하게 골 넣을 수 있었어.” “흐흐! 타이밍이 예술이었지? 그 타이밍에 패스하면 네가 바로 골 넣어줄 거 같았어. 하! 이거 이러다가 평생 공격형 미드필더로만 나오게 되는 거 아니야? 난 윙어로 뛰는 걸 더 좋아하는데…….” “자만하진 말고, 전반전이 끝나기 전까지 한 골 더 만들어보자.” “좋아! 완전히 달콤한 패스로 줄 테니까 기대해! 재욱아 내가 완벽하게 만들어줄 테니까 넌 그냥 골을 잘 넣기만 해줘.” “골 넣는 건 내 전문이지.” “좀 재수 없지만 맞는 말이긴 해. 분데스리가 득점왕이니까.” 신재욱은 이택현과의 대화를 마친 뒤, 다른 동료들과도 짧은 대화를 나눴다. 이어서 그는 관중석에 가득한 팬들을 바라보며 함성을 유도했다. ― 팬들의 함성이 굉장합니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 홈구장답네요! 홈팬들이 신재욱 선수에게 커다란 함성을 보내고 있습니다! ― 이거 경기가 어떻게 흘러갈지 예상이 안 되는데요? 과연 결승전에 오를 팀은 어디가 될지 궁금하네요! 신재욱의 골 이후. 더욱 공격적으로 나온 팀은 레알 마드리드였다. 한 골을 허용했지만, 초반에 좋았던 기세를 뺏기고 싶지 않았기에 나온 경기 운영이었다. 그리고 그 사실을 신재욱은 누구보다도 빠르게 파악해냈다. “쟤들 지금 마음 급해요! 빠르게 한 골 넣어서 경기를 유리하게 이끌고 싶은 것 같은데, 우린 그냥 라인 내리고 침착하게 막고 역습하면 돼요! 가레스 베일이랑 크리스티아누 호날두의 스피드는 계속 경계하고, 루카 모드리치와 사비 알론소가 편하게 패스하지 못하게 강하게 압박해줘요!” 레알 마드리드에겐 너무나도 얄밉게 느껴지는 말이었지만, 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들에겐 시험에서 정답지를 보게 된 듯한 느낌을 받았을 정도로 든든한 말이었다. 그래서일까? 바이에른 뮌헨은 남은 시간 동안 웅크린 채 레알 마드리드의 위험한 공격들을 잘 막아내는 것에 성공했다. ― 전반전이 2 대 1로 종료됩니다! 레알 마드리드가 추가 득점을 노려봤지만, 바이에른 뮌헨이 기회를 주지 않았네요! ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 2골을 실점한 이후로는 단단한 경기력을 보여줬죠. 반면 레알 마드리드는 하나의 실점이 아쉽게 느껴질 것 같습니다. 분위기가 너무 좋은 상황에서 골을 허용한 것이거든요. 후반전은 치열했다. 레알 마드리드가 적극적으로 공격을 펼쳤고, 바이에른 뮌헨도 침착한 수비와 강한 압박을 바탕으로 경기를 풀어나갔다. ― 크리스티아누 호날두가 침투해봤지만, 오프사이드가 선언됐습니다! 방금은 바이에른 뮌헨의 오프사이드 트랩이 좋았죠? ― 맞습니다. 오늘 크리스티아누 호날두 선수가 오프사이드에 많이 걸리네요. 그만큼 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비진이 오프사이드 트랩을 잘 활용하고 있다는 거겠죠. 확실히 벤제마, 베일, 호날두로 이뤄진 레알 마드리드의 공격진은 강력했지만. 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진도 만만치 않게 강했다. 특히 신재욱이 공을 잡을 때면 레알 마드리드의 수비수들이 잔뜩 긴장했다. 1차전에 워낙 크게 당했었고, 오늘도 계속해서 위협적인 움직임을 보여주고 있었기 때문이었다. 지금도 그랬다. ― 신재욱 선수가 공을 받습니다! 오늘 경기 내내 아주 좋은 볼 키핑 능력을 보여준 신재욱 선수인데, 이번에도 공을 지켜낼 수 있을까요? 신재욱은 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거가 강하게 보낸 패스를 안전하게 받아냈고, 상대 수비수를 등졌다. 레알 마드리드의 주전선수이자 세계적인 수비수인 페페가 바싹 달라붙어서 압박을 해왔지만, 신재욱은 전혀 당황하지 않고 버텨냈다. ― 신재욱! 페페와의 몸싸움에서 밀리지 않습니다! 아~! 신재욱 선수! 공을 정말 안 뺏겨요! 페페는 필사적이었다. 옷을 잡고, 힘을 쓰며 발을 뻗었다. 조금은 지저분하다고 느껴질 정도로 수비에 집중했다. 그런데도 신재욱은 뺏기지 않았다. 영리하게 페페를 등진 채, 적절하게 페인팅을 써가며 공을 지켜냈다. 더구나 공을 지키기만 한 건 아니었다. 신재욱은 공을 지켜내며 동료들의 움직임을 놓치지 않았다. 여전히 페페에게 압박받는 상황에서. 휘익! 신재욱은 계속해서 몸을 움직이며 페페의 심리를 복잡하게 만들었다. 그리고 이제는 왼쪽으로 몸을 돌릴 것처럼 회전한 뒤. 툭! 휙! 오른쪽으로 몸을 돌렸다. 동시에 왼발로 공을 강하게 감아 찼다. 몸을 완전히 틀면서 차낸 공이 레알 마드리드의 페널티박스 안으로 휘어져 들어갔다. 레알 마드리드의 오프사이드 트랩을 뚫고 침투한 토마스 뮐러를 노린 패스였다. ― 우오오오! 좋은 패스입니다! 경기를 지켜보던 사람들이 깜짝 놀랄 정도로 예리한 패스였다. 토마스 뮐러는 일말의 망설임도 없이 몸을 던졌다. 다이빙 헤더. 자칫 다칠 수도 있는 슈팅 방법이었지만, 지금과 같은 상황에선 가장 효율적인 방법이었다. ― 우와아아아! 들어갔습니다! 토마스 뮐러! 몸을 날린 다이빙 헤더로 동점 골을 터트립니다! ― 와……이건 토마스 뮐러 선수의 침투도 좋았지만, 신재욱 선수의 플레이가 정말 좋았죠! 최전방에서 페페를 상대로 공을 지켜내면서 놀라울 정도로 예리한 패스까지 뿌려냈거든요? ― 신재욱 선수가 완성형 스트라이커가 뭔지를 제대로 보여주는 것 같습니다. 스트라이커는 꼭 골을 넣지 않더라도 방금 신재욱 선수가 했던 것처럼 최전방에서 공을 지켜주고, 버텨주는 플레이를 잘해주면 팀에 큰 도움이 되거든요! 이런 포스트 플레이는 상대 팀인 카림 벤제마 선수도 굉장히 잘하는 건데, 오늘만큼은 신재욱 선수의 포스트 플레이가 더 빛나고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 홈구장 알리안츠 아레나의 분위기가 뜨겁게 달아올랐다. 이곳을 가득 메운 바이에른 뮌헨은 팬들은 기쁨을 가라앉히지 못했다. 2 대 0으로 밀렸던 바이에른 뮌헨이 기어코 동점을 만들어냈으니까. 그러나 이들의 기쁨은 오래가지 못했다. 토마스 뮐러의 골이 터진 지 겨우 4분 뒤. 세계 최고의 선수 중 하나이자, 레알 마드리드의 에이스인 크리스티아누 호날두의 골이 터졌으니까.","output":"177 --- Although only 20 minutes into the first half had passed. The atmosphere of the game had completely shifted in favor of Real Madrid. It was because of the two goals that had been scored in a short time. ― As expected, Real Madrid is Real Madrid! Are they the same team that was pushed back in the first leg? In the second leg, they're showing a completely different side! They're already leading 2-0 against Bayern Munich! And not just any team, but against Bayern Munich! ― It's really amazing! It's really rare to see Bayern Munich being pushed back like this, isn't it? There haven't been any games in the league where they were pushed back like this, right? ― At least not this season! They've dominated almost every game, they haven't been pushed back! But now, Bayern Munich is having a very tough game in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals! It was a situation that no one had anticipated, and Real Madrid's fans watching the game in real time couldn't contain their excitement. └ Hahaha! This is Real Madrid!!!!!!! Bayern Munich was just lucky in the first leg! Today's Real Madrid is the real deal! └ Did you see? Did everyone see? This is the strength of Real Madrid! Real Madrid is the best team in the world! └ Do you see why Sergio Ramos is the best defender in the world? He scores goals better than some forwards! └ Keke! Ramos is crushing Bayern Munich! How well is Real Madrid playing today? └ Real Madrid will advance to the Champions League final! └ Even Bayern Munich can't do anything in front of Real Madrid! └ Real Madrid has started to take revenge for the first leg! └ Sergio Ramos's headers are hard to stop even when you know they're coming! At the same time. The Bayern Munich players were in a state of panic. They couldn't maintain their composure after conceding two goals in just 20 minutes of the first half. However, they tried to regain their composure, thanks to Shin Jaewook, who pointed out what needed to be improved after assessing the current team situation. ― Shin Jaewook is saying something earnestly to his teammates? ― It's not common, but whenever the team's atmosphere is not good, Shin Jaewook talks a lot to his teammates like now. And the Bayern Munich players listen very well to what Shin Jaewook says. Despite being the youngest player on the team, he was the one who scored the most goals. Moreover, he played soccer like a veteran despite having the least experience. Because it was Shin Jaewook's words, the Bayern Munich players were able to raise their concentration. ― It looks like Bayern Munich is quickly regaining stability, doesn't it? ― Really, it does. The players seemed to be flustered, didn't they? Did Shin Jaewook's words have an effect? Real Madrid continued to press Bayern Munich. They didn't stop attacking, as if they didn't want to lose the momentum they had gained from the beginning. Despite the busy attacks, the sharpness was still there. But Bayern Munich held on well. ― Bayern Munich's defense is good, isn't it? The players are not shaken! It seems like their performance has changed since they conceded two goals at the beginning! ― This is Bayern Munich! Now they're really playing like the real Bayern Munich! They showed the solid defense that they had displayed in the Bundesliga and effectively defended against Real Madrid's attacks. Moreover, they now attempted sharp counterattacks. Thwoom! Bastian Schweinsteiger passed the ball to Philipp Lahm. Philipp Lahm controlled the ball smoothly and then passed it to Thomas Müller, who was in a good position. At that moment, Thomas Müller didn't hold onto the ball. Without being greedy, he passed the ball to Lee Taek-hyun, who had started as an attacking midfielder today, which no one had expected. ― Lee Taek-hyun receives the ball! He's playing as an attacking midfielder today, which no one expected, and he hasn't had a chance to show anything yet, right? But now it seems like his opportunity has come! It would be great if he could show why manager Pep Guardiola put him in as an attacking midfielder! At that moment, Lee Taek-hyun made a play that surprised everyone. ― Lee Taek-hyun! He's bold! He makes a daring pass! A through pass attempted immediately after receiving the ball from Thomas Müller. The pass was sharp and precise. It was a pass that came out at such a fast timing and was nearly perfect in accuracy. The ball quickly arrived at Shin Jaewook's feet. ― Shin Jaewook has received the ball inside the penalty box! It's a great opportunity! In a situation where he received the ball comfortably inside the opponent's penalty box. Moreover, there was enough time to swing his leg for a shot. Whisk! Shin Jaewook swung his leg. It was a shot aimed at the difficult-to-reach top corner of the goal. ― Goooooal! It's a goal! Finally, Bayern Munich's goal has come! ― Bayern Munich's passing play was too good! Especially the last killer pass from Lee Taek-hyun was really sharp! ― Lee Taek-hyun has talent as an attacking midfielder, doesn't he? There was a reason why manager Pep Guardiola put him in as an attacking midfielder in such an important game! Lee Taek-hyun, the timing and precision of his pass are amazing! ― Shin Jaewook's first touch and shot were also perfect! After scoring the goal, Shin Jaewook raised his thumb to Lee Taek-hyun, showing his gratitude for the good pass. \\"Taek-hyun, that was a good pass. Thanks to you, I could score comfortably.\\" \\"Hehe! The timing was artistic, right? I thought you would score right away if I passed it at that timing. Ha! At this rate, I might end up playing as an attacking midfielder forever? I prefer playing as a winger...\\" \\"Don't get cocky, let's try to make one more goal before the first half ends.\\" \\"Okay! I'll give you a perfectly sweet pass, so look forward to it! Jaewook, I'll set it up perfectly, so you just score well.\\" \\"Scoring goals is my specialty.\\" \\"It's a bit annoying, but it's true. You're the Bundesliga's top scorer, after all.\\" After finishing the conversation with Lee Taek-hyun, Shin Jaewook also had a brief chat with other teammates. Then he looked at the fans filling the stands and encouraged their cheers. ― The fans' cheers are tremendous! It's fitting for Bayern Munich's home stadium! The home fans are sending a huge cheer to Shin Jaewook! ― How will this game unfold? I'm curious to see which team will advance to the final! After Shin Jaewook's goal. The team that came out more aggressively was Real Madrid. They had conceded a goal, but they didn't want to lose the good momentum they had at the beginning, so they managed the game accordingly. And Shin Jaewook was the quickest to grasp that fact. \\"They're in a hurry right now! They want to score quickly to take the lead in the game, but we just need to lower our line, stay calm, defend, and counterattack! Keep an eye on the speed of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo, and press hard so that Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso can't pass comfortably!\\" It was a statement that would have been very annoying to Real Madrid, but to the Bayern Munich players, it felt as reassuring as seeing the answer sheet in an exam. Perhaps that's why? Bayern Munich successfully managed to block Real Madrid's dangerous attacks for the remaining time. ― The first half ends 2-1! Real Madrid tried to score additional goals, but Bayern Munich didn't give them a chance! ― After conceding two goals, Bayern Munich showed solid performance. On the other hand, Real Madrid might feel regretful about conceding one goal. They allowed a goal when the atmosphere was so good. The second half was intense. Real Madrid actively attacked, and Bayern Munich unfolded the game based on calm defense and strong pressure. ― Cristiano Ronaldo tried to penetrate, but offside was called! Wasn't Bayern Munich's offside trap good just now? ― Yes. Cristiano Ronaldo has been caught offside a lot today. It means that Bayern Munich's defense is using the offside trap well. Certainly, Real Madrid's attacking line composed of Benzema, Bale, and Ronaldo was powerful. But Bayern Munich's attacking line was also not to be underestimated in strength. Especially when Shin Jaewook got the ball, Real Madrid's defenders were extremely tense. They had been severely beaten in the first leg, and today, he continued to show threatening movements. It was the same now. ― Shin Jaewook receives the ball! He's shown very good ball-keeping ability throughout today's game, but will he be able to keep the ball this time too? Shin Jaewook safely received the strong pass from Bastian Schweinsteiger and turned his back on the opposing defender. Pepe, Real Madrid's main player and a world-class defender, pressed him closely, but Shin Jaewook was not flustered and held on. ― Shin Jaewook! He doesn't get pushed around in the physical battle with Pepe! Ah~! Shin Jaewook really doesn't lose the ball! Pepe was desperate. He grabbed clothes, used strength, and stretched out his legs. He focused on defense to the point that it felt a bit dirty. But still, Shin Jaewook didn't lose the ball. Cleverly turning his back on Pepe, he used feints appropriately to keep the ball. Moreover, he didn't just keep the ball. While keeping the ball, Shin Jaewook didn't miss his teammates' movements. Even while still being pressured by Pepe. Whisk! Shin Jaewook kept moving his body, complicating Pepe's psychology. And now, as if he was going to turn to the left, he spun around. Tuck! Whisk! He turned to the right. At the same time, he curled the ball with his left foot. The ball, kicked while completely turning his body, curved into Real Madrid's penalty box. It was a pass aimed at Thomas Müller, who had broken through Real Madrid's offside trap. ― Woah! That's a good pass! It was a pass so sharp that it surprised the spectators watching the game. Thomas Müller threw himself at the ball without a moment's hesitation. Diving header. It was a shooting method that could be risky, but in a situation like this, it was the most efficient method. ― Wowww! It's in! Thomas Müller! He scores the equalizing goal with a diving header! ― Wow... That was good penetration by Thomas Müller, but Shin Jaewook's play was really good! He kept the ball against Pepe in the front line and delivered an incredibly sharp pass, right? ― Shin Jaewook seems to be showing what a complete striker is. A striker doesn't always have to score goals; just like Shin Jaewook did just now, keeping the ball in the front line and holding on is a great help to the team! This kind of post play is also something that Karim Benzema from the opposing team is very good at, but today, Shin Jaewook's post play is shining even more! The atmosphere at Bayern Munich's home stadium, Allianz Arena, was heated. The Bayern Munich fans filling the place couldn't contain their joy. Bayern Munich, who had been trailing 2-0, had managed to equalize. However, their joy didn't last long. Just 4 minutes after Thomas Müller's goal. A goal by one of the world's best players and Real Madrid's ace, Cristiano Ronaldo, was scored."},{"instruction":"What should I do right now?","output":"As an AI, I don't have personal knowledge about your current situation, goals, or preferences, so I can't provide a specific action you should take right now.

크로스가 깁니다?! 그런데 날아간 공은 신재욱의 키를 넘겼다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 애초에 신재욱의 머리를 노린 크로스가 아니었으니까. 반대편에서 빠른 속도로 들어오는 이택현의 머리를 노린 크로스였으니까. ― 공이 이택현에게로 향합니다! 이택현은 달려오는 힘을 이용해 높게 점프했다. 몸을 공중에 띄운 상태에서도 안정적인 자세를 유지하며 머리로 공을 찍어 내렸다. 터엉! 공은 골대 안쪽으로 빠르게 날아갔다. 레알 마드리드의 골키퍼 이케르 카시야스가 몸을 움직이려고 했지만 그러지 못했다. 그 역시 신재욱과 프랑크 리베리에게 완전히 속아버렸기에 반응하지 못한 것이었다. 철썩! 레알 마드리드의 골망이 시원하게 흔들렸다. 이택현의 선제골이었다. ― 고오오오오오올! 들어갔습니다! 이택현입니다! 이택현 선수가 레알 마드리드를 상대로 선제골을 터트렸습니다! ― 엄청난 골이 나왔습니다! 프랑크 리베리 선수와 신재욱 선수가 레알 마드리드의 수비진을 완전히 속였어요! 누가 보더라도 신재욱 선수에게 크로스할 것처럼 보였는데, 반대편에서 달려오는 이택현 선수를 노렸거든요? 이야……이 골은 신재욱 선수의 연기력이 워낙 뛰어나서 속을 수밖에 없었던 것 같습니다. ― 이택현 선수의 마무리도 훌륭했죠? ― 당연합니다. 공을 가지지 않았을 때의 이택현 선수의 움직임은 날이 갈수록 좋아지고 있거든요? 결정력도 마찬가지고요! 방금도 이 모든 게 충족되는 골이었습니다. 경기장의 분위기가 싸늘하게 식었다. 산티아고 베르나베우. 레알 마드리드의 홈구장에 가득한 홈팬들이 허탈한 얼굴로 이택현을 바라봤다. 그러나 그것도 잠시. 관중석을 메운 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 골을 넣은 이택현을 향해 야유를 퍼붓기 시작했다. ― 이택현 선수가 특유의 세리머니를 보여주고 있습니다! 하하! 벌써 백덤블링을 몇 번이나 하는 거죠? 이 정도면 서커스 선수라고 해도 믿겠네요! ― 관중석에서 야유가 터져 나오고 있는데, 이택현 선수는 전혀 신경 쓰지 않는 것 같네요! 하하! 이 선수의 배짱은 정말 대단합니다! 얄미울 정도로 여러 번의 백덤블링 세리머니를 펼치는 이택현의 모습. 그 모습에 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 약이 바짝 오를 수밖에 없었다. 우우우우우우우! 야유는 더욱 커졌다. “으하핫! 다들 내 헤더 봤죠? 다들 기대해도 좋아요. 저 오늘 컨디션 미치게 좋으니까요!” 세리머니를 마친 이택현은 여전히 야유는 전혀 신경 쓰지 않고 동료들과 기쁨을 나눴다. 그리고 그 모습을 본 신재욱은 옅은 미소를 지었다. ‘많이 성장했네 이택현. 산티아고 베르나베우에서 이 정도 야유를 받으면서도 괜찮아 보이고.’ 레알 마드리드의 팬들의 광기는 엄청나기로 유명하다. 특히 홈에서 보여주는 팬들의 광기는 상대 팀 선수들을 위축되게 만들곤 한다. 그런데 이택현은 영향을 받지 않고 있었다. 정신력이 강해졌기에 가능한 일이었다. ― 이제 스코어는 1 대 0입니다! 이러면 레알 마드리드가 급해질 수밖에 없죠? ― 그렇습니다. 레알 마드리드는 어떻게든 골을 넣고, 이기려고 할 겁니다. 홈경기이기 때문에 자존심이 걸려있거든요. 경기가 재개된 이후, 레알 마드리드의 분위기가 변했다. 선제골을 허용하기 전까진 아직 경기에 집중하지 못한 모습이었다면, 이제는 긴장이 풀린 모습이었다. 움직임도 한층 더 부드러워졌다. 그래서일까? 레알 마드리드는 빠르게 경기의 분위기를 잡아나갔다. ― 루카 모드리치, 좋은 탈압박입니다! 루카 모드리치가 사비 알론소에게 공을 연결합니다. 사비 알론소는 레알 마드리드 내에서 패스가 가장 좋은 선수 중 한 명이었고. 지금도 그는 측면으로 달리는 디 마리아를 향해 정확한 롱패스를 뿌려냈다. ― 예리한 패스입니다! 디 마리아가 공을 받아냅니다! 디 마리아 선수! 볼 터치가 정말 좋네요! 디 마리아는 피지컬이 좋지 못하다는 단점이 있지만, 윙어와 미드필더로서의 다른 능력 대부분이 뛰어난 월드클래스 선수였다. 지금도 그의 능력은 빛났다. ― 돌파했습니다! 디 마리아 선수가 바이에른 뮌헨의 측면 수비를 뚫어냈습니다! 디 마리아는 좋은 드리블을 보여주며 측면을 파고들었다. 더 나아가 바이에른 뮌헨의 위험지역으로 깊숙이 침투했다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 페널티박스 안엔 어느새 크리스티아누 호날두, 카림 벤제마, 가레스 베일이 자리를 잡고 있었다. 바이에른 뮌헨 수비수들로선 긴장할 수밖에 없는 상황. 이때, 디 마리아가 왼발로 공을 툭― 밀어냈다. 페널티박스 바깥에 있던 루카 모드리치를 향한 패스였다. 골을 잘 넣는 호날두, 베일, 벤제마를 두고 루카 모드리치에게 패스했다는 것. 앙헬 디 마리아는 그 선택으로 바이에른 뮌헨 수비수들의 허를 찔렀다. 그리고 루카 모드리치는 기다렸다는 듯 강력한 슈팅을 때려냈다. 퍼어엉! 발등에 제대로 걸린 슈팅이었다. 워낙 잘 맞아서 루카 모드리치는 골을 확신했다. 그러나 그의 확신과는 다르게, 슈팅은 골로 연결되지 않았다. ― 우오오오! 보아텡이 루카 모드리치의 슈팅을 몸을 던져서 막아냈습니다! ― 방금은 바이에른 뮌헨이 굉장한 위기를 맞았었죠! 루카 모드리치 선수의 슈팅이 보아텡 선수의 몸에 맞지 않았다면, 그래도 빨려 들어갔을 것 같았거든요? ― 루카 모드리치 선수도 아쉬워하네요. 루카 모드리치의 슈팅 궤적에 마침 보아텡이 서 있었다는 것. 바이에른 뮌헨에겐 행운이었다. 실점할 수도 있었던 위기를 벗어났지만, 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 기뻐하지 못했다. 레알 마드리드의 공격이 매섭다는 걸 확실하게 느꼈기 때문이었다. ― 비록 골이 되진 않았지만, 레알 마드리드가 명성에 걸맞은 공격을 보여주네요! 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 긴장해야 할 것 같습니다! ― 이런 공격력이라면 바이에른 뮌헨 수비진이 경기 내내 고생할 수도 있을 것 같은데요? ― 경기가 더욱 재밌어지고 있습니다! 양 팀 모두 서로의 수비를 위협할 수 있는 공격력을 지녔기 때문에 긴장감이 넘치네요! 레알 마드리드와 바이에른 뮌헨. 양 팀 모두 공격적인 운영을 펼쳤다. 서로의 중앙과 측면을 골고루 노리며 기회를 만들려고 했다. 툭! 최전방에 있던 신재욱이 공을 받았다. 곧바로 등 뒤에서 강한 충격이 느껴졌다. 세르히오 라모스의 압박이었다. ‘라모스. 경기장에서의 존재감이 대단한 사람이야.’ 세르히오 라모스는 손과 발, 무릎을 적절히 써가며 신재욱을 압박했다. 신재욱이 몸을 돌리는 걸 철저하게 방해했다. ‘내가 가려는 길을 미리 알고 막아버리는 느낌이야. 역시 최고 수준의 수비수라는 건가?’ 그러나 세르히오 라모스가 모르는 게 있었다. 상대인 신재욱이 세계 최고의 스트라이커였던 선수라는 것을. 세계 최고의 수비수들과 여러 번 상대해봤고 수없이 많이 이겨봤던 선수라는 것을. 휘익! 신재욱은 세르히오 라모스를 등진 채로 왼쪽으로 상체를 돌렸다. 영락없이 턴을 할 것 같은 페인팅이었다. 이에 세르히오 라모스는 속지 않았다. 그러자 신재욱은 정말로 몸을 돌리며 어깨를 집어넣었다. 그 순간 세르히오 라모스가 방해했다. 강력한 힘과 순발력을 이용해 신재욱이 몸을 돌리는 걸 다시 한번 막아내려고 했다. 그 순간 신재욱이 반대 방향으로 몸을 회전했다. 매우 빠른 순간에 나온 움직이었다. ‘이러면 최고 수준의 수비수도 당할 수밖에 없지.’ 세르히오 라모스의 수비를 뚫어낸 상황. 그러나 신재욱은 더 전진하지 못했다. 레알 마드리드의 또 다른 중앙수비수 페페가 덤벼들고 있었기 때문이었다. 그러나 신재욱은 전진하지 않았을 뿐, 가만히 있진 않았다. 발바닥을 이용해 공을 옆으로 굴렸다. 어느새 레알 마드리드의 페널티박스 안으로 침투한 이택현을 향한 패스였다. 툭! 이택현은 달려오는 속도를 줄이며 오른발 안쪽으로 공을 받아냈다. 그러곤 양발잡이 선수답게 왼발로 공을 툭 밀었다. 슈팅할 각도를 잡는 과정이었다. 다음으로 오른발을 휘둘러 공을 때려냈다. 골대와 가까운 곳에서 시도한 슈팅이었다. 퍼엉! 공은 구석으로 향했다. 현시점에서 세계 최고의 골키퍼 중 하나인 이케르 카시야스가 몸을 날렸다. 첫 번째 골을 허용했을 때와는 다르게, 이번엔 이택현의 슈팅에 반응한 것이다. 게다가 그 짧은 순간에 슈팅의 방향까지 맞춰냈다. 휘익! 이케르 카시야스가 팔을 쭉 뻗었다. 공의 궤적이 조금만 더 골대의 구석으로 향했다면 카시야스의 손에 닿지 않았겠지만. 이택현이 때려낸 슈팅은 구석보다 조금 더 안쪽으로 향했다. 틱! 휘어져 들어가던 공이 이케르 카시야스의 손끝에 걸렸다. 축구에서 흔히 핑거팁이라고 불리는 골키퍼의 슈퍼세이브가 나온 것이다. 그 순간 이곳 산티아고 베르나베우에 있던 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 함성을 터트렸다. 아니, 터트리려고 했다. 그러나 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 터져 나오려는 함성을 참아내야만 했다. “헙……!” “세입……흡!” “어어?!” “어…?” 이케르 카시야스의 손끝에 걸리며 튕겨 나가는 공. 그 공을 향해 발을 뻗은 선수 때문이었다. 툭! 신재욱은 발끝을 정교하게 움직였다. 튕겨 나가려던 공을 다시 레알 마드리드의 골대 안으로 넣기 위함이었다. ‘이럴 것 같았어.’ 공이 골대 안으로 들어가는 것을 보며, 신재욱의 입가에 미소가 지어졌다. 자신이 했음에도 매우 만족스러운 결과였다. ‘사람들이 많이 놀라겠는데?’ 이케르 카시야스 골키퍼가 이택현의 슈팅을 막아낼 것을 예상하고, 카시야스가 공을 튕겨낼 위치까지 예상해서 미리 발을 뻗는 것. 그 행동으로 골을 만들어낸 것. 직접 보지 않고서는 믿을 수 없는 장면이었다. 물론 직접 봤음에도 믿기 힘든 장면이었다. 그래서일까? 신재욱의 골이 터진 지금. 레알 마드리드의 홈구장 ‘산티아고 베르나베우’가 놀라울 정도로 조용해졌다.","output":"174 --- When playing soccer, there are teammates with whom one's breathing just naturally syncs up. It was the same on the professional stage. Regardless of whether their skills were similar or different, there were always teammates whose coordination was surprisingly good. And this applied to Shin Jaewook as well. Even before his reincarnation, and now after reincarnation, there were players with whom he had an exceptionally good rapport. \\"Franck!\\" Franck Ribéry, the team's left winger, was one of those players. 'You know, right?' Shin Jaewook called out Franck Ribéry's name loudly, but he didn't say anything else. He simply raised one hand high—that was the end of the signal. At the same time as that gesture, Shin Jaewook penetrated deep into Real Madrid's penalty box. At that moment, Real Madrid's defenders Pepe and Sergio Ramos turned their attention to Shin Jaewook. They were already wary of Shin Jaewook, but now that he had infiltrated the penalty box, they couldn't ignore him. Moreover, he was now calling for Franck Ribéry with a raised hand. Then, Franck Ribéry sent in a cross. Boom! — Franck Ribéry! The cross! The ball curved into the penalty box. Sergio Ramos and Pepe instinctively moved towards Shin Jaewook. Both defenders had the same thought. They intended to prevent Shin Jaewook from heading the ball. — Oh? Is the cross too long?! But the ball flew over Shin Jaewook's head. It had to. The cross wasn't aimed at Shin Jaewook's head in the first place. It was aimed at the head of Lee Taekhyun, who was rushing in from the opposite side. — The ball is heading towards Lee Taekhyun! Lee Taekhyun jumped high, using the momentum of his run. Even while suspended in the air, he maintained a stable posture and headed the ball down sharply. Thud! The ball flew quickly towards the inside of the goal. Real Madrid's goalkeeper Iker Casillas tried to move, but he couldn't. He had been completely fooled by Shin Jaewook and Franck Ribéry and failed to react. Slap! Real Madrid's net shook satisfyingly. It was Lee Taekhyun's opening goal. — Goooooal! It's in! Lee Taekhyun! Lee Taekhyun has scored the opening goal against Real Madrid! — What an incredible goal! Franck Ribéry and Shin Jaewook completely deceived Real Madrid's defense! Anyone would have thought the cross was meant for Shin Jaewook, but it was aimed at Lee Taekhyun, who was running in from the opposite side. Wow... This goal was possible because of Shin Jaewook's excellent acting skills. — Was Lee Taekhyun's finish also excellent? — Of course. Lee Taekhyun's movement without the ball is improving day by day, right? His decisiveness is the same! Just now, we saw a goal where all of these elements came together. The atmosphere in the stadium turned chilly. Santiago Bernabéu. The home fans filling Real Madrid's home stadium looked at Lee Taekhyun with a sense of defeat. But that was only for a moment. The Real Madrid fans in the stands began to pour out jeers towards Lee Taekhyun, who had scored the goal. — Lee Taekhyun is showing off his signature ceremony! Ha-ha! How many backflips is he doing already? At this rate, you'd believe he's a circus performer! — Jeers are erupting from the stands, but it seems like Lee Taekhyun doesn't care at all! Ha-ha! This player's guts are really something! The sight of Lee Taekhyun performing several backflip ceremonies was enough to infuriate the Real Madrid fans. Booooo! The jeers grew louder. \\"Uh-hah-hat! Did you all see my header? You can all look forward to it. My condition is insanely good today!\\" After finishing his ceremony, Lee Taekhyun shared his joy with his teammates, seemingly unaffected by the jeers. Seeing this, Shin Jaewook smiled faintly. 'Lee Taekhyun has grown a lot. He seems okay even while receiving such jeers at Santiago Bernabéu.' Real Madrid's fans are famously intense. Especially at home, the madness of the fans can intimidate opposing players. But Lee Taekhyun was unaffected. His mental strength had grown stronger, making this possible. — Now the score is 1-0! Real Madrid will have to get anxious now, right? — That's right. Real Madrid will try to score and win by any means. It's a home game, so their pride is at stake. After the game resumed, the atmosphere of Real Madrid changed. Before conceding the opening goal, they seemed unfocused, but now they appeared more relaxed. Their movements became smoother. Perhaps that's why? Real Madrid quickly took control of the game's atmosphere. — Luka Modrić, nice dribbling! Luka Modrić connects the ball to Xabi Alonso. Xabi Alonso was one of the players with the best passing ability in Real Madrid. Even now, he delivered a precise long pass to Di María, who was running along the flank. — Sharp pass! Di María receives the ball! Di María's ball touch is really good! Although Di María had the disadvantage of not being physically strong, he was a world-class player with outstanding abilities as a winger and midfielder. His talent shone even now. — He's broken through! Di María has penetrated Bayern Munich's flank defense! Di María showed good dribbling and penetrated the flank. He even infiltrated deep into Bayern Munich's danger zone. In Bayern Munich's penalty box, Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and Gareth Bale were already positioned. For Bayern Munich's defenders, it was a tense situation. Then, Di María pushed the ball with his left foot. It was a pass aimed at Luka Modrić, who was outside the penalty box. Passing to Modrić instead of goal-scorers Ronaldo, Bale, and Benzema. Ángel Di María's choice pierced through Bayern Munich's defense. And Luka Modrić, as if he had been waiting, unleashed a powerful shot. Boom! It was a well-struck shot. Modrić was so confident that he believed it was a goal. However, contrary to his belief, the shot did not result in a goal. — Wow! Boateng throws himself to block Luka Modrić's shot! — Bayern Munich just faced a tremendous crisis! If Boateng hadn't blocked Modrić's shot, it would have probably gone in, right? — Luka Modrić looks disappointed. Luka Modrić's shot trajectory happened to be where Boateng was standing. It was lucky for Bayern Munich. They avoided a potential goal, but Bayern Munich's players couldn't celebrate. They felt the ferocity of Real Madrid's attack. — Although it wasn't a goal, Real Madrid is showing an attack worthy of their reputation! It seems like Bayern Munich's players will have to be tense! — With this kind of attacking power, Bayern Munich's defense might suffer throughout the game, right? — The game is getting even more exciting! Both teams have the offensive power to threaten each other's defense, so the tension is high! Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Both teams played offensively. They tried to create opportunities by targeting each other's center and flanks. Thump! Shin Jaewook, at the forefront, received the ball. Immediately, he felt a strong impact from behind. It was Sergio Ramos's pressure. 'Ramos. A person with a significant presence on the field.' Sergio Ramos used his hands, feet, and knees appropriately to pressure Shin Jaewook. He thoroughly prevented Shin Jaewook from turning around. 'It feels like he already knows where I'm going and blocks it. Is this what it's like to be a top-level defender?' But Sergio Ramos didn't know something. That his opponent, Shin Jaewook, was a player who had been the world's best striker. A player who had faced the world's best defenders numerous times and had beaten them countless times. Swoosh! Shin Jaewook, with his back to Sergio Ramos, turned his upper body to the left. It was a feint that looked like he was going to turn. Ramos didn't fall for it. Then, Shin Jaewook really turned his body and put his shoulder into it. At that moment, Ramos interfered. Using his strong power and quick reflexes, he tried to block Shin Jaewook from turning once again. At that moment, Shin Jaewook rotated his body in the opposite direction. It was a very fast movement. 'Even the best defenders can't handle this.' Shin Jaewook had broken through Sergio Ramos's defense. However, he couldn't advance further. Another Real Madrid central defender, Pepe, was rushing at him. But Shin Jaewook didn't just stand still, he didn't advance. He rolled the ball to the side with the sole of his foot. It was a pass aimed at Lee Taekhyun, who had already infiltrated Real Madrid's penalty box. Thump! Lee Taekhyun slowed down his running speed and received the ball with the inside of his right foot. Then, as a two-footed player, he nudged the ball with his left foot. It was the process of setting up the angle for a shot. Next, he swung his right foot and struck the ball. It was a shot attempted close to the goal. Boom! The ball headed towards the corner. Iker Casillas, one of the world's best goalkeepers at the time, leaped. Unlike when he conceded the first goal, this time he reacted to Lee Taekhyun's shot. And in that short moment, he even guessed the direction of the shot. Swoosh! Iker Casillas stretched out his arm. If the ball's trajectory had been a little more towards the corner of the goal, it wouldn't have reached Casillas's hand. But Lee Taekhyun's shot was aimed slightly more towards the inside than the corner. Tick! The curving ball was tipped by Iker Casillas's fingertips. It was a goalkeeper's super save, commonly referred to as a fingertip in soccer. At that moment, the Real Madrid fans at Santiago Bernabéu erupted in cheers. Or rather, they tried to. But the Real Madrid fans had to hold back the cheers that were about to burst out. \\"Huh...!\\" \\"Save...!\\" \\"Oh?!\\" \\"Uh...?\\" The ball, deflected by Iker Casillas's fingertips, was about to bounce away. It was because of the player who stretched out his foot towards the ball. Thump! Shin Jaewook moved his toes precisely. It was to put the ball, which was about to bounce away, back into Real Madrid's goal. 'I thought this might happen.' As the ball went into the goal, a smile formed on Shin Jaewook's lips. Even though he had done it himself, he was very satisfied with the result. 'People will be quite surprised, won't they?' Anticipating that Iker Casillas would block Lee Taekhyun's shot and even predicting where Casillas would deflect the ball to extend his foot in advance. With that action, he created a goal. It was a scene that was hard to believe without seeing it directly. And even for those who saw it directly, it was hard to believe. Perhaps that's why? Now that Shin Jaewook's goal had been scored. Real Madrid's home stadium 'Santiago Bernabéu' became eerily quiet."},{"instruction":"176 * * * 대부분의 능력치가 80대 후반이 된 이후로 성장의 속도는 매우 느려졌었다. 많은 경기에서 공격포인트를 기록하고 좋은 활약을 펼쳤음에도 성장은 더뎠다. 그랬기에 능력치가 올랐다는 5개의 메시지가 더욱 반갑게 느껴졌다. [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] [몸싸움이 1 올랐습니다!] [태클이 1 올랐습니다!] [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] [대인방어가 1 올랐습니다!] “축구 할 맛 나네.” 신재욱이 미소를 지었다. 그러자 바이에른 뮌헨을 응원하던 팬들이 함성을 터트렸다. 우와아아아! 경기가 치러지고 있는 장소는 레알 마드리드의 홈구장이었지만, 이곳에도 바이에른 뮌헨의 팬들은 존재했다. 그것도 꽤 많이. ― 신재욱 선수가 레알 마드리드를 상대로 2골을 기록하며 3 대 0 스코어를 만들었는데요, 레알 마드리드는 남은 시간 동안 어떻게 경기를 풀어갈까요? ― 레알 마드리드 선수들은 머리가 아플 것 같네요. 경기의 흐름은 완전히 넘어갔는데, 2차전을 생각하면 어떻게든 스코어 차이를 좁혀야만 하거든요. 그렇다고 무작정 공격적으로 하기엔 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습이 무섭거든요? 급한 상황이었지만 레알 마드리드는 쉽게 공격하지 못했다. 해설들의 말처럼 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습을 경계했기 때문이었다. ― 그렇습니다. 바이에른 뮌헨에는 신재욱 선수도 있지만, 역습 시에 특히나 무서운 모습을 보여주는 이택현 선수와 프랑크 리베리 선수가 있거든요! 그러나 레알 마드리드 선수들의 마음은 급했다. 이번 경기에서 승리하지는 못하더라도 2차전을 위해서라면 최대한 많은 골을 넣을 필요가 있었으니까. ― 레알 마드리드가 이제야 템포를 높이네요! 선수도 교체해주네요! 더욱 공격적으로 나갈 생각인 것 같죠? ― 지금은 잴 때가 아니거든요. 바이에른 뮌헨의 역습이 무섭지만, 그래도 공격을 해야만 하는 시간입니다. 레알 마드리드 선수들은 적극적으로 공격을 펼쳤다. 그런데 그 공격의 수준이 매우 높았다. 투욱! 카림 벤제마가 최전방에서 공을 받았다. 뒤에서 강하게 압박하는 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비수 단테를 등진 채, 흔들림 없이 공을 컨트롤했다. 이어서 벤제마는 근처에 있는 루카 모드리치에게 패스했다. 루카 모드리치는 부드러운 터치로 공을 받아낸 뒤, 곧바로 측면으로 패스를 뿌렸다. 디 마리아를 향한 패스였다. 오늘 컨디션이 좋은 디 마리아는 자신감 있게 왼발 크로스를 올렸다. “막아!” “걷어내!” “개인 마크 놓치지 마!” 바이에른 뮌헨 수비진에서 몇 개의 말들이 다급하게 터져 나왔다. 집중력을 높이기 위해서 경각심을 일으키는 말들이었다. 그러나 전방에서 동료들의 모습을 보던 신재욱은 아쉬운 표정으로 입맛을 다셨다. ‘뚫리겠는데.’ 그의 눈엔 보였다. 헤더를 하기 위해서 허공으로 몸을 띄우는 크리스티아누 호날두의 모습이. ‘저 사람의 점프 능력은 볼 때마다 신기하다니까?’ 보아텡이 바로 옆에 붙어서 함께 뛰었지만, 크리스티아누 호날두의 점프력이 훨씬 좋았다. 헤더도 강력했다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 골키퍼 마누엘 노이어는 세계 최고 수준의 골키퍼였지만, 예상할 수 없는 방향으로 날아오는 호날두의 헤더를 막아내지 못했다. ― 어어어어?! 들어갔습니다! 레알 마드리드의 골입니다! 크리스티아누 호날두! 엄청난 점프력을 바탕으로 한 헤더로 바이에른 뮌헨의 골문을 열었습니다! ― 놀라운 골인데요? 경기 내내 단단한 모습을 보여줬던 바이에른 뮌헨이 이렇게 골을 허용하네요. ― 이게 바로 크리스티아누 호날두의 능력이죠. 어떤 상황에서도 골을 만들어낼 수 있는 선수거든요. 괜히 세계 최고 수준의 선수가 아니라는 걸 이렇게 보여주네요. 골을 기록하며 3 대 1 스코어를 만든 레알 마드리드는 계속해서 공격에 집중했다. 반면 바이에른 뮌헨은 수비에 집중했다. 경기 내내 많이 뛴 신재욱과 프랑크 리베리를 빼주며 수비가 좋은 선수 2명을 투입했다. “신재욱 선수, 고생했어요. 다음 경기를 위해서 교체해준 거예요.” “알죠.” 신재욱은 교체의 이유를 설명해주는 과르디올라 감독과 가벼운 포옹을 한 뒤, 남은 시간을 확인했다. 경기가 종료될 때까지 시간은 많지 않았다. ‘역전은 안 나오겠네.’ 안심이 할 수 있는 시간대였다. 물론 기세가 오른 레알 마드리드는 기적을 만들어낼 수 있는 팀이지만, 그것도 시간이 있을 때 가능한 얘기다. ‘다들 마지막까지 힘내서 추가 실점 없이 끝냈으면 좋겠는데.’ 이후, 남은 시간이 많지 않은 상황에서 바이에른 뮌헨은 수비에만 집중했다. 대놓고 수비만 하는 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로 레알 마드리드는 기회를 만들어내지 못했다. 삐이이익! ― 챔피언스리그 4강 1차전이 종료됩니다! 바이에른 뮌헨이 3 대 1로 승리하며, 결승행의 가능성을 높였습니다! ― 레알 마드리드로서는 좋지 않은 경기였죠? 홈에서의 경기였기 때문에 이겼어야만 했거든요? 이제 결승에 진출하기 위해서는 2차전에서 많은 골을 넣어야만 하는 레알 마드리드입니다. 레알 마드리드와 바이에른 뮌헨의 2차전은 빠르게 다가왔다. 고작 일주일 뒤였으니까. ― 양 팀 선수들이 경기장에 입장하고 있습니다! 1차전에서 3 대 1로 승리하며 유리한 위치에 있는 바이에른 뮌헨과 꼭 이겨야만 하는 레알 마드리드! 과연 결승에 올라가게 되는 팀은 어디일까요? ― 결과는 알 수 없지만, 최근 경기를 보면 레알 마드리드보단 바이에른 뮌헨의 분위기가 더 좋긴 합니다. 며칠 전에 리그 경기에서 무승부를 거둔 레알 마드리드와는 다르게 바이에른 뮌헨은 3일 전에 리그에서 베르더 브레멘을 상대로 대승을 거뒀거든요? ― 맞습니다. 엄청난 화력을 보여주며 6 대 2 승리를 거뒀죠. 그 경기에서 신재욱 선수는 해트트릭을 기록하기까지 했고요. ― 스트라이커인 신재욱 선수의 득점 감각이 물이 오를 대로 오른 상황인데, 과연 레알 마드리드와의 2차전에서도 골을 기록할 수 있을지! 기대됩니다! 바이에른 뮌헨과 레알 마드리드의 2차전. 이 경기가 펼쳐지기 직전, 많은 축구팬들은 확신했다. 1차전에서 3 대 1로 승리했고, 홈구장에서 2차전을 펼치게 된 바이에른 뮌헨이 결승에 올라갈 거라고. └ 확률적으로 봤을 때, 바이에른 뮌헨이 결승에 올라갈 수밖에 없어. 홈구장 효과에 점수 차가 2점이나 나잖아? 이건 이 정도 수준의 팀들에겐 엄청난 차이야. └ 나도 바이에른 뮌헨이 이긴다고 생각해. 얘넨 최근 기세가 좋아도 너무 좋아. 특히 신재욱! 얘는 그냥 미친 것 같아. └ 신재욱이라는 괴물을 보유한 바이에른 뮌헨이 결승에 가겠지. └ 간단하게 생각해보자. 레알 마드리드의 수비진이 신재욱, 이택현, 프랑크 리베리를 막을 수 있을까? 난 아니라고 봐. 우리 모두 1차전에서 다 봤잖아? └ 레알 마드리드는 세계 최고의 화력을 가진 팀이지만, 이번 시즌의 바이에른 뮌헨은 차원이 다른 팀이야. 너희 이거 알아? 바이에른 뮌헨은 지금 리그에서 32연승 중이야. └ 아무리 레알 마드리드라고 해도 32연승 중인 팀을 어떻게 이기겠어? 크리스티아누 호날두, 카림 벤제마, 가레스 베일도 1차전엔 크게 힘을 쓰지 못했잖아. 그나마 호날두만 1골을 넣었지만 그게 끝이었잖아. └ 바이에른 뮌헨이 결승에 올라가겠군. 그리고 우승도 어렵지 않게 하겠지. 이번 시즌은 완전히 바이에른 뮌헨의 세상이 되겠구만. 이런 축구팬들의 반응은 이상한 게 아니었다. 그만큼 바이에른 뮌헨의 기세가 강했으니까. 그런데 막상 경기가 시작되자, 전 세계 축구팬들의 예상을 벗어난 일이 벌어졌다. ― 오늘 레알 마드리드 선수들의 움직임이 너무 좋은데요? 공격이 정말 날카롭습니다! 레알 마드리드가 경기 시작과 동시에 강한 압박과 적극적인 공격으로 바이에른 뮌헨을 몰아붙이더니, 이윽고 골까지 만들어냈다. 더구나 골을 넣은 선수는 수비수인 세르히오 라모스였다. ― 세르히오 라모스! 환상적인 헤더로 선제골을 기록했습니다! ― 이 선수는 키가 엄청 큰 편이 아닌데도 헤더골을 매우 잘 넣는 선수죠! 자신의 공중볼 경합 능력을 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로도 보여주는 세르히오 라모스입니다! ― 괜히 골 넣는 수비수라고 불리는 선수가 아니네요~! 전반전 15분이 되기도 전에 나온 세르히오 라모스의 골이었다. 깜짝 놀란 바이에른 뮌헨의 선수들이 침착하게 경기 운영을 하려고 했지만, 뛰어난 실력과 강한 투지를 바탕으로 한 레알 마드리드의 압박에 고전했다. 몇 분 뒤, 기세를 탄 레알 마드리드는 또다시 기회를 만들어냈다. ― 코너킥입니다! 가레스 베일 선수가 기어코 코너킥을 만들어내네요! ― 많은 수의 팬분들과 전문가들의 예상과는 다르게 바이에른 뮌헨이 경기 초반부터 너무 밀리는데요? 지금도 쉽게 생각해서는 안 됩니다. 레알 마드리드는 세트피스에서 매우 강력한 팀이라는 걸 절대 잊으면 안 됩니다! 조금 전에 나온 골도 세트피스 상황에서 나온 것이고요. 가레스 베일이 만든 코너킥. 그 코너킥을 루카 모드리치가 찼다. 퍼어엉! 킥 정확도가 매우 좋은 루카 모드리치답게 공은 날카로운 궤적을 그리며 바이에른 뮌헨의 페널티박스 안으로 날아들었다. 양 팀 모두 높은 집중력을 유지하던 상황. 그런 상황에서 날아오는 공을 머리에 맞춘 선수는 세르히오 라모스였다. ― 우와아아아아! 골입니다! 이번에도 세르히오 라모스입니다! 세르히오 라모스 선수가 또다시 헤더골을 터트렸습니다! ― 이야! 이건 큰데요? 바이에른 뮌헨으로서는 충격을 받을 수밖에 없는 골이죠! 공격수도 아닌 수비수에게 2골이나 실점하다니요! ― 세르히오 라모스 선수! 팀을 구하고 있습니다! 레알 마드리드가 기적을 만들어내나요? 전반전 20분이 지나기도 전에 나온 두 번째 실점. 그것도 비슷한 상황에서 나온 실점이라는 것. 바이에른 뮌헨에겐 뼈아픈 상황이었다. 선수들의 사기를 단번에 떨어뜨릴 만한 상황이었고, 실제로 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들의 좋았던 기세는 순식간에 사라져버렸다. ‘이건……위험한데?’ 신재욱의 표정도 심각해졌다. 많은 경기에서 좋은 활약을 펼치고 늘 자신감을 잃지 않는 그였지만, 패배했던 경험이 없는 건 아니었다. 그래서 알 수 있었다. 지금과 같은 분위기는 팀에게 매우 위험하다는 걸. 패배하게 되는 분위기로 가고 있다는 걸. ‘레알 마드리드의 기세가 너무 좋아졌어. 어떻게든 흐름을 끊어야 해.’ 신재욱은 동료들을 향해 소리쳤다. 집중하라는 말, 그리고 맡은 상대를 끝까지 놓치지 말라는 이야기, 부족했던 디테일에 관련된 이야기와 지금보다 더 강하게 압박해서 상대의 흐름을 끊을 필요가 있다는 말까지. 지금 상황에서 필요한 말들을 전부 쏟아냈고. 바이에른 뮌헨 동료들은 고개를 끄덕였다. 이들 모두 신재욱이 지닌 특별함을 알고 있었기에, 아무도 반대 의견을 내세우지 않았다. ‘믿어보자. 신재욱은 경험이 적지만, 베테랑 선수들보다도 경기를 잘 보는 친구니까.’ ‘신재욱이 그렇다면 그런 거지.’ ‘저 말대로 해보자. 저 친구 말만 잘 들으면 다 이겼잖아?’ ‘재욱은 틀린 말을 한 적이 없어.’ 전반 20분에 0 대 2 스코어로 바이에른 뮌헨이 밀리게 된 상황. 기세에서도 밀리고, 분위기도 완전히 레알 마드리드 측으로 넘어간 상황. 그런 상황 속에서 경기가 재개됐다.","output":"176 --- After most of his stats reached the high 80s, the speed of his growth slowed down significantly. Despite recording offensive points and performing well in many games, his growth was sluggish. That's why the messages indicating an increase in his stats were all the more welcome. [Agility has increased by 1!] [Physical has increased by 1!] [Tackling has increased by 1!] [Stamina has increased by 1!] [Man-to-Man Defense has increased by 1!] \\"Playing soccer feels great.\\" Shin Jaewook smiled. Then the Bayern Munich fans erupted in cheers. Wowwww! Although the match was taking place at Real Madrid's home stadium, there were quite a lot of Bayern Munich fans present. — Shin Jaewook has scored 2 goals against Real Madrid, making the score 3-0. How will Real Madrid manage the game in the remaining time? — The Real Madrid players must have a headache. The flow of the game has completely turned, and considering the second leg, they need to close the score gap as much as possible. But they can't just attack recklessly because Bayern Munich's counterattacks are fearsome, right? Despite the urgency, Real Madrid couldn't easily attack. As the commentators said, they were wary of Bayern Munich's counterattacks. — That's right. Not only do they have Shin Jaewook, but Bayern Munich also has Lee Taekhyun and Franck Ribéry, who are particularly dangerous on the counter. However, the Real Madrid players were in a hurry. Even if they couldn't win this game, they needed to score as many goals as possible for the second leg. — Real Madrid is finally picking up the tempo! They're making substitutions too! It seems like they're planning to be more aggressive, right? — Now is not the time to hold back. Despite the fear of Bayern Munich's counterattacks, it's time to attack. The Real Madrid players launched aggressive attacks. And the level of their attacks was very high. Thwack! Karim Benzema received the ball at the front. With Bayern Munich's defender Dante pressing hard from behind, Benzema controlled the ball without faltering. Then Benzema passed the ball to nearby Luka Modrić. Modrić received the ball with a smooth touch and immediately sent a pass to the flank. It was aimed at Di María. Di María, in good condition today, confidently sent in a left-footed cross. \\"Block it!\\" \\"Clear it!\\" \\"Don't lose your mark!\\" Several urgent shouts came from the Bayern Munich defense. These were words to raise alertness and increase concentration. However, Shin Jaewook, watching his teammates from the front, clicked his tongue with a disappointed expression. 'It's going to break through.' He could see it. The sight of Cristiano Ronaldo leaping into the air to head the ball. 'His jumping ability is always amazing.' Boateng was right next to him, jumping together, but Ronaldo's jumping power was far superior. His header was powerful too. Manuel Neuer, one of the world's best goalkeepers, couldn't stop Ronaldo's header, which came in an unpredictable direction. — Ohhh?! It's in! Real Madrid's goal! Cristiano Ronaldo! He has opened Bayern Munich's goal with a header based on his incredible jumping power! — What an amazing goal? Bayern Munich, who had been solid throughout the game, has conceded a goal like this. — This is Cristiano Ronaldo's ability. A player who can create goals in any situation. He's showing why he's one of the world's best players. After scoring and making it 3-1, Real Madrid continued to focus on attacking. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich concentrated on defense. They substituted Shin Jaewook and Franck Ribéry, who had run a lot throughout the game, and brought in two players good at defense. \\"Shin Jaewook, you worked hard. You're being substituted for the next game.\\" \\"I know.\\" Shin Jaewook exchanged a light hug with coach Guardiola, who explained the reason for the substitution, and then checked the remaining time. There wasn't much time left until the end of the game. 'It won't be a comeback.' It was a time when he could feel relieved. Of course, Real Madrid, with their momentum, was a team that could create miracles, but that was only possible when there was time. 'I hope everyone keeps up the strength until the end and finishes without conceding any more goals.' Afterward, with not much time remaining, Bayern Munich focused solely on defense. Facing Bayern Munich, who were openly only defending, Real Madrid couldn't create any opportunities. Whistle! — The first leg of the Champions League semi-final is over! Bayern Munich wins 3-1, increasing their chances of reaching the final! — It wasn't a good game for Real Madrid, right? Since it was a home game, they had to win. Now, Real Madrid needs to score many goals in the second leg to advance to the final. The second leg between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich approached quickly. It was just a week away. — Both teams are entering the stadium! Bayern Munich, in a favorable position after winning 3-1 in the first leg, and Real Madrid, who must win! Which team will advance to the final? — We can't predict the result, but looking at recent games, Bayern Munich's atmosphere seems better than Real Madrid's. Real Madrid drew in their league game a few days ago, while Bayern Munich achieved a big win against Werder Bremen in the league three days ago, right? — That's right. They showed incredible firepower and won 6-2. In that game, Shin Jaewook even scored a hat-trick. — With striker Shin Jaewook's scoring sense at its peak, will he be able to score in the second leg against Real Madrid? We're looking forward to it! The second leg between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. Just before the game unfolded, many soccer fans were convinced. Bayern Munich, who had won 3-1 in the first leg and would play the second leg at their home stadium, would advance to the final. └ Statistically speaking, Bayern Munich has to advance to the final. They have the home advantage and a 2-point lead in the score. That's a huge difference for teams of this level. └ I also think Bayern Munich will win. Their recent momentum is too strong. Especially Shin Jaewook! He's just insane. └ Bayern Munich, with the monster Shin Jaewook, will go to the final. └ Let's think about it simply. Can Real Madrid's defense stop Shin Jaewook, Lee Taekhyun, and Franck Ribéry? I don't think so. We all saw it in the first leg, right? └ Real Madrid has the world's best firepower, but this season's Bayern Munich is a team of a different dimension. Did you know? Bayern Munich is currently on a 32-game winning streak in the league. └ No matter how good Real Madrid is, how can they beat a team on a 32-game winning streak? Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and Gareth Bale didn't do much in the first leg. Only Ronaldo scored one goal, but that was it. └ Bayern Munich will advance to the final. And they'll win the championship without much difficulty. This season is completely Bayern Munich's world. Such reactions from soccer fans weren't strange. Bayern Munich's momentum was that strong. But as the game started, something happened that defied the expectations of soccer fans worldwide. — The movement of Real Madrid's players today is too good, right? Their attack is really sharp! Real Madrid, right from the start of the game, pressed Bayern Munich hard with strong pressure and aggressive attacks, and eventually scored a goal. Moreover, the goal scorer was the defender Sergio Ramos. — Sergio Ramos! He scores the opening goal with a fantastic header! — This player isn't particularly tall, but he's very good at scoring with headers! Sergio Ramos shows his aerial duel ability even against Bayern Munich! — He's not called a goal-scoring defender for nothing~! It was Sergio Ramos's goal before even 15 minutes of the first half had passed. The surprised Bayern Munich players tried to manage the game calmly, but they struggled against Real Madrid's pressure, based on excellent skills and strong determination. A few minutes later, Real Madrid, riding the momentum, created another opportunity. — Corner kick! Gareth Bale has managed to earn a corner kick! — Contrary to many fans' and experts' expectations, Bayern Munich is being pushed back too much from the beginning of the game, right? We can't take it lightly now. Real Madrid is a very strong team in set pieces, and we must never forget that! The goal that just happened came from a set-piece situation too. Gareth Bale's corner kick. Luka Modrić took the kick. Boom! True to Modrić's reputation for kick accuracy, the ball flew with a sharp trajectory into Bayern Munich's penalty box. Both teams maintained high concentration. In that situation, the player who met the ball with his head was Sergio Ramos. — Wowwww! It's a goal! It's Sergio Ramos again! Sergio Ramos scores another header goal! — Wow! This is big, right? Bayern Munich must be shocked by conceding two goals to a defender, not even a forward! — Sergio Ramos! He's saving the team! Is Real Madrid creating a miracle? Two goals conceded before even 20 minutes of the first half had passed. And both goals came from similar situations. It was a painful situation for Bayern Munich. It was enough to instantly drop the morale of the players, and indeed, the good momentum of the Bayern Munich players disappeared in an instant. 'This is... dangerous?' Shin Jaewook's expression turned serious. Although he had always performed well in many games and never lost confidence, he had not been without defeats. That's why he knew. The current atmosphere was very dangerous for the team. It was heading towards a mood that could lead to defeat. 'Real Madrid's momentum has become too strong. We need to break the flow somehow.' Shin Jaewook shouted to his teammates. He said everything that was needed in the current situation: to stay focused, not to lose their assigned opponents until the end, to talk about the details that were lacking, and that they needed to press harder to break the opponent's flow. The Bayern Munich teammates nodded. They all knew the special qualities Shin Jaewook possessed, so no one raised any objections. 'Let's trust him. Shin Jaewook may have less experience, but he reads the game better than veteran players.' 'If Shin Jaewook says so, then that's how it is.' 'Let's do as he says. We've won every time we've listened to him, right?' 'Jaewook has never been wrong.' Bayern Munich was trailing 0-2 within 20 minutes of the first half. They were losing in momentum, and the atmosphere had completely shifted to Real Madrid's side. In that situation, the game resumed."},{"instruction":"177 * * * 고작 전반 20분밖에 안 됐지만. 경기의 분위기는 완전히 레알 마드리드 측으로 넘어갔다. 짧은 시간에 터진 2개의 골 때문이었다. ― 역시 레알 마드리드는 레알 마드리드네요! 1차전에서 그렇게 밀렸던 팀 맞습니까? 2차전에선 완전히 다른 모습을 보여주고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로 벌써 2 대 0입니다! 다른 팀도 아니고 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로요! ― 정말 놀랍습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨이 이렇게 밀리는 건 정말 보기 힘들거든요? 리그에서도 이렇게 밀렸던 경기가 없지 않습니까? ― 적어도 이번 시즌엔 없다고 봐도 되죠! 거의 모든 경기에서 압도했으면 했지, 밀리진 않았었거든요! 그런데 그런 바이에른 뮌헨이 챔피언스리그 4강 2차전에선 굉장히 힘든 경기를 치르고 있습니다! 모두가 예상하지 못했던 상황이었고. 실시간으로 경기를 지켜보던 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 흥분을 가라앉히지 못하고 있었다. └ 으하하하! 이게 레알 마드리드다!!!!!!! 바이에른 뮌헨은 1차전에 운이 좋았을 뿐이야! 오늘의 레알 마드리드가 진짜라고! └ 봤지? 다들 봤지? 이게 레알 마드리드의 실력이야! 레알 마드리드는 세계 최고의 팀이라고! └ 세르히오 라모스가 왜 세계 최고의 수비수인지 알겠냐? 얜 공격수보다도 골을 더 잘 넣거든! └ 큭큭! 라모스가 바이에른 뮌헨을 부숴버리고 있어! 오늘 레알 마드리드 너무 잘하는데? └ 챔피언스리그 결승엔 레알 마드리드가 진출하겠군! └ 그 바이에른 뮌헨도 레알 마드리드 앞에선 어쩔 수 없구나! └ 레알 마드리드가 1차전에서의 복수를 하기 시작했군! └ 세르히오 라모스의 헤더는 알고도 막기 어렵지! 같은 시각. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 당황하고 있었다. 전반전 20분 만에 2개의 실점을 허용하게 됐다는 사실에 평정심을 유지하지 못했다. 그런데 이들은 억지로라도 평정심을 되찾기 위해 노력했다. 현재의 팀 상황을 파악한 채로 보완할 점을 알려주는 신재욱 덕이었다. ― 신재욱 선수가 동료들에게 무언가를 열심히 말하고 있네요? ― 자주 있는 일은 아니지만, 팀의 분위기가 좋지 않을 때마다 신재욱 선수는 지금처럼 동료들에게 많은 이야기를 해주는 편이죠. 그리고 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 신재욱 선수의 말을 굉장히 잘 듣는 편이라고 합니다. 팀에서 가장 어린 선수였지만, 가장 많은 골을 넣는 선수. 더구나 경험이 가장 적으면서 가장 베테랑처럼 축구 하는 선수. 그런 신재욱의 말이었기에 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 집중력을 끌어올릴 수 있었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 빠르게 안정감을 되찾고 있는 것처럼 보이죠? ― 정말 그렇네요. 분명 선수들이 당황한 것처럼 보였었는데 말이죠? 신재욱 선수의 말들이 효과가 있었던 걸까요? 레알 마드리드는 계속해서 바이에른 뮌헨을 몰아붙였다. 초반부터 잡은 기세를 놓치지 않겠다는 듯, 공격을 멈추지 않았다. 바쁘게 몰아치는 공격이었음에도 날카로움이 그대로 담겨 있었다. 그런데 바이에른 뮌헨이 잘 버텨냈다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비가 좋은데요? 선수들이 흔들리지 않습니다! 초반에 2골을 허용했을 때와는 경기력이 달라진 것 같습니다! ― 이게 바이에른 뮌헨이죠! 이제야 진짜 바이에른 뮌헨답네요! 분데스리가에서 보여주던 단단한 수비를 보여주며 레알 마드리드의 공격을 효과적으로 방어했다. 게다가 이제는 날카로운 역습까지 시도했다. 투웅! 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거가 필립 람에게 공을 넘겼고. 필립 람은 부드럽게 공을 컨트롤한 뒤, 좋은 위치에 있던 토마스 뮐러에게 패스를 보냈다. 이때 토마스 뮐러는 공을 끌지 않았다. 욕심을 부리지 않고, 오늘은 공격형 미드필더로 출전한 이택현에게 공을 넘겼다. ― 이택현 선수가 공을 받습니다! 오늘 누구도 예상하지 못한 공격형 미드필더로 출전을 한 이택현 선수인데, 아직까진 무언가를 보여줄 기회가 없었거든요? 하지만 이제는 기회가 온 것 같습니다! 명장인 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 이택현 선수를 공격형 미드필더로 투입한 이유를 보여주면 좋겠네요! 이때 이택현은 모두를 놀라게 할 플레이를 보여줬다. ― 이택현 선수! 과감합니다! 과감한 패스를 찔러넣습니다! 토마스 뮐러에게서 공을 받자마자 시도한 스루패스. 뻗어져 나간 공엔 날이 제대로 서 있었다. 워낙 빠른 타이밍에 나온 패스였고, 정확도도 완벽에 가까웠다. 공은 단숨에 신재욱의 발 앞에 도착했다. ― 어느새 페널티박스 안으로 침투한 신재욱 선수가 공을 잡았습니다! 너무 좋은 기회죠! 상대의 페널티박스 안에서 안정적으로 공을 받은 상황. 더구나 다리를 휘둘러 슈팅할 타이밍도 충분히 나왔다. 휘익! 신재욱이 다리를 휘둘렀다. 골키퍼가 막기 어려운 상단 구석을 노린 슈팅이었다. ― 고오오오오올! 골입니다! 드디어 바이에른 뮌헨의 골이 터졌습니다! ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 패스 플레이가 너무 좋았네요! 특히 마지막에 이택현 선수의 킬패스는 정말 날카로웠습니다! ― 이택현 선수가 공격형 미드필더로서도 재능이 있었군요? 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 이런 중요한 경기에서 이택현 선수를 공격형 미드필더로 출전시킨 이유가 있었습니다! 이택현 선수, 패스의 타이밍과 정교함이 대단합니다! ― 신재욱 선수의 퍼스트 터치와 슈팅도 완벽했습니다! 골을 넣은 신재욱은 좋은 패스를 준 이택현에게 엄지를 들어 올리며 고마운 마음을 드러냈다. “택현아, 패스 좋더라. 덕분에 편하게 골 넣을 수 있었어.” “흐흐! 타이밍이 예술이었지? 그 타이밍에 패스하면 네가 바로 골 넣어줄 거 같았어. 하! 이거 이러다가 평생 공격형 미드필더로만 나오게 되는 거 아니야? 난 윙어로 뛰는 걸 더 좋아하는데…….” “자만하진 말고, 전반전이 끝나기 전까지 한 골 더 만들어보자.” “좋아! 완전히 달콤한 패스로 줄 테니까 기대해! 재욱아 내가 완벽하게 만들어줄 테니까 넌 그냥 골을 잘 넣기만 해줘.” “골 넣는 건 내 전문이지.” “좀 재수 없지만 맞는 말이긴 해. 분데스리가 득점왕이니까.” 신재욱은 이택현과의 대화를 마친 뒤, 다른 동료들과도 짧은 대화를 나눴다. 이어서 그는 관중석에 가득한 팬들을 바라보며 함성을 유도했다. ― 팬들의 함성이 굉장합니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 홈구장답네요! 홈팬들이 신재욱 선수에게 커다란 함성을 보내고 있습니다! ― 이거 경기가 어떻게 흘러갈지 예상이 안 되는데요? 과연 결승전에 오를 팀은 어디가 될지 궁금하네요! 신재욱의 골 이후. 더욱 공격적으로 나온 팀은 레알 마드리드였다. 한 골을 허용했지만, 초반에 좋았던 기세를 뺏기고 싶지 않았기에 나온 경기 운영이었다. 그리고 그 사실을 신재욱은 누구보다도 빠르게 파악해냈다. “쟤들 지금 마음 급해요! 빠르게 한 골 넣어서 경기를 유리하게 이끌고 싶은 것 같은데, 우린 그냥 라인 내리고 침착하게 막고 역습하면 돼요! 가레스 베일이랑 크리스티아누 호날두의 스피드는 계속 경계하고, 루카 모드리치와 사비 알론소가 편하게 패스하지 못하게 강하게 압박해줘요!” 레알 마드리드에겐 너무나도 얄밉게 느껴지는 말이었지만, 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들에겐 시험에서 정답지를 보게 된 듯한 느낌을 받았을 정도로 든든한 말이었다. 그래서일까? 바이에른 뮌헨은 남은 시간 동안 웅크린 채 레알 마드리드의 위험한 공격들을 잘 막아내는 것에 성공했다. ― 전반전이 2 대 1로 종료됩니다! 레알 마드리드가 추가 득점을 노려봤지만, 바이에른 뮌헨이 기회를 주지 않았네요! ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 2골을 실점한 이후로는 단단한 경기력을 보여줬죠. 반면 레알 마드리드는 하나의 실점이 아쉽게 느껴질 것 같습니다. 분위기가 너무 좋은 상황에서 골을 허용한 것이거든요. 후반전은 치열했다. 레알 마드리드가 적극적으로 공격을 펼쳤고, 바이에른 뮌헨도 침착한 수비와 강한 압박을 바탕으로 경기를 풀어나갔다. ― 크리스티아누 호날두가 침투해봤지만, 오프사이드가 선언됐습니다! 방금은 바이에른 뮌헨의 오프사이드 트랩이 좋았죠? ― 맞습니다. 오늘 크리스티아누 호날두 선수가 오프사이드에 많이 걸리네요. 그만큼 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비진이 오프사이드 트랩을 잘 활용하고 있다는 거겠죠. 확실히 벤제마, 베일, 호날두로 이뤄진 레알 마드리드의 공격진은 강력했지만. 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진도 만만치 않게 강했다. 특히 신재욱이 공을 잡을 때면 레알 마드리드의 수비수들이 잔뜩 긴장했다. 1차전에 워낙 크게 당했었고, 오늘도 계속해서 위협적인 움직임을 보여주고 있었기 때문이었다. 지금도 그랬다. ― 신재욱 선수가 공을 받습니다! 오늘 경기 내내 아주 좋은 볼 키핑 능력을 보여준 신재욱 선수인데, 이번에도 공을 지켜낼 수 있을까요? 신재욱은 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거가 강하게 보낸 패스를 안전하게 받아냈고, 상대 수비수를 등졌다. 레알 마드리드의 주전선수이자 세계적인 수비수인 페페가 바싹 달라붙어서 압박을 해왔지만, 신재욱은 전혀 당황하지 않고 버텨냈다. ― 신재욱! 페페와의 몸싸움에서 밀리지 않습니다! 아~! 신재욱 선수! 공을 정말 안 뺏겨요! 페페는 필사적이었다. 옷을 잡고, 힘을 쓰며 발을 뻗었다. 조금은 지저분하다고 느껴질 정도로 수비에 집중했다. 그런데도 신재욱은 뺏기지 않았다. 영리하게 페페를 등진 채, 적절하게 페인팅을 써가며 공을 지켜냈다. 더구나 공을 지키기만 한 건 아니었다. 신재욱은 공을 지켜내며 동료들의 움직임을 놓치지 않았다. 여전히 페페에게 압박받는 상황에서. 휘익! 신재욱은 계속해서 몸을 움직이며 페페의 심리를 복잡하게 만들었다. 그리고 이제는 왼쪽으로 몸을 돌릴 것처럼 회전한 뒤. 툭! 휙! 오른쪽으로 몸을 돌렸다. 동시에 왼발로 공을 강하게 감아 찼다. 몸을 완전히 틀면서 차낸 공이 레알 마드리드의 페널티박스 안으로 휘어져 들어갔다. 레알 마드리드의 오프사이드 트랩을 뚫고 침투한 토마스 뮐러를 노린 패스였다. ― 우오오오! 좋은 패스입니다! 경기를 지켜보던 사람들이 깜짝 놀랄 정도로 예리한 패스였다. 토마스 뮐러는 일말의 망설임도 없이 몸을 던졌다. 다이빙 헤더. 자칫 다칠 수도 있는 슈팅 방법이었지만, 지금과 같은 상황에선 가장 효율적인 방법이었다. ― 우와아아아! 들어갔습니다! 토마스 뮐러! 몸을 날린 다이빙 헤더로 동점 골을 터트립니다! ― 와……이건 토마스 뮐러 선수의 침투도 좋았지만, 신재욱 선수의 플레이가 정말 좋았죠! 최전방에서 페페를 상대로 공을 지켜내면서 놀라울 정도로 예리한 패스까지 뿌려냈거든요? ― 신재욱 선수가 완성형 스트라이커가 뭔지를 제대로 보여주는 것 같습니다. 스트라이커는 꼭 골을 넣지 않더라도 방금 신재욱 선수가 했던 것처럼 최전방에서 공을 지켜주고, 버텨주는 플레이를 잘해주면 팀에 큰 도움이 되거든요! 이런 포스트 플레이는 상대 팀인 카림 벤제마 선수도 굉장히 잘하는 건데, 오늘만큼은 신재욱 선수의 포스트 플레이가 더 빛나고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 홈구장 알리안츠 아레나의 분위기가 뜨겁게 달아올랐다. 이곳을 가득 메운 바이에른 뮌헨은 팬들은 기쁨을 가라앉히지 못했다. 2 대 0으로 밀렸던 바이에른 뮌헨이 기어코 동점을 만들어냈으니까. 그러나 이들의 기쁨은 오래가지 못했다. 토마스 뮐러의 골이 터진 지 겨우 4분 뒤. 세계 최고의 선수 중 하나이자, 레알 마드리드의 에이스인 크리스티아누 호날두의 골이 터졌으니까.","output":"177 --- It had only been 20 minutes into the first half. But the atmosphere of the game had completely shifted to Real Madrid's side. It was because of the two goals scored in a short time. — Real Madrid is indeed Real Madrid! Are they the same team that was pushed back in the first leg? In the second leg, they're showing a completely different performance! They're already leading 2-0 against Bayern Munich! Against Bayern Munich of all teams! — It's really surprising! It's very rare to see Bayern Munich being pushed back like this, right? There hasn't been a game where they were pushed back in the league, has there? — At least not this season! They've dominated almost every game, never being pushed back! But now, Bayern Munich is having a very tough game in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals! It was a situation that no one had anticipated, and the Real Madrid fans watching the game live couldn't contain their excitement. └ Hahaha! This is Real Madrid!!!!!!! Bayern Munich was just lucky in the first leg! Today's Real Madrid is the real deal! └ Did you see that? Did everyone see that? This is the strength of Real Madrid! Real Madrid is the best team in the world! └ Do you see why Sergio Ramos is considered one of the world's best defenders? He scores goals better than some forwards! └ Keke! Ramos is tearing Bayern Munich apart! Real Madrid is playing so well today, right? └ Real Madrid will advance to the Champions League final! └ Even Bayern Munich can't do anything in front of Real Madrid! └ Real Madrid has started to take revenge for the first leg! └ Sergio Ramos's headers are hard to stop even when you know they're coming! At the same time. The Bayern Munich players were in a state of panic. They couldn't maintain their composure after conceding two goals in just 20 minutes of the first half. But they tried to regain their composure, thanks to Shin Jaewook, who pointed out what needed to be improved based on the current team situation. — Shin Jaewook is saying something earnestly to his teammates? — It's not common, but whenever the team's atmosphere is not good, Shin Jaewook talks a lot to his teammates like now. And the Bayern Munich players listen very well to what Shin Jaewook says. Despite being the youngest player on the team, he was the one who scored the most goals. Moreover, he was the player with the least experience but played soccer like a veteran. Because of Shin Jaewook's words, the Bayern Munich players were able to raise their concentration. — Bayern Munich seems to be quickly regaining stability, right? — Really, it looked like the players were flustered, right? Maybe Shin Jaewook's words had an effect? Real Madrid continued to press Bayern Munich. They didn't stop attacking, as if they didn't want to lose the momentum they had gained from the beginning. Despite the frantic pace of the attacks, they retained their sharpness. But Bayern Munich held on well. — Bayern Munich's defense is good, right? The players are not shaken! It seems like their performance has changed since they conceded two goals at the beginning! — This is Bayern Munich! Now they're finally playing like the real Bayern Munich! They showed the solid defense that they had displayed in the Bundesliga and effectively defended against Real Madrid's attacks. And now they even attempted sharp counterattacks. Thwack! Bastian Schweinsteiger passed the ball to Philipp Lahm. Lahm controlled the ball smoothly and then sent a pass to Thomas Müller, who was in a good position. At that moment, Thomas Müller didn't hold onto the ball. Without being greedy, he passed the ball to Lee Taekhyun, who had started the game as an attacking midfielder. — Lee Taekhyun receives the ball! He's playing as an attacking midfielder today, which no one expected, and he hasn't had a chance to show anything yet, right? But now it seems like his opportunity has come! It would be great if he could show why coach Josep Guardiola put him in as an attacking midfielder! At that moment, Lee Taekhyun made a play that surprised everyone. — Lee Taekhyun! He's bold! He sends a daring pass! A through pass attempted immediately after receiving the ball from Thomas Müller. The pass was sharp and precise. It was so timely and accurate that the ball quickly arrived at Shin Jaewook's feet. — Shin Jaewook has received the ball inside the penalty box! It's a great opportunity! In a situation where he received the ball stably inside the opponent's penalty box. And he had enough time to swing his leg for a shot. Swoosh! Shin Jaewook swung his leg. It was a shot aimed at the difficult-to-reach top corner of the goal. — Goooooal! It's a goal! Finally, Bayern Munich has scored! — Bayern Munich's passing play was too good! Especially the last killer pass from Lee Taekhyun was really sharp! — Lee Taekhyun has talent as an attacking midfielder too? There was a reason why coach Josep Guardiola put him in as an attacking midfielder for such an important game! Lee Taekhyun, the timing and precision of his pass are amazing! — Shin Jaewook's first touch and shot were also perfect! After scoring, Shin Jaewook raised his thumb to Lee Taekhyun, expressing his gratitude for the good pass. \\"Taekhyun, that was a good pass. Thanks to you, I could score comfortably.\\" \\"Hehe! The timing was artistic, right? I felt like if I passed it at that moment, you would score right away. Ha! At this rate, am I going to end up playing as an attacking midfielder forever? I prefer playing as a winger...\\" \\"Don't get cocky, let's try to create one more goal before the first half ends.\\" \\"Alright! I'll give you a perfectly sweet pass, so look forward to it! Jaewook, I'll set it up perfectly, so you just need to score well.\\" \\"Scoring is my specialty.\\" \\"It's a bit annoying, but it's true. You're the Bundesliga's top scorer, after all.\\" After finishing the conversation with Lee Taekhyun, Shin Jaewook also had brief exchanges with other teammates. Then he looked at the fans filling the stands and encouraged their cheers. — The cheers from the fans are tremendous! It's fitting for Bayern Munich's home stadium! The home fans are sending a huge cheer to Shin Jaewook! — It's unpredictable how the game will go, right? I wonder which team will advance to the final! After Shin Jaewook's goal. The team that came out more aggressively was Real Madrid. They had conceded a goal but didn't want to lose the good momentum they had at the beginning, so they managed the game accordingly. And Shin Jaewook was the quickest to grasp that fact. \\"They're in a hurry now! They want to score quickly to take the lead in the game, but we just need to lower our line, stay calm, defend, and counterattack! Keep an eye on Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo's speed, and press hard so Luka Modrić and Xabi Alonso can't pass comfortably!\\" It was a statement that would have been very annoying to Real Madrid, but to the Bayern Munich players, it felt as reassuring as seeing the answer sheet in an exam. Perhaps that's why? Bayern Munich successfully defended against Real Madrid's dangerous attacks for the remaining time. — The first half ends 2-1! Real Madrid tried to score additional goals, but Bayern Munich didn't give them a chance! — After conceding two goals, Bayern Munich showed a solid performance. On the other hand, Real Madrid might feel regretful about the one goal they conceded. They allowed a goal when the atmosphere was so favorable. The second half was intense. Real Madrid aggressively attacked, and Bayern Munich managed the game with calm defense and strong pressure. — Cristiano Ronaldo tried to penetrate but was called offside! Just now, Bayern Munich's offside trap was good, right? — That's right. Cristiano Ronaldo has been caught offside a lot today. It means that Bayern Munich's defense is using the offside trap well. Certainly, Real Madrid's attacking line, consisting of Benzema, Bale, and Ronaldo, was powerful. But Bayern Munich's attacking line was also not to be underestimated. Especially when Shin Jaewook had the ball, Real Madrid's defenders were extremely tense. They had been significantly affected in the first leg, and even today, he continued to show threatening movements. It was the same now. — Shin Jaewook receives the ball! He's been showing very good ball-keeping ability throughout today's game, but will he be able to keep it this time? Shin Jaewook safely received a strong pass from Bastian Schweinsteiger and turned his back on the opposing defender. Pepe, Real Madrid's main player and a world-class defender, pressed him closely, but Shin Jaewook was not flustered and held on. — Shin Jaewook! He doesn't lose the physical battle with Pepe! Ah~! Shin Jaewook really doesn't lose the ball! Pepe was desperate. He grabbed clothes, used strength, and stretched out his legs. He focused on defense to the point that it felt a bit dirty. But Shin Jaewook didn't lose the ball. Cleverly keeping Pepe on his back, he used feints appropriately to keep the ball. Moreover, he didn't just keep the ball. While keeping the ball, Shin Jaewook didn't miss his teammates' movements. Even while still being pressured by Pepe. Swoosh! Shin Jaewook kept moving, complicating Pepe's psychology, and then, as if he was going to turn left, he spun around. Thump! Swoosh! He turned to the right and kicked the ball hard with his left foot. The ball, kicked while completely turning his body, curved into Real Madrid's penalty box. It was a pass aimed at Thomas Müller, who had broken through Real Madrid's offside trap. — Wow! That's a good pass! It was a pass so sharp that it surprised the spectators. Thomas Müller threw himself at the ball without hesitation. A diving header. It was a shooting method that could be risky, but in the current situation, it was the most efficient method. — Wowwww! It's in! Thomas Müller! He scores the equalizing goal with a diving header! — Wow... That was a good run by Thomas Müller, but Shin Jaewook's play was really good! He kept the ball against Pepe at the front and even delivered a surprisingly sharp pass? — Shin Jaewook seems to be showing what a complete striker is. A striker doesn't always have to score goals; just like Shin Jaewook did just now, keeping the ball at the front and holding on is a great help to the team! This kind of post play is also something Karim Benzema of the opposing team is very good at, but today, Shin Jaewook's post play is shining even more! The atmosphere at Bayern Munich's home stadium, Allianz Arena, was heated. The Bayern Munich fans filling the place couldn't contain their joy. Bayern Munich, who had been trailing 2-0, had managed to equalize. But their joy didn't last long. Just 4 minutes after Thomas Müller's goal. A goal by one of the world's best players and Real Madrid's ace, Cristiano Ronaldo, was scored."},{"instruction":"Write in simple eng just refime with minor modification keep it upto 600 wrds keep headinfs same use h2 headings in unique sentences - What is Functional Medicine and How Can It Help You?

Functional medicine is a way of looking after your health that focuses on finding and fixing the real reasons you're sick, not just making the symptoms go away. It's like playing detective with your health by closely looking at your medical history and the many things that can impact your health, such as your genes, the environment, and how you live your life. Functional medicine wants to help your body heal itself and keep you healthy over time, not just treat you when you're sick. # Key Ideas Behind Functional Medicine Functional medicine is built on a few important ideas: Every Person is Unique Think of it like this: each person is a one-of-a-kind puzzle. Our genes, our body's chemistry, and our life stories are all pieces of that puzzle. Functional medicine is like coming up with a perfect plan to solve that puzzle, taking into account every little piece that makes you who you are. Understanding the Whole Body Our bodies are made up of a bunch of connected parts that all work together. Functional medicine looks at the whole picture of a person's health, seeing how every part of the body affects the others. It even takes into account things from outside the body, like what you eat, how much you stress, the bad stuff in the environment, and sicknesses that can mess with your health.

2차전에선 완전히 다른 모습을 보여주고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로 벌써 2 대 0입니다! 다른 팀도 아니고 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대로요! ― 정말 놀랍습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨이 이렇게 밀리는 건 정말 보기 힘들거든요? 리그에서도 이렇게 밀렸던 경기가 없지 않습니까? ― 적어도 이번 시즌엔 없다고 봐도 되죠! 거의 모든 경기에서 압도했으면 했지, 밀리진 않았었거든요! 그런데 그런 바이에른 뮌헨이 챔피언스리그 4강 2차전에선 굉장히 힘든 경기를 치르고 있습니다! 모두가 예상하지 못했던 상황이었고. 실시간으로 경기를 지켜보던 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 흥분을 가라앉히지 못하고 있었다. └ 으하하하! 이게 레알 마드리드다!!! 바이에른 뮌헨은 1차전에 운이 좋았을 뿐이야! 오늘의 레알 마드리드가 진짜라고! └ 봤지? 다들 봤지? 이게 레알 마드리드의 실력이야! 레알 마드리드는 세계 최고의 팀이라고! └ 세르히오 라모스가 왜 세계 최고의 수비수인지 알겠냐? 얜 공격수보다도 골을 더 잘 넣거든! └ 큭큭! 라모스가 바이에른 뮌헨을 부숴버리고 있어! 오늘 레알 마드리드 너무 잘하는데? └ 챔피언스리그 결승엔 레알 마드리드가 진출하겠군! └ 그 바이에른 뮌헨도 레알 마드리드 앞에선 어쩔 수 없구나! └ 레알 마드리드가 1차전에서의 복수를 하기 시작했군! └ 세르히오 라모스의 헤더는 알고도 막기 어렵지! 같은 시각. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 당황하고 있었다. 전반전 20분 만에 2개의 실점을 허용하게 됐다는 사실에 평정심을 유지하지 못했다. 그런데 이들은 억지로라도 평정심을 되찾기 위해 노력했다. 현재의 팀 상황을 파악한 채로 보완할 점을 알려주는 신재욱 덕이었다. ― 신재욱 선수가 동료들에게 무언가를 열심히 말하고 있네요? ― 자주 있는 일은 아니지만, 팀의 분위기가 좋지 않을 때마다 신재욱 선수는 지금처럼 동료들에게 많은 이야기를 해주는 편이죠. 그리고 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 신재욱 선수의 말을 굉장히 잘 듣는 편이라고 합니다. 팀에서 가장 어린 선수였지만, 가장 많은 골을 넣는 선수. 더구나 경험이 가장 적으면서 가장 베테랑처럼 축구 하는 선수. 그런 신재욱의 말이었기에 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 집중력을 끌어올릴 수 있었다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 빠르게 안정감을 되찾고 있는 것처럼 보이죠? ― 정말 그렇네요. 분명 선수들이 당황한 것처럼 보였었는데 말이죠? 신재욱 선수의 말들이 효과가 있었던 걸까요? 레알 마드리드는 계속해서 바이에른 뮌헨을 몰아붙였다. 초반부터 잡은 기세를 놓치지 않겠다는 듯, 공격을 멈추지 않았다. 바쁘게 몰아치는 공격이었음에도 날카로움이 그대로 담겨 있었다. 그런데 바이에른 뮌헨이 잘 버텨냈다. ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비가 좋은데요? 선수들이 흔들리지 않습니다! 초반에 2골을 허용했을 때와는 경기력이 달라진 것 같습니다! ― 이게 바이에른 뮌헨이죠! 이제야 진짜 바이에른 뮌헨답네요! 분데스리가에서 보여주던 단단한 수비를 보여주며 레알 마드리드의 공격을 효과적으로 방어했다. 게다가 이제는 날카로운 역습까지 시도했다. 투웅! 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거가 필립 람에게 공을 넘겼고. 필립 람은 부드럽게 공을 컨트롤한 뒤, 좋은 위치에 있던 토마스 뮐러에게 패스를 보냈다. 이때 토마스 뮐러는 공을 끌지 않았다. 욕심을 부리지 않고, 오늘은 공격형 미드필더로 출전한 이택현에게 공을 넘겼다. ― 이택현 선수가 공을 받습니다! 오늘 누구도 예상하지 못한 공격형 미드필더로 출전을 한 이택현 선수인데, 아직까진 무언가를 보여줄 기회가 없었거든요? 하지만 이제는 기회가 온 것 같습니다! 명장인 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 이택현 선수를 공격형 미드필더로 투입한 이유를 보여주면 좋겠네요! 이때 이택현은 모두를 놀라게 할 플레이를 보여줬다. ― 이택현 선수! 과감합니다! 과감한 패스를 찔러넣습니다! 토마스 뮐러에게서 공을 받자마자 시도한 스루패스. 뻗어져 나간 공엔 날이 제대로 서 있었다. 워낙 빠른 타이밍에 나온 패스였고, 정확도도 완벽에 가까웠다. 공은 단숨에 신재욱의 발 앞에 도착했다. ― 어느새 페널티박스 안으로 침투한 신재욱 선수가 공을 잡았습니다! 너무 좋은 기회죠! 상대의 페널티박스 안에서 안정적으로 공을 받은 상황. 더구나 다리를 휘둘러 슈팅할 타이밍도 충분히 나왔다. 휘익! 신재욱이 다리를 휘둘렀다. 골키퍼가 막기 어려운 상단 구석을 노린 슈팅이었다. ― 고오오오오올! 골입니다! 드디어 바이에른 뮌헨의 골이 터졌습니다! ― 바이에른 뮌헨의 패스 플레이가 너무 좋았네요! 특히 마지막에 이택현 선수의 킬패스는 정말 날카로웠습니다! ― 이택현 선수가 공격형 미드필더로서도 재능이 있었군요? 호셉 과르디올라 감독이 이런 중요한 경기에서 이택현 선수를 공격형 미드필더로 출전시킨 이유가 있었습니다! 이택현 선수, 패스의 타이밍과 정교함이 대단합니다! ― 신재욱 선수의 퍼스트 터치와 슈팅도 완벽했습니다! 골을 넣은 신재욱은 좋은 패스를 준 이택현에게 엄지를 들어 올리며 고마운 마음을 드러냈다. “택현아, 패스 좋더라. 덕분에 편하게 골 넣을 수 있었어.” “흐흐! 타이밍이 예술이었지? 그 타이밍에 패스하면 네가 바로 골 넣어줄 거 같았어. 하! 이거 이러다가 평생 공격형 미드필더로만 나오게 되는 거 아니야? 난 윙어로 뛰는 걸 더 좋아하는데…….” “자만하진 말고, 전반전이 끝나기 전까지 한 골 더 만들어보자.” “좋아! 완전히 달콤한 패스로 줄 테니까 기대해! 재욱아 내가 완벽하게 만들어줄 테니까 넌 그냥 골을 잘 넣기만 해줘.” “골 넣는 건 내 전문이지.” “좀 재수 없지만 맞는 말이긴 해. 분데스리가 득점왕이니까.” 신재욱은 이택현과의 대화를 마친 뒤, 다른 동료들과도 짧은 대화를 나눴다. 이어서 그는 관중석에 가득한 팬들을 바라보며 함성을 유도했다. ― 팬들의 함성이 굉장합니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 홈구장답네요! 홈팬들이 신재욱 선수에게 커다란 함성을 보내고 있습니다! ― 이거 경기가 어떻게 흘러갈지 예상이 안 되는데요? 과연 결승전에 오를 팀은 어디가 될지 궁금하네요! 신재욱의 골 이후. 더욱 공격적으로 나온 팀은 레알 마드리드였다. 한 골을 허용했지만, 초반에 좋았던 기세를 뺏기고 싶지 않았기에 나온 경기 운영이었다. 그리고 그 사실을 신재욱은 누구보다도 빠르게 파악해냈다. “쟤들 지금 마음 급해요! 빠르게 한 골 넣어서 경기를 유리하게 이끌고 싶은 것 같은데, 우린 그냥 라인 내리고 침착하게 막고 역습하면 돼요! 가레스 베일이랑 크리스티아누 호날두의 스피드는 계속 경계하고, 루카 모드리치와 사비 알론소가 편하게 패스하지 못하게 강하게 압박해줘요!” 레알 마드리드에겐 너무나도 얄밉게 느껴지는 말이었지만, 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들에겐 시험에서 정답지를 보게 된 듯한 느낌을 받았을 정도로 든든한 말이었다. 그래서일까? 바이에른 뮌헨은 남은 시간 동안 웅크린 채 레알 마드리드의 위험한 공격들을 잘 막아내는 것에 성공했다. ― 전반전이 2 대 1로 종료됩니다! 레알 마드리드가 추가 득점을 노려봤지만, 바이에른 뮌헨이 기회를 주지 않았네요! ― 바이에른 뮌헨이 2골을 실점한 이후로는 단단한 경기력을 보여줬죠. 반면 레알 마드리드는 하나의 실점이 아쉽게 느껴질 것 같습니다. 분위기가 너무 좋은 상황에서 골을 허용한 것이거든요. 후반전은 치열했다. 레알 마드리드가 적극적으로 공격을 펼쳤고, 바이에른 뮌헨도 침착한 수비와 강한 압박을 바탕으로 경기를 풀어나갔다. ― 크리스티아누 호날두가 침투해봤지만, 오프사이드가 선언됐습니다! 방금은 바이에른 뮌헨의 오프사이드 트랩이 좋았죠? ― 맞습니다. 오늘 크리스티아누 호날두 선수가 오프사이드에 많이 걸리네요. 그만큼 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비진이 오프사이드 트랩을 잘 활용하고 있다는 거겠죠. 확실히 벤제마, 베일, 호날두로 이뤄진 레알 마드리드의 공격진은 강력했지만. 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진도 만만치 않게 강했다. 특히 신재욱이 공을 잡을 때면 레알 마드리드의 수비수들이 잔뜩 긴장했다. 1차전에 워낙 크게 당했었고, 오늘도 계속해서 위협적인 움직임을 보여주고 있었기 때문이었다. 지금도 그랬다. ― 신재욱 선수가 공을 받습니다! 오늘 경기 내내 아주 좋은 볼 키핑 능력을 보여준 신재욱 선수인데, 이번에도 공을 지켜낼 수 있을까요? 신재욱은 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거가 강하게 보낸 패스를 안전하게 받아냈고, 상대 수비수를 등졌다. 레알 마드리드의 주전선수이자 세계적인 수비수인 페페가 바싹 달라붙어서 압박을 해왔지만, 신재욱은 전혀 당황하지 않고 버텨냈다. ― 신재욱! 페페와의 몸싸움에서 밀리지 않습니다! 아~! 신재욱 선수! 공을 정말 안 뺏겨요! 페페는 필사적이었다. 옷을 잡고, 힘을 쓰며 발을 뻗었다. 조금은 지저분하다고 느껴질 정도로 수비에 집중했다. 그런데도 신재욱은 뺏기지 않았다. 영리하게 페페를 등진 채, 적절하게 페인팅을 써가며 공을 지켜냈다. 더구나 공을 지키기만 한 건 아니었다. 신재욱은 공을 지켜내며 동료들의 움직임을 놓치지 않았다. 여전히 페페에게 압박받는 상황에서. 휘익! 신재욱은 계속해서 몸을 움직이며 페페의 심리를 복잡하게 만들었다. 그리고 이제는 왼쪽으로 몸을 돌릴 것처럼 회전한 뒤. 툭! 휙! 오른쪽으로 몸을 돌렸다. 동시에 왼발로 공을 강하게 감아 찼다. 몸을 완전히 틀면서 차낸 공이 레알 마드리드의 페널티박스 안으로 휘어져 들어갔다. 레알 마드리드의 오프사이드 트랩을 뚫고 침투한 토마스 뮐러를 노린 패스였다. ― 우오오오! 좋은 패스입니다! 경기를 지켜보던 사람들이 깜짝 놀랄 정도로 예리한 패스였다. 토마스 뮐러는 일말의 망설임도 없이 몸을 던졌다. 다이빙 헤더. 자칫 다칠 수도 있는 슈팅 방법이었지만, 지금과 같은 상황에선 가장 효율적인 방법이었다. ― 우와아아아! 들어갔습니다! 토마스 뮐러! 몸을 날린 다이빙 헤더로 동점 골을 터트립니다! ― 와……이건 토마스 뮐러 선수의 침투도 좋았지만, 신재욱 선수의 플레이가 정말 좋았죠! 최전방에서 페페를 상대로 공을 지켜내면서 놀라울 정도로 예리한 패스까지 뿌려냈거든요? ― 신재욱 선수가 완성형 스트라이커가 뭔지를 제대로 보여주는 것 같습니다. 스트라이커는 꼭 골을 넣지 않더라도 방금 신재욱 선수가 했던 것처럼 최전방에서 공을 지켜주고, 버텨주는 플레이를 잘해주면 팀에 큰 도움이 되거든요! 이런 포스트 플레이는 상대 팀인 카림 벤제마 선수도 굉장히 잘하는 건데, 오늘만큼은 신재욱 선수의 포스트 플레이가 더 빛나고 있습니다! 바이에른 뮌헨의 홈구장 알리안츠 아레나의 분위기가 뜨겁게 달아올랐다. 이곳을 가득 메운 바이에른 뮌헨은 팬들은 기쁨을 가라앉히지 못했다. 2 대 0으로 밀렸던 바이에른 뮌헨이 기어코 동점을 만들어냈으니까. 그러나 이들의 기쁨은 오래가지 못했다. 토마스 뮐러의 골이 터진 지 겨우 4분 뒤. 세계 최고의 선수 중 하나이자, 레알 마드리드의 에이스인 크리스티아누 호날두의 골이 터졌으니까.","output":"177 --- It's only been 20 minutes into the first half. But the atmosphere of the game has completely shifted in favor of Real Madrid. It was because of the two goals that were scored in a short period of time. - As expected, Real Madrid is Real Madrid! Are they really the same team that was pushed back in the first leg? In the second leg, they are showing a completely different side! They are already leading 2-0 against Bayern Munich! And it's not just any team, it's against Bayern Munich! - It's really amazing! It's really rare to see Bayern Munich being pushed back like this, isn't it? There haven't been any games where they were pushed back like this in the league, right? - At least not this season! They have dominated almost every game, they haven't been pushed back! But now, Bayern Munich is having a tough game in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals! It was a situation that no one had expected. Real Madrid fans watching the game live couldn't contain their excitement. - Hahaha! This is Real Madrid!!! Bayern Munich was just lucky in the first leg! Today's Real Madrid is the real deal! - Did you see? Did everyone see? This is the strength of Real Madrid! Real Madrid is the best team in the world! - Do you see why Sergio Ramos is the best defender in the world? He scores goals better than some forwards! - Keke! Ramos is crushing Bayern Munich! How well is Real Madrid playing today? - Real Madrid will advance to the Champions League final! - Even Bayern Munich can't do anything in front of Real Madrid! - Real Madrid has started to take revenge for the first leg! - Sergio Ramos's headers are hard to stop even if you know they're coming! At the same time. Bayern Munich players were in a state of panic. They couldn't maintain their composure after conceding two goals in just 20 minutes of the first half. However, they tried to regain their composure, thanks to <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, who pointed out what needed to be improved after assessing the current team situation. - Shin Jae-wook is talking earnestly to his teammates, isn't he? - It's not common, but whenever the team's atmosphere is not good, Shin Jae-wook talks a lot to his teammates like now. And the Bayern Munich players listen very well to Shin Jae-wook. The youngest player on the team, but the one who scores the most goals. Moreover, the player with the least experience but plays football like a veteran. Because it was Shin Jae-wook's words, the Bayern Munich players were able to raise their concentration. - It seems like Bayern Munich is quickly regaining stability, doesn't it? - Indeed. The players seemed to be in a panic, but maybe Shin Jae-wook's words had an effect? Real Madrid continued to press Bayern Munich. They didn't stop attacking, as if they didn't want to lose the momentum they had gained from the beginning. Despite the relentless attacks, they were still sharp. But Bayern Munich held on well. - Bayern Munich's defense is good, isn't it? The players are not shaking! It seems like their performance has changed since they conceded two goals at the beginning! - This is Bayern Munich! Now it's really like Bayern Munich! They showed the solid defense that they had displayed in the Bundesliga and effectively defended against Real Madrid's attacks. Moreover, they now attempted sharp counterattacks. Thwack! Bastian Schweinsteiger passed the ball to Philipp Lahm. Philipp Lahm controlled the ball smoothly and then passed it to Thomas Müller, who was in a good position. At that moment, Thomas Müller didn't hold onto the ball. Without being greedy, he passed the ball to Lee Tae-hyun, who was playing as an attacking midfielder today. - Lee Tae-hyun receives the ball! He's playing as an unexpected attacking midfielder today, and he hasn't had a chance to show anything yet, right? But now it seems like his opportunity has come! It would be great if he could show why manager Josep Guardiola put him in as an attacking midfielder! At that moment, Lee Tae-hyun made a play that surprised everyone. - Lee Tae-hyun! He's bold! He makes a daring pass! As soon as he received the ball from Thomas Müller, he attempted a through pass. The pass was sharp as a knife. It was such a quick pass, and the accuracy was almost perfect. The ball quickly arrived at Shin Jae-wook's feet. - Shin Jae-wook has infiltrated the penalty box and has the ball! It's a great opportunity! In a situation where he received the ball stably inside the opponent's penalty box. Moreover, he had enough time to swing his leg for a shot. Swoosh! Shin Jae-wook swung his leg. It was a shot aimed at the difficult upper corner of the goal. - Goal! It's a goal! Finally, a goal for Bayern Munich! - Bayern Munich's pass play was too good! Especially the last killer pass from Lee Tae-hyun was really sharp! - Lee Tae-hyun has talent as an attacking midfielder too? There was a reason why manager Josep Guardiola put Lee Tae-hyun in as an attacking midfielder in such an important game! Lee Tae-hyun, the timing and precision of the pass are amazing! - Shin Jae-wook's first touch and shooting were perfect too! After scoring the goal, Shin Jae-wook raised his thumb to Lee Tae-hyun to express his gratitude for the good pass. \\"Tae-hyun, the pass was good. Thanks to you, I could score comfortably.\\" \\"Hehe! The timing was artistic, right? I thought you would score right away if I passed at that timing. Ha! At this rate, I might end up playing as an attacking midfielder forever? I prefer playing as a winger...\\" \\"Don't get cocky, let's try to make one more goal before the first half ends.\\" \\"Okay! I'll give you a perfectly sweet pass, so look forward to it! Jae-wook, I'll set it up perfectly, so you just need to score well.\\" \\"Scoring goals is my specialty.\\" \\"It's a bit annoying, but it's true. You're the Bundesliga's top scorer, after all.\\" Shin Jae-wook finished his conversation with Lee Tae-hyun and also had a short talk with other teammates. Then, he looked at the fans filling the stands and encouraged their cheers. - The fans' cheers are tremendous! It's fitting for Bayern Munich's home stadium! The home fans are sending a huge cheer to Shin Jae-wook! - I can't predict how this game will go? I wonder which team will advance to the final! After Shin Jae-wook's goal. The team that came out more aggressively was Real Madrid. They conceded one goal but didn't want to lose the good momentum they had at the beginning, so they managed the game that way. And Shin Jae-wook was the quickest to grasp that fact. \\"They're in a hurry right now! They want to score quickly to lead the game, but we just need to lower our line, stay calm, defend, and counterattack! Keep an eye on the speed of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo, and press hard so Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso can't pass comfortably!\\" It was a statement that must have been very annoying to Real Madrid, but to the Bayern Munich players, it felt as reassuring as seeing the answer sheet in an exam. Perhaps that's why? Bayern Munich successfully defended against Real Madrid's dangerous attacks for the remaining time. - The first half ends 2-1! Real Madrid tried to score additional goals, but Bayern Munich didn't give them a chance! - Bayern Munich showed solid gameplay after conceding two goals. On the other hand, Real Madrid might feel regretful about conceding one goal. They allowed a goal when the atmosphere was so good. The second half was intense. Real Madrid actively attacked, and Bayern Munich unfolded the game based on calm defense and strong pressure. - Cristiano Ronaldo tried to infiltrate, but offside was called! Just now, Bayern Munich's offside trap was good, right? - That's right. Today, Cristiano Ronaldo has been caught offside a lot. That means Bayern Munich's defense is using the offside trap well. Indeed, Real Madrid's attack line composed of Benzema, Bale, and Ronaldo was powerful. But Bayern Munich's attack line was also not to be underestimated. Especially when Shin Jae-wook had the ball, Real Madrid's defenders were very tense. They had been greatly defeated in the first leg, and even today, they continued to show threatening movements. It was the same now. - Shin Jae-wook receives the ball! He has been showing great ball-keeping ability throughout today's game, but will he be able to keep the ball this time too? Shin Jae-wook safely received the strong pass from Bastian Schweinsteiger and turned his back on the opposing defender. Pepe, Real Madrid's main player and a world-class defender, pressed hard, but Shin Jae-wook didn't panic and withstood the pressure. - Shin Jae-wook! He doesn't get pushed back in the physical fight with Pepe! Ah~! Shin Jae-wook really doesn't lose the ball! Pepe was desperate. He grabbed clothes, used strength, and stretched out his legs. He focused on defense to the point that it felt a bit dirty. But Shin Jae-wook didn't lose the ball. Cleverly turning his back on Pepe, he used appropriate feints to keep the ball. Moreover, he didn't just keep the ball. While keeping the ball, Shin Jae-wook didn't miss the movements of his teammates. Still being pressured by Pepe. Swoosh! Shin Jae-wook kept moving his body, complicating Pepe's psychology. And now, as if he was going to turn to the left, he spun around. Tap! Swoosh! He turned to the right. At the same time, he kicked the ball hard with his left foot. The ball, kicked while completely turning his body, curved into Real Madrid's penalty box. It was a pass aimed at Thomas Müller, who had broken through Real Madrid's offside trap. - Wow! What a good pass! It was a pass so sharp that it surprised the spectators watching the game. Thomas Müller didn't hesitate for a moment and threw himself at the ball. Diving header. It was a shooting method that could cause injury, but in a situation like this, it was the most efficient method. - Wow! It's in! Thomas Müller! He scores the equalizing goal with a diving header! - Wow... That was good infiltration by Thomas Müller, but Shin Jae-wook's play was really good! He kept the ball against Pepe in the front line and even delivered a surprisingly sharp pass? - Shin Jae-wook seems to be showing what a complete striker is. A striker doesn't necessarily have to score goals, but as Shin Jae-wook just did, keeping the ball in the front line and enduring plays like that can be a great help to the team! This kind of post play is also something that Karim Benzema is very good at, but today, Shin Jae-wook's post play is shining more! The atmosphere at Bayern Munich's home stadium, Allianz Arena, was heated. The Bayern Munich fans filling the place couldn't contain their joy. Bayern Munich, which had been trailing 2-0, had managed to equalize. However, their joy didn't last long. Just 4 minutes after Thomas Müller's goal. A goal by one of the world's best players and Real Madrid's ace, Cristiano Ronaldo, was scored."},{"instruction":"179 * * * 경기가 종료되며 챔피언스리그 결승 진출이 확정된 순간. ― 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들이 기뻐하고 있습니다! 어려운 경기를 펼쳤지만, 결국엔 레알 마드리드라는 최강의 팀을 무너뜨리며 챔피언스리그 결승에 오르게 됐습니다! ― 아~! 정말 명경기였습니다. 양 팀이 모든 걸 쏟아부었고, 전 세계 축구팬들의 눈을 즐겁게 만들어줬죠! 승자는 결정됐지만, 최선을 다해준 레알 마드리드 선수들에게도 박수를 보내고 싶네요! 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 환한 웃음을 지었다. 챔피언스리그 우승을 바라볼 수 있다는 건 이들에게 큰 기쁨을 줬다. “이 기분은 적응이 안 된다니까.” 신재욱의 입꼬리가 꿈틀거렸다. 자꾸만 흘러나오는 웃음을 참을 수가 없었다. 환생 전을 포함하면 챔피언스리그 우승 경력도 많은 편인 그였지만, 지금처럼 결승에 진출할 때는 매번 기뻤다. 경험이 많았음에도 단 한 번도 덤덤할 수가 없었다. “팬들의 환호도 마찬가지고.” 신재욱은 주변을 둘러봤다. 이제는 집처럼 편하게 느껴지는 바이에른 뮌헨의 홈구장 알리안츠 아레나. 그곳에 가득한 홈팬들의 환호는 듣기 좋은 음악처럼 느껴졌다. 심장이 두근거리고 자꾸만 함성을 지르고 싶어졌다. 너무 기쁜 나머지 흥분한 것이다. 이처럼 경험이 많은 신재욱이 이럴 정도니, 다른 선수들의 반응은 더욱 격렬했다. 특히 이택현은 눈이 뒤집히지만 않았을 뿐, 체력적으로 힘든 것도 까먹은 채로 경기장을 뛰어다녔다. 그러더니 이제는 신재욱에게 달려왔다. “재욱아! 결승이야! 챔피언스리그 결승에 올라갔다고! 와! 진짜 기분 너무 좋네!” “우승까지 가야지.” “당연하지! 재욱아 나 오늘 솔직히 공격형 미드필더로 뛰느라 조금 쫄렸는데, 그래도 꽤 잘했지?” “충분히 잘했어.” 자신이 잘했냐고 묻는 이택현의 질문에 신재욱은 고개를 끄덕였다. ‘익숙하지 않은 포지션이라고 하기엔 많이 잘한 게 맞지.’ 공격형 미드필더가 어떤 포지션이던가. 축구 자체를 잘해야만 잘 소화할 수 있는 포지션이다. 특히나 세계 최고 수준의 선수들이 모인 바이에른 뮌헨에서 공격형 미드필더로 뛰려면 엄청난 실력을 갖춰야만 한다. 그런데 만 18세의 이택현이 챔피언스리그 결승전에서 공격형 미드필더로 뛰었다. 부담되는 게 당연했고, 잘할 수 없는 게 당연한 무대였다. 그런데도 잘했다. 정확히 말하면 무난한 경기력이었지만, 그걸로도 놀라운 것이었다. “충분히 잘했다고? 으흐흐흐! 재욱신이 그렇게 말하니까 완전 뿌듯한데?” “재욱신? 그건 또 뭐야? 갑자기 왜 외국인들이 이름 부르듯이 말하냐.” “엥? 이거 몰라? 요즘 한국팬들이 너 부를 때, 재욱신이라고 하잖아. 재욱이라는 이름이랑 말 그대로 신을 뜻하는 ‘신’을 붙여서 재욱신.” “아 최근엔 한국 팬들 반응을 못 봤어. 그럼 재욱GOD이라는 뜻인 거지?” “바로 그거지!” “…이건 좀 민망한데.” “민망하긴 왜 민망해. 리오넬 메시도 메신이라고 불리잖아.” “그건 메시잖아.” “너도 요즘 포스로는 안 꿀리잖아.” “……됐고, 팬분들한테 인사하러 가자.” 신재욱은 화제를 돌렸다. 리오넬 메시와의 비교는 민망했으니까. 환생 전이라면 모를까, 아직은 한참이나 이르다고 생각했다. 꾸준함에서 큰 차이가 나니까. ‘적어도 3시즌은 더 잘해야만 비빌 수 있지 않을까.’ 물론 그럴 수 있다는 자신감은 있었다. * * * 챔피언스리그 결승 진출이 확정된 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨은 분데스리가에서도 연승을 이어갔다. 연승에 가장 큰 역할을 한 선수는 이제는 명실상부 에이스가 된 신재욱이었다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 함부르크에게 7 대 0 대승!」 「홈구장에서 굴욕적인 패배한 함부르크, 신재욱을 막지 못한 대가는 컸다.」 「신재욱, 함부르크전에서 4개의 공격포인트 기록! 3개의 골과 1개의 도움으로 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커다운 경기 펼쳐!」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 슈투트가르트에게 4 대 0 승리!」 「신재욱, 1골 2도움 기록하며 뛰어난 활약 펼쳐!」 「완벽한 경기력으로 슈투트가르트의 수비진을 무너뜨린 신재욱, 또다시 분데스리가의 득점왕 됐다!」 연승을 거둔 바이에른 뮌헨에겐 자연스레 분데스리가 우승도 따라왔다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 2013/14시즌 분데스리가 우승!」 「우승컵 ‘마이스터샬레’를 들어 올리는 신재욱! 전 세계를 놀라게 한 한국인 소년, 이제는 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스가 됐다!」 「천재 신재욱, 두 시즌 연속 분데스리가 득점왕에 올라!」 「분데스리가 무패 우승 이뤄낸 바이에른 뮌헨! 챔피언스리그 우승까지 해내나?」 분데스리가 우승을 거두고, 득점왕을 해낸 지금. 독일 현지에서 신재욱을 향한 관심은 대단했다. 축구와 관련된 이야기가 나올 때면 ‘신재욱’이라는 이름이 빠지지 않을 정도였다. 독일 현지뿐만 아니라 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심도 대단했다. 이들은 신재욱이 어린 나이에 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스가 되었다는 사실에도 놀랐지만, 신재욱이 이번 시즌에 기록한 공격포인트의 숫자에 더욱 놀라움을 드러냈다. └ 34경기 49골 27어시스트????? 신재욱 얘 사람 맞냐? └ 더 놀라운 게 뭔지 알아? 얘 겨우 18살이라는 거야. └ 지난 시즌엔 20경기 36골 19어시스트였고, 이번 시즌엔 34경기 49골 27어시스트를 했어. 근데 얘보고 거품이라고 했던 멍청이들은 어디로 도망갔을까? └ 신재욱은 의심할 수 없는 월드클래스야. 얘보고 월드클래스 아니라고 하는 바보들은 그냥 신재욱이 너무 빨리 월드클래스가 돼서 인정하기 싫은 것뿐이야. 그게 아니면 인종차별주의자들이던가. └ 만 18세에 분데스리가 득점왕 2회에 분데스리가 우승 2회라는 커리어라니…… 게다가 챔피언스리그 우승까지 앞두고 있잖아? 이 정도면 이번 2014년에 가장 핫한 선수라고 말해도 되겠어. └ 챔피언스리그 우승은 아직 모르는 일이지. 근데 굳이 챔피언스리그 우승 커리어가 아니더라도 신재욱은 세계 최고의 공격수 중 하나가 맞아. 분데스리가 두 시즌 연속 득점왕이잖아. 그것만으로도 증명이 된 거지. └ 34경기에 나와서 49골 27어시스트라니…… 모르는 사람이 보면 분데스리가가 쉬운 리그인 줄 알겠어. └ 분데스리가가 강력한 리그라는 건 이번 챔피언스리그를 보면 알잖아? 레알 마드리드도 바이에른 뮌헨에게 무너진 거 못 본 사람 없지? └ 신재욱이 신계의 문을 강하게 두드리고 있구만! 분데스리가 34경기 49골 27어시스트. 신재욱이 이번 2013/14시즌에 만들어낸 기록이었다. 압도적인 골 숫자로 득점왕에 올랐고, 어시스트의 숫자 또한 분데스리가 최고였다. 신재욱이 팬들과 전문가들 사이에서 이번 시즌 분데스리가 최고의 선수로 뽑힌 것도 이상한 일이 아니었다. 「신재욱, 팬들의 투표에서 2013/14시즌 분데스리가 최고의 선수로 뽑혀!」 이러한 사실에 한국 축구팬들 역시 가만히 있지 못했다. 같은 한국인이 유럽에서 엄청난 활약을 한다는 사실에 커다란 관심을 드러냈다. └ 신재욱 왜 이렇게 잘하냐? 한국인이 분데스리가에서 두 시즌 연속 득점왕을 할 수가 있는 거였어?ㄷㄷㄷ └ 난 신재욱이 분데스리가에서 잘하는 건 알고 있었지만, 챔피언스리그에서까지도 이렇게 잘할 줄은 몰랐어. 맨체스터 유나이티드랑 레알 마드리드를 상대로도 그냥 개쩔던데? └ 신재욱은 신기할 정도로 노련해. 그냥 천재라는 말로는 부족한 게, 얜 경험이 많아야만 할 수 있는 플레이를 한다니까? └ 나 유럽에서 여행 중인데, 신재욱 인기 장난 아니더라. 그냥 신재욱 이름만 꺼내면 바로 인싸되는 거야. └ 영국에서도 신재욱은 엄청 유명해졌어. 내가 듣기론 영국의 빅클럽들이 가장 영입하길 원하는 공격수라던데? └ 그럴 만도 하지. 거의 완벽한 공격수잖아. 신재욱은 발이 빠르지 않다는 걸 제외하면 단점이 없어. └ 발이 빠르지 않은 단점도 타이밍으로 커버하잖아. 걍 완벽한 공격수임. └ 아마 몇 년 뒤엔 리오넬 메시나 크리스티아누 호날두보다 높은 평가를 받을 수도? └ 그러려면 발롱도르는 타야지. └ 머지않아 발롱도르도 탈 듯. 그리고 만약 신재욱이 챔피언스리그에서 우승한다면 이번 시즌에 발롱도르 받을 수도 있어. 리오넬 메시나 크리스티아누 호날두가 엄청 잘하긴 하지만, 이번 시즌만큼은 신재욱의 커리어가 더 좋은 것 같거든. └ 딱 이번 시즌만 놓고 보면 신재욱도 최고는 맞아. 분데스리가 우승이라는 타이틀을 거머쥔 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 일주일간 컨디션 회복에 집중했다. 훈련을 최소한으로 줄이며 휴식에 신경을 썼다. 챔피언스리그 결승전까지 남은 시간이 많은 편이었기에 가능한 일이었다. “얼마 만에 이렇게 쉬는 건지.” 침대에 누운 신재욱이 두꺼운 서류로 시선을 옮겼다. 그는 다른 선수들이 휴식을 취할 때도 지금처럼 상대를 분석했다. 웬만해선 아무것도 안 하고 누워있는 경우가 없었다. 상대 선수들의 정보를 외우고, 상대 선수들과 관련된 영상을 하나라도 더 찾아봤다. 신재욱에게는 그것만으로도 충분히 쉬는 것이었다. 그리고 그런 모습을 이해할 수 없다는 표정으로 바라보는 사람도 있었다. “재욱아.” “왜?” “안 지겨워? 쉴 땐 그냥 푹 쉬고 싶지 않아?” “지겹긴 무슨. 그리고 지금 쉬고 있잖아.” 이택현은 혀를 내둘렀다. “너의 이런 모습은 봐도 봐도 적응이 안 돼. 어떻게 사람이 이렇게까지 축구만 생각할 수가 있지? 재욱아, 네 머릿속엔 축구밖에 없냐?” “축구만 생각하려고 노력하는 거지.” “그게 노력으로 되는 거였어……? 재욱아, 쉴 땐 좀 푹 쉬기도 해. 저번에 과르디올라 감독님도 네가 너무 축구에만 몰두하는 것 같다고 쉴 땐 쉬라고 하셨잖아.” “난 이게 쉬는 거야.” “어이구 그러시겠죠. 나중에 피곤하다고 해도 난 모른다.” 고개를 절레절레 흔드는 이택현을 보며 미소를 지은 뒤, 신재욱은 다시 손에 쥔 서류를 바라봤다. ‘아틀레티코 마드리드라…….’ 서류엔 라리가의 강팀 아틀레티코 마드리드와 관련된 정보가 빼곡하게 적혀있었다. 구단에 요청해서 받은 정보들과 직접 찾은 정보들을 모아놓은 자료였다. ‘강한 팀이지.’ 챔피언스리그 결승전에서 만나게 될 팀이었다. 당연히 강팀이었다. 강팀이 아니라면 챔피언스리그 결승이라는 위치에 오를 수 없으니까. 그래서 신재욱은 아틀레티코 마드리드를 분석하는 것에 더욱 집중했다. 시간은 계속 흘렀다. 상대의 약점을 하나라도 더 찾아낼 수 있다면 더 많은 시간도 투자할 생각이었다. 몇 시간이나 흘렀을까? 한참을 서류에 집중하던 신재욱이 드디어 침대에서 몸을 일으켰다. 며칠간 매달린 끝에 아틀레티코 마드리드에 관련된 정보를 머릿속에 전부 넣는 것에 성공했다. 그리고 두 가지 확신을 하게 됐다. “재밌는 경기를 만들기는 어렵겠어.” 첫 번째로는 아틀레티코 마드리드와의 경기는 재미가 없을 거라는 확신이었다. “문을 걸어 잠그는 팀을 상대론 할 수 있는 게 많지 않으니까.” 그리고 두 번째로는. “그래도 오랜만에 챔피언스리그 우승 맛 좀 보겠네.” 아틀레티코 마드리드에게 승리할 수 있다는 확신이었다.","output":"179 --- At the moment when the match ended and the Champions League final advancement was confirmed. - The Bayern Munich players are celebrating! They had a tough game, but in the end, they have defeated Real Madrid, the strongest team, and advanced to the Champions League final! - Ah~! It was truly a great match. Both teams gave their all and delighted the eyes of soccer fans around the world! The winner has been decided, but I also want to applaud the Real Madrid players who gave their best! The Bayern Munich players beamed with bright smiles. The prospect of winning the Champions League brought them great joy. \\"I just can't get used to this feeling.\\" Shin Jae-wook's lips twitched. He couldn't help but let out a smile. Even though he had won the Champions League several times before, including in his previous life, he was always happy when advancing to the final. Despite his experience, he could never be indifferent about it. \\"The cheers of the fans are the same.\\" Shin Jae-wook looked around. Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich's home stadium, now felt as comfortable as home. The cheers of the home fans filled the place like pleasant music. His heart raced, and he wanted to shout out loud. He was so excited with joy. If an experienced player like Shin Jae-wook felt this way, the reactions of the other players were even more intense. Especially Lee Tae-hyun, who, except for not flipping his eyes, ran around the field forgetting his physical exhaustion. Then he ran over to Shin Jae-wook. \\"Jae-wook! It's the final! We've made it to the Champions League final! Wow! I feel so good!\\" \\"We have to win the title.\\" \\"Of course! Jae-wook, honestly, I was a bit nervous playing as an attacking midfielder today, but I did quite well, didn't I?\\" \\"You did well enough.\\" Shin Jae-wook nodded in response to Lee Tae-hyun's question about his performance. 'It's true that he did well, even for an unfamiliar position.' What is an attacking midfielder? It's a position that can only be played well by someone who is good at soccer itself. Especially in a team like Bayern Munich, where the world's top players are gathered, one must have tremendous skill to play as an attacking midfielder. Yet, 18-year-old Lee Tae-hyun played as an attacking midfielder in the Champions League final. It was natural to feel burdened, and it was a stage where it was natural not to perform well. But he did well. To be precise, it was a satisfactory performance, but that in itself was amazing. \\"You did well enough? Ehehehe! I feel so proud when Jae-wook GOD says that!\\" \\"Jae-wook GOD? What's that? Why are you suddenly talking like foreigners calling names?\\" \\"Huh? You don't know? These days, Korean fans call you 'Jae-wook GOD.' It's a combination of your name Jae-wook and the word 'GOD.'\\" \\"Ah, I haven't seen the reactions of Korean fans recently. So it means Jae-wook GOD?\\" \\"Exactly!\\" \\"...That's a bit embarrassing.\\" \\"Embarrassing? Why? Lionel Messi is also called 'Messi GOD.'\\" \\"That's Messi.\\" \\"You're not falling behind in terms of presence these days.\\" \\"...Let's go and greet the fans.\\" Shin Jae-wook changed the subject. Comparing himself to Lionel Messi was embarrassing. In his previous life, maybe, but he still thought it was too early. There was a big difference in consistency. 'At least three more seasons of good performance would be needed to compare.' Of course, he had the confidence that he could do it. --- After the Champions League final advancement was confirmed. Bayern Munich continued their winning streak in the Bundesliga. The player who played the biggest role in the winning streak was Shin Jae-wook, who had now become the undisputed ace. \\"Bayern Munich, a 7-0 victory over Hamburg!\\" \\"Hamburg suffers a humiliating defeat at home, unable to stop Shin Jae-wook.\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook records 4 points against Hamburg! With 3 goals and 1 assist, he shows a performance worthy of the Bundesliga's best striker!\\" \\"Bayern Munich, a 4-0 victory over Stuttgart!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook, with 1 goal and 2 assists, shows an outstanding performance!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook, who broke down Stuttgart's defense with perfect gameplay, becomes the Bundesliga's top scorer again!\\" Naturally, the Bundesliga title followed Bayern Munich's winning streak. \\"Bayern Munich, 2013/14 Bundesliga champions!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook lifting the 'Meisterschale' trophy! The Korean boy who shocked the world, now the ace of Bayern Munich!\\" \\"Genius Shin Jae-wook, two seasons in a row as the Bundesliga's top scorer!\\" \\"Bayern Munich achieves an undefeated Bundesliga championship! Will they also win the Champions League?\\" Now, having won the Bundesliga and secured the top scorer title. The interest in Shin Jae-wook in Germany was tremendous. Whenever there was talk about soccer, the name 'Shin Jae-wook' was mentioned. Not only in Germany but also among soccer fans worldwide, there was great interest. They were surprised that Shin Jae-wook had become the ace of Bayern Munich at such a young age, but they were even more astonished by the number of points he had scored this season. \\"34 games, 49 goals, 27 assists????? Is Shin Jae-wook even human?\\" \\"You know what's even more surprising? He's only 18 years old.\\" \\"Last season he had 36 goals and 19 assists in 20 games, and this season he's got 49 goals and 27 assists in 34 games. Where did all those idiots who called him overrated run off to?\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook is undeniably world-class. The only people who say he's not are those who just can't accept that he became world-class so quickly. If not, they're just racists.\\" \\"At 18 years old, to have a career of two Bundesliga top scorer titles and two Bundesliga championships... And he's on the verge of winning the Champions League too? At this rate, he could be called the hottest player of 2014.\\" \\"The Champions League victory is still uncertain. But even without a Champions League victory career, Shin Jae-wook is one of the world's best strikers. He's been the Bundesliga's top scorer for two consecutive seasons. That's proof enough.\\" \\"34 games, 49 goals, 27 assists... If someone didn't know better, they'd think the Bundesliga is an easy league.\\" \\"You know the Bundesliga is a strong league if you've seen this Champions League, right? Didn't everyone see Real Madrid crumble against Bayern Munich?\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook is knocking hard on the gates of the divine realm!\\" Bundesliga 34 games, 49 goals, 27 assists. That was the record Shin Jae-wook created in the 2013/14 season. He became the top scorer with an overwhelming number of goals, and his number of assists was also the highest in the Bundesliga. It was no surprise that Shin Jae-wook was chosen as the best player of the Bundesliga season by fans and experts alike. \\"Shin Jae-wook, voted by fans as the best player of the 2013/14 Bundesliga season!\\" Korean soccer fans also couldn't stay calm about this fact. They showed great interest in the fact that a Korean was performing so incredibly in Europe. \\"Why is Shin Jae-wook so good? Could a Korean really be the Bundesliga's top scorer for two consecutive seasons?ㄷㄷㄷ\\" \\"I knew Shin Jae-wook was doing well in the Bundesliga, but I didn't know he would do so well in the Champions League too. He was just amazing against Manchester United and Real Madrid?\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook is surprisingly mature. It's not enough to call him a genius because he makes plays that require a lot of experience, you know?\\" \\"I'm traveling in Europe right now, and Shin Jae-wook's popularity is no joke. Just mention his name, and you become an instant insider.\\" \\"In the UK, Shin Jae-wook has become very famous. From what I've heard, he's the striker that the big clubs in England want to sign the most?\\" \\"That makes sense. He's almost a perfect striker. Shin Jae-wook has no weaknesses except for not being fast.\\" \\"Even the weakness of not being fast is covered by his timing. He's just a perfect striker.\\" \\"Maybe in a few years, he'll be rated higher than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo?\\" \\"For that, he needs to win the Ballon d'Or.\\" \\"It won't be long before he wins the Ballon d'Or. And if Shin Jae-wook wins the Champions League this season, he might even win the Ballon d'Or this year. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are doing great, but this season, Shin Jae-wook's career seems better.\\" \\"Just looking at this season alone, Shin Jae-wook is indeed one of the best.\\" After securing the Bundesliga title. The Bayern Munich players focused on recovering their condition for a week. They reduced training to a minimum and focused on rest. There was plenty of time left until the Champions League final, so it was possible. \\"How long has it been since I've rested like this?\\" Lying on the bed, Shin Jae-wook shifted his gaze to a thick stack of documents. Even when other players were resting, he analyzed the opponent like now. He rarely lay down doing nothing. He memorized information about the opposing players and searched for more videos related to them. For Shin Jae-wook, that was enough rest. And there was someone who looked at him with an expression that couldn't understand such behavior. \\"Jae-wook.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Aren't you bored? Don't you want to rest properly when it's time to rest?\\" \\"What do you mean bored? And I am resting right now.\\" Lee Tae-hyun clicked his tongue. \\"I can never get used to seeing you like this. How can someone think about soccer this much? Jae-wook, is there nothing but soccer in your head?\\" \\"I try to think only about soccer.\\" \\"That's something you can do with effort...? Jae-wook, take a proper rest when it's time to rest. Even Coach Guardiola said you seem too immersed in soccer and told you to rest when it's time to rest.\\" \\"I am resting.\\" \\"Sure, sure. If you get tired later, don't say I didn't warn you.\\" Shin Jae-wook smiled at Lee Tae-hyun, who was shaking his head, and then looked back at the documents in his hand. 'Atletico Madrid...' The documents were filled with information related to Atletico Madrid, a strong team from La Liga. It was a compilation of information requested from the club and information he had found himself. 'They're a strong team.' It was the team they would face in the Champions League final. Of course, they were a strong team. If they weren't strong, they wouldn't be able to reach the position of the Champions League final. That's why Shin Jae-wook focused even more on analyzing Atletico Madrid. Time continued to pass. He was willing to invest even more time if he could find even one more weakness in the opponent. How many hours had passed? After focusing on the documents for a while, Shin Jae-wook finally got up from the bed. After several days of dedication, he had successfully memorized all the information related to Atletico Madrid.

으흐흐흐! 재욱신이 그렇게 말하니까 완전 뿌듯한데?” “재욱신? 그건 또 뭐야? 갑자기 왜 외국인들이 이름 부르듯이 말하냐.” “엥? 이거 몰라? 요즘 한국팬들이 너 부를 때, 재욱신이라고 하잖아. 재욱이라는 이름이랑 말 그대로 신을 뜻하는 ‘신’을 붙여서 재욱신.” “아 최근엔 한국 팬들 반응을 못 봤어. 그럼 재욱GOD이라는 뜻인 거지?” “바로 그거지!” “…이건 좀 민망한데.” “민망하긴 왜 민망해. 리오넬 메시도 메신이라고 불리잖아.” “그건 메시잖아.” “너도 요즘 포스로는 안 꿀리잖아.” “……됐고, 팬분들한테 인사하러 가자.” 신재욱은 화제를 돌렸다. 리오넬 메시와의 비교는 민망했으니까. 환생 전이라면 모를까, 아직은 한참이나 이르다고 생각했다. 꾸준함에서 큰 차이가 나니까. ‘적어도 3시즌은 더 잘해야만 비빌 수 있지 않을까.’ 물론 그럴 수 있다는 자신감은 있었다. * * * 챔피언스리그 결승 진출이 확정된 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨은 분데스리가에서도 연승을 이어갔다. 연승에 가장 큰 역할을 한 선수는 이제는 명실상부 에이스가 된 신재욱이었다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 함부르크에게 7 대 0 대승!」 「홈구장에서 굴욕적인 패배한 함부르크, 신재욱을 막지 못한 대가는 컸다.」 「신재욱, 함부르크전에서 4개의 공격포인트 기록! 3개의 골과 1개의 도움으로 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커다운 경기 펼쳐!」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 슈투트가르트에게 4 대 0 승리!」 「신재욱, 1골 2도움 기록하며 뛰어난 활약 펼쳐!」 「완벽한 경기력으로 슈투트가르트의 수비진을 무너뜨린 신재욱, 또다시 분데스리가의 득점왕 됐다!」 연승을 거둔 바이에른 뮌헨에겐 자연스레 분데스리가 우승도 따라왔다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 2013/14시즌 분데스리가 우승!」 「우승컵 ‘마이스터샬레’를 들어 올리는 신재욱! 전 세계를 놀라게 한 한국인 소년, 이제는 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스가 됐다!」 「천재 신재욱, 두 시즌 연속 분데스리가 득점왕에 올라!」 「분데스리가 무패 우승 이뤄낸 바이에른 뮌헨! 챔피언스리그 우승까지 해내나?」 분데스리가 우승을 거두고, 득점왕을 해낸 지금. 독일 현지에서 신재욱을 향한 관심은 대단했다. 축구와 관련된 이야기가 나올 때면 ‘신재욱’이라는 이름이 빠지지 않을 정도였다. 독일 현지뿐만 아니라 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심도 대단했다. 이들은 신재욱이 어린 나이에 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스가 되었다는 사실에도 놀랐지만, 신재욱이 이번 시즌에 기록한 공격포인트의 숫자에 더욱 놀라움을 드러냈다. └ 34경기 49골 27어시스트????? 신재욱 얘 사람 맞냐? └ 더 놀라운 게 뭔지 알아? 얘 겨우 18살이라는 거야. └ 지난 시즌엔 20경기 36골 19어시스트였고, 이번 시즌엔 34경기 49골 27어시스트를 했어. 근데 얘보고 거품이라고 했던 멍청이들은 어디로 도망갔을까? └ 신재욱은 의심할 수 없는 월드클래스야. 얘보고 월드클래스 아니라고 하는 바보들은 그냥 신재욱이 너무 빨리 월드클래스가 돼서 인정하기 싫은 것뿐이야. 그게 아니면 인종차별주의자들이던가. └ 만 18세에 분데스리가 득점왕 2회에 분데스리가 우승 2회라는 커리어라니…… 게다가 챔피언스리그 우승까지 앞두고 있잖아? 이 정도면 이번 2014년에 가장 핫한 선수라고 말해도 되겠어. └ 챔피언스리그 우승은 아직 모르는 일이지. 근데 굳이 챔피언스리그 우승 커리어가 아니더라도 신재욱은 세계 최고의 공격수 중 하나가 맞아. 분데스리가 두 시즌 연속 득점왕이잖아. 그것만으로도 증명이 된 거지. └ 34경기에 나와서 49골 27어시스트라니…… 모르는 사람이 보면 분데스리가가 쉬운 리그인 줄 알겠어. └ 분데스리가가 강력한 리그라는 건 이번 챔피언스리그를 보면 알잖아? 레알 마드리드도 바이에른 뮌헨에게 무너진 거 못 본 사람 없지? └ 신재욱이 신계의 문을 강하게 두드리고 있구만! 분데스리가 34경기 49골 27어시스트. 신재욱이 이번 2013/14시즌에 만들어낸 기록이었다. 압도적인 골 숫자로 득점왕에 올랐고, 어시스트의 숫자 또한 분데스리가 최고였다. 신재욱이 팬들과 전문가들 사이에서 이번 시즌 분데스리가 최고의 선수로 뽑힌 것도 이상한 일이 아니었다. 「신재욱, 팬들의 투표에서 2013/14시즌 분데스리가 최고의 선수로 뽑혀!」 이러한 사실에 한국 축구팬들 역시 가만히 있지 못했다. 같은 한국인이 유럽에서 엄청난 활약을 한다는 사실에 커다란 관심을 드러냈다. └ 신재욱 왜 이렇게 잘하냐? 한국인이 분데스리가에서 두 시즌 연속 득점왕을 할 수가 있는 거였어?ㄷㄷㄷ └ 난 신재욱이 분데스리가에서 잘하는 건 알고 있었지만, 챔피언스리그에서까지도 이렇게 잘할 줄은 몰랐어. 맨체스터 유나이티드랑 레알 마드리드를 상대로도 그냥 개쩔던데? └ 신재욱은 신기할 정도로 노련해. 그냥 천재라는 말로는 부족한 게, 얜 경험이 많아야만 할 수 있는 플레이를 한다니까? └ 나 유럽에서 여행 중인데, 신재욱 인기 장난 아니더라. 그냥 신재욱 이름만 꺼내면 바로 인싸되는 거야. └ 영국에서도 신재욱은 엄청 유명해졌어. 내가 듣기론 영국의 빅클럽들이 가장 영입하길 원하는 공격수라던데? └ 그럴 만도 하지. 거의 완벽한 공격수잖아. 신재욱은 발이 빠르지 않다는 걸 제외하면 단점이 없어. └ 발이 빠르지 않은 단점도 타이밍으로 커버하잖아. 걍 완벽한 공격수임. └ 아마 몇 년 뒤엔 리오넬 메시나 크리스티아누 호날두보다 높은 평가를 받을 수도? └ 그러려면 발롱도르는 타야지. └ 머지않아 발롱도르도 탈 듯. 그리고 만약 신재욱이 챔피언스리그에서 우승한다면 이번 시즌에 발롱도르 받을 수도 있어. 리오넬 메시나 크리스티아누 호날두가 엄청 잘하긴 하지만, 이번 시즌만큼은 신재욱의 커리어가 더 좋은 것 같거든. └ 딱 이번 시즌만 놓고 보면 신재욱도 최고는 맞아. 분데스리가 우승이라는 타이틀을 거머쥔 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 일주일간 컨디션 회복에 집중했다. 훈련을 최소한으로 줄이며 휴식에 신경을 썼다. 챔피언스리그 결승전까지 남은 시간이 많은 편이었기에 가능한 일이었다. “얼마 만에 이렇게 쉬는 건지.” 침대에 누운 신재욱이 두꺼운 서류로 시선을 옮겼다. 그는 다른 선수들이 휴식을 취할 때도 지금처럼 상대를 분석했다. 웬만해선 아무것도 안 하고 누워있는 경우가 없었다. 상대 선수들의 정보를 외우고, 상대 선수들과 관련된 영상을 하나라도 더 찾아봤다. 신재욱에게는 그것만으로도 충분히 쉬는 것이었다. 그리고 그런 모습을 이해할 수 없다는 표정으로 바라보는 사람도 있었다. “재욱아.” “왜?” “안 지겨워? 쉴 땐 그냥 푹 쉬고 싶지 않아?” “지겹긴 무슨. 그리고 지금 쉬고 있잖아.” 이택현은 혀를 내둘렀다. “너의 이런 모습은 봐도 봐도 적응이 안 돼. 어떻게 사람이 이렇게까지 축구만 생각할 수가 있지? 재욱아, 네 머릿속엔 축구밖에 없냐?” “축구만 생각하려고 노력하는 거지.” “그게 노력으로 되는 거였어……? 재욱아, 쉴 땐 좀 푹 쉬기도 해. 저번에 과르디올라 감독님도 네가 너무 축구에만 몰두하는 것 같다고 쉴 땐 쉬라고 하셨잖아.” “난 이게 쉬는 거야.” “어이구 그러시겠죠. 나중에 피곤하다고 해도 난 모른다.” 고개를 절레절레 흔드는 이택현을 보며 미소를 지은 뒤, 신재욱은 다시 손에 쥔 서류를 바라봤다. ‘아틀레티코 마드리드라…….’ 서류엔 라리가의 강팀 아틀레티코 마드리드와 관련된 정보가 빼곡하게 적혀있었다. 구단에 요청해서 받은 정보들과 직접 찾은 정보들을 모아놓은 자료였다. ‘강한 팀이지.’ 챔피언스리그 결승전에서 만나게 될 팀이었다. 당연히 강팀이었다. 강팀이 아니라면 챔피언스리그 결승이라는 위치에 오를 수 없으니까. 그래서 신재욱은 아틀레티코 마드리드를 분석하는 것에 더욱 집중했다. 시간은 계속 흘렀다. 상대의 약점을 하나라도 더 찾아낼 수 있다면 더 많은 시간도 투자할 생각이었다. 몇 시간이나 흘렀을까? 한참을 서류에 집중하던 신재욱이 드디어 침대에서 몸을 일으켰다. 며칠간 매달린 끝에 아틀레티코 마드리드에 관련된 정보를 머릿속에 전부 넣는 것에 성공했다. 그리고 두 가지 확신을 하게 됐다. “재밌는 경기를 만들기는 어렵겠어.” 첫 번째로는 아틀레티코 마드리드와의 경기는 재미가 없을 거라는 확신이었다. “문을 걸어 잠그는 팀을 상대론 할 수 있는 게 많지 않으니까.” 그리고 두 번째로는. “그래도 오랜만에 챔피언스리그 우승 맛 좀 보겠네.” 아틀레티코 마드리드에게 승리할 수 있다는 확신이었다.","output":"179 --- The moment the match ended and the Champions League final spot was confirmed. - The Bayern Munich players are celebrating! It was a tough match, but in the end, they managed to defeat the strongest team, Real Madrid, and advance to the Champions League final! - Ah~! It was truly a great match. Both teams gave it their all, and they entertained soccer fans all over the world! The winner has been decided, but I also want to applaud the Real Madrid players who did their best! The Bayern Munich players were all smiles. The prospect of winning the Champions League brought them great joy. \\"I'm still not used to this feeling.\\" Shin Jaewook's lips twitched. He couldn't help but laugh. Even though he had won the Champions League several times before, including before his reincarnation, he was always happy to advance to the final. Despite his experience, he could never be indifferent about it. \\"The cheers of the fans are the same.\\" Shin Jaewook looked around. The Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich's home stadium, which now felt as comfortable as home. The cheers of the home fans filled the place and felt like pleasant music to his ears. His heart was racing, and he wanted to shout out loud. He was so excited. Considering how experienced Shin Jaewook was, the reactions of the other players were even more intense. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who, if his eyes hadn't rolled back in his head, would have forgotten how physically demanding it was and ran around the field. Then he ran over to Shin Jaewook. \\"Jaewook! It's the final! We've made it to the Champions League final! Wow! I'm really feeling great!\\" \\"We have to win the title.\\" \\"Of course! Jaewook, honestly, I was a bit nervous playing as an attacking midfielder today, but I did pretty well, right?\\" \\"You did well enough.\\" Shin Jaewook nodded in response to Lee Taekhyun's question about his performance. 'It's true that he did well, even for an unfamiliar position.' What position is an attacking midfielder? It's a position that can only be played well by someone who is good at soccer itself. Especially at Bayern Munich, where the world's top players are gathered, you have to be incredibly skilled to play as an attacking midfielder. Yet 18-year-old Lee Taekhyun played as an attacking midfielder in the Champions League final. It was natural to feel burdened, and it was a stage where it was natural not to perform well. But he did well. To be precise, his performance was adequate, but that in itself was remarkable. \\"You did well enough? Ehehehe! When Jaewook-GOD says so, it feels really great!\\" \\"Jaewook-GOD? What's that? Why are you suddenly talking like foreigners calling names?\\" \\"Eh? Don't you know? These days, Korean fans call you Jaewook-GOD. It's a combination of your name Jaewook and the word 'GOD'.\\" \\"Ah, I haven't seen the reactions of Korean fans recently. So it means Jaewook-GOD, right?\\" \\"Exactly!\\" \\"...This is a bit embarrassing.\\" \\"Why be embarrassed? Lionel Messi is also called Messi-GOD.\\" \\"That's Messi.\\" \\"You're not falling behind in terms of presence these days.\\" \\"…Let's go and greet the fans.\\" Shin Jaewook changed the subject. The comparison with Lionel Messi was embarrassing. Before his reincarnation, maybe, but he still thought it was too early. There was a big difference in consistency. 'At least three more seasons to be on par, right?' Of course, he was confident that he could do it. --- After confirming their spot in the Champions League final, Bayern Munich continued their winning streak in the Bundesliga. The player who played the biggest role in the winning streak was Shin Jaewook, who had now become the undisputed ace. \\"Bayern Munich, a 7-0 victory over Hamburg!\\" \\"Hamburg suffers a humiliating defeat at home, unable to stop Shin Jaewook.\\" \\"Shin Jaewook records 4 attack points in the match against Hamburg! With 3 goals and 1 assist, he shows why he's the best striker in the Bundesliga!\\" \\"Bayern Munich, a 4-0 victory over Stuttgart!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, with 1 goal and 2 assists, shows an outstanding performance!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook, who destroyed Stuttgart's defense with a perfect performance, becomes the Bundesliga's top scorer again!\\" Naturally, the Bundesliga title followed Bayern Munich's winning streak. \\"Bayern Munich, 2013/14 Bundesliga champions!\\" \\"Shin Jaewook lifting the 'Meisterschale' trophy! The Korean boy who shocked the world is now the ace of Bayern Munich!\\" \\"Genius Shin Jaewook, two seasons in a row as the Bundesliga's top scorer!\\" \\"Bayern Munich achieves an undefeated Bundesliga championship! Will they also win the Champions League?\\" Now that he had won the Bundesliga and become the top scorer, the interest in Shin Jaewook in Germany was tremendous. Whenever there was talk of soccer, the name 'Shin Jaewook' was mentioned. Not only in Germany but also among soccer fans around the world, there was great interest. They were surprised not only by the fact that Shin Jaewook had become the ace of Bayern Munich at a young age but also by the number of attack points he had recorded this season. └ 34 matches, 49 goals, 27 assists????? Is Shin Jaewook even human? └ You know what's even more surprising? He's only 18 years old. └ Last season he had 36 goals and 19 assists in 20 matches, and this season he's got 49 goals and 27 assists in 34 matches. Where did all those idiots who called him overrated run off to? └ Shin Jaewook is undeniably world-class. Anyone who says he's not just doesn't want to admit that he became world-class too quickly. Or they're racists. └ At 18 years old, two Bundesliga top scorer titles and two Bundesliga championships... And he's on the verge of winning the Champions League? This makes him the hottest player of 2014. └ We don't know about the Champions League yet. But even without a Champions League title, Shin Jaewook is one of the world's best strikers. He's been the Bundesliga's top scorer for two consecutive seasons. That's proof enough. └ 49 goals and 27 assists in 34 matches... If someone didn't know better, they'd think the Bundesliga was an easy league. └ You can tell the Bundesliga is a strong league just by looking at this year's Champions League, right? Didn't Real Madrid also fall to Bayern Munich? └ Shin Jaewook is knocking hard on the doors of the divine realm! Bundesliga 34 matches, 49 goals, 27 assists. That was the record Shin Jaewook created in the 2013/14 season. With an overwhelming number of goals, he became the top scorer, and his number of assists was also the highest in the Bundesliga. It was no surprise that Shin Jaewook was chosen as the best player of the season in the Bundesliga by fans and experts alike. \\"Shin Jaewook, voted by fans as the best player of the 2013/14 Bundesliga season!\\" Korean soccer fans couldn't stay calm about this fact either. They showed great interest in the fact that a fellow Korean was performing so well in Europe. └ Why is Shin Jaewook so good? Could a Korean really be the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons?ㄷㄷㄷ └ I knew Shin Jaewook was doing well in the Bundesliga, but I didn't expect him to do this well in the Champions League. Against Manchester United and Real Madrid, he was just amazing, right? └ Shin Jaewook is surprisingly mature. It's not just genius; he plays like someone with a lot of experience. └ I'm traveling in Europe, and Shin Jaewook's popularity is no joke. Just mention his name, and you're instantly popular. └ In the UK, Shin Jaewook has become very famous. From what I've heard, he's the striker that the big clubs in England want to sign the most. └ That makes sense. He's almost a perfect striker. Shin Jaewook is fast, and aside from not being fast, he has no weaknesses. └ Even the weakness of not being fast is covered by his timing. He's just a perfect striker. └ Maybe in a few years, he'll be rated higher than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? └ For that, he needs to win the Ballon d'Or. └ It won't be long before he wins the Ballon d'Or. And if Shin Jaewook wins the Champions League this season, he might even win the Ballon d'Or this year. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are doing great, but this season, Shin Jaewook's career seems better. └ If we're just talking about this season, Shin Jaewook is definitely one of the best. After securing the Bundesliga title, the Bayern Munich players focused on recovering their condition for a week. They reduced training to a minimum and focused on rest. There was plenty of time left until the Champions League final, so it was possible. \\"How long has it been since I've rested like this?\\" Shin Jaewook, lying on the bed, shifted his gaze to a thick stack of papers. Even when other players were resting, he analyzed the opponent like he was doing now. He rarely lay down doing nothing. He memorized information about the opposing players and searched for more videos related to them. For Shin Jaewook, that was enough rest. And there was someone who looked at him with an expression that couldn't understand such behavior. \\"Jaewook.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Aren't you tired of it? Don't you just want to rest when it's time to rest?\\" \\"What do you mean tired? And I am resting right now.\\" Lee Taekhyun clicked his tongue. \\"I can't get used to seeing you like this. How can a person think about soccer this much? Jaewook, is there nothing but soccer in your head?\\" \\"I try to think only about soccer.\\" \\"Is that something you can do with effort...? Jaewook, take a real rest when it's time to rest. Even Coach Guardiola said you seem too focused on soccer and told you to rest when it's time to rest.\\" \\"I am resting.\\" \\"Sure, sure. I won't know if you get tired later.\\" Lee Taekhyun shook his head and smiled, then Shin Jaewook looked back at the papers in his hand. 'Atletico Madrid...' The papers were filled with information related to Atletico Madrid, a strong team from La Liga. It was a compilation of information requested from the club and information he had found himself. 'It's a strong team.' It was the team they would face in the Champions League final. Naturally, it was a strong team. If it weren't a strong team, it wouldn't have made it to the Champions League final. That's why Shin Jaewook focused even more on analyzing Atletico Madrid. Time passed. He was willing to invest even more time if he could find even one more weakness in the opponent. How many hours had passed? After focusing on the papers for a while, Shin Jaewook finally got up from the bed. After several days of dedication, he had successfully memorized all the information related to Atletico Madrid. And he came to two conclusions. \\"It's going to be hard to make it an interesting game.\\" The first was the conviction that the game against Atletico Madrid would not be fun. \\"There's not much you can do against a team that locks the door.\\" And the second was. \\"But I'll get to taste the Champions League victory after a long time.\\" The conviction that they could win against Atletico Madrid."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It seems you want to translate something to English but have not provided the text you wish to translate.

으흐흐흐! 재욱신이 그렇게 말하니까 완전 뿌듯한데?” “재욱신? 그건 또 뭐야? 갑자기 왜 외국인들이 이름 부르듯이 말하냐.” “엥? 이거 몰라? 요즘 한국팬들이 너 부를 때, 재욱신이라고 하잖아. 재욱이라는 이름이랑 말 그대로 신을 뜻하는 ‘신’을 붙여서 재욱신.” “아 최근엔 한국 팬들 반응을 못 봤어. 그럼 재욱GOD이라는 뜻인 거지?” “바로 그거지!” “…이건 좀 민망한데.” “민망하긴 왜 민망해. 리오넬 메시도 메신이라고 불리잖아.” “그건 메시잖아.” “너도 요즘 포스로는 안 꿀리잖아.” “……됐고, 팬분들한테 인사하러 가자.” 신재욱은 화제를 돌렸다. 리오넬 메시와의 비교는 민망했으니까. 환생 전이라면 모를까, 아직은 한참이나 이르다고 생각했다. 꾸준함에서 큰 차이가 나니까. ‘적어도 3시즌은 더 잘해야만 비빌 수 있지 않을까.’ 물론 그럴 수 있다는 자신감은 있었다. * * 챔피언스리그 결승 진출이 확정된 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨은 분데스리가에서도 연승을 이어갔다. 연승에 가장 큰 역할을 한 선수는 이제는 명실상부 에이스가 된 신재욱이었다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 함부르크에게 7 대 0 대승!」 「홈구장에서 굴욕적인 패배한 함부르크, 신재욱을 막지 못한 대가는 컸다.」 「신재욱, 함부르크전에서 4개의 공격포인트 기록! 3개의 골과 1개의 도움으로 분데스리가 최고의 스트라이커다운 경기 펼쳐!」 「바이에른 뮌헨, 슈투트가르트에게 4 대 0 승리!」 「신재욱, 1골 2도움 기록하며 뛰어난 활약 펼쳐!」 「완벽한 경기력으로 슈투트가르트의 수비진을 무너뜨린 신재욱, 또다시 분데스리가의 득점왕 됐다!」 연승을 거둔 바이에른 뮌헨에겐 자연스레 분데스리가 우승도 따라왔다. 「바이에른 뮌헨, 2013/14시즌 분데스리가 우승!」 「우승컵 ‘마이스터샬레’를 들어 올리는 신재욱! 전 세계를 놀라게 한 한국인 소년, 이제는 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스가 됐다!」 「천재 신재욱, 두 시즌 연속 분데스리가 득점왕에 올라!」 「분데스리가 무패 우승 이뤄낸 바이에른 뮌헨! 챔피언스리그 우승까지 해내나?」 분데스리가 우승을 거두고, 득점왕을 해낸 지금. 독일 현지에서 신재욱을 향한 관심은 대단했다. 축구와 관련된 이야기가 나올 때면 ‘신재욱’이라는 이름이 빠지지 않을 정도였다. 독일 현지뿐만 아니라 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심도 대단했다. 이들은 신재욱이 어린 나이에 바이에른 뮌헨의 에이스가 되었다는 사실에도 놀랐지만, 신재욱이 이번 시즌에 기록한 공격포인트의 숫자에 더욱 놀라움을 드러냈다. └ 34경기 49골 27어시스트??? 신재욱 얘 사람 맞냐? └ 더 놀라운 게 뭔지 알아? 얘 겨우 18살이라는 거야. └ 지난 시즌엔 20경기 36골 19어시스트였고, 이번 시즌엔 34경기 49골 27어시스트를 했어. 근데 얘보고 거품이라고 했던 멍청이들은 어디로 도망갔을까? └ 신재욱은 의심할 수 없는 월드클래스야. 얘보고 월드클래스 아니라고 하는 바보들은 그냥 신재욱이 너무 빨리 월드클래스가 돼서 인정하기 싫은 것뿐이야. 그게 아니면 인종차별주의자들이던가. └ 만 18세에 분데스리가 득점왕 2회에 분데스리가 우승 2회라는 커리어라니…… 게다가 챔피언스리그 우승까지 앞두고 있잖아? 이 정도면 이번 2014년에 가장 핫한 선수라고 말해도 되겠어. └ 챔피언스리그 우승은 아직 모르는 일이지. 근데 굳이 챔피언스리그 우승 커리어가 아니더라도 신재욱은 세계 최고의 공격수 중 하나가 맞아. 분데스리가 두 시즌 연속 득점왕이잖아. 그것만으로도 증명이 된 거지. └ 34경기에 나와서 49골 27어시스트라니…… 모르는 사람이 보면 분데스리가가 쉬운 리그인 줄 알겠어. └ 분데스리가가 강력한 리그라는 건 이번 챔피언스리그를 보면 알잖아? 레알 마드리드도 바이에른 뮌헨에게 무너진 거 못 본 사람 없지? └ 신재욱이 신계의 문을 강하게 두드리고 있구만! 분데스리가 34경기 49골 27어시스트. 신재욱이 이번 2013/14시즌에 만들어낸 기록이었다. 압도적인 골 숫자로 득점왕에 올랐고, 어시스트의 숫자 또한 분데스리가 최고였다. 신재욱이 팬들과 전문가들 사이에서 이번 시즌 분데스리가 최고의 선수로 뽑힌 것도 이상한 일이 아니었다. 「신재욱, 팬들의 투표에서 2013/14시즌 분데스리가 최고의 선수로 뽑혀!」 이러한 사실에 한국 축구팬들 역시 가만히 있지 못했다. 같은 한국인이 유럽에서 엄청난 활약을 한다는 사실에 커다란 관심을 드러냈다. └ 신재욱 왜 이렇게 잘하냐? 한국인이 분데스리가에서 두 시즌 연속 득점왕을 할 수가 있는 거였어?ㄷㄷㄷ └ 난 신재욱이 분데스리가에서 잘하는 건 알고 있었지만, 챔피언스리그에서까지도 이렇게 잘할 줄은 몰랐어. 맨체스터 유나이티드랑 레알 마드리드를 상대로도 그냥 개쩔던데? └ 신재욱은 신기할 정도로 노련해. 그냥 천재라는 말로는 부족한 게, 얜 경험이 많아야만 할 수 있는 플레이를 한다니까? └ 나 유럽에서 여행 중인데, 신재욱 인기 장난 아니더라. 그냥 신재욱 이름만 꺼내면 바로 인싸되는 거야. └ 영국에서도 신재욱은 엄청 유명해졌어. 내가 듣기론 영국의 빅클럽들이 가장 영입하길 원하는 공격수라던데? └ 그럴 만도 하지. 거의 완벽한 공격수잖아. 신재욱은 발이 빠르지 않다는 걸 제외하면 단점이 없어. └ 발이 빠르지 않은 단점도 타이밍으로 커버하잖아. 걍 완벽한 공격수임. └ 아마 몇 년 뒤엔 리오넬 메시나 크리스티아누 호날두보다 높은 평가를 받을 수도? └ 그러려면 발롱도르는 타야지. └ 머지않아 발롱도르도 탈 듯. 그리고 만약 신재욱이 챔피언스리그에서 우승한다면 이번 시즌에 발롱도르 받을 수도 있어. 리오넬 메시나 크리스티아누 호날두가 엄청 잘하긴 하지만, 이번 시즌만큼은 신재욱의 커리어가 더 좋은 것 같거든. └ 딱 이번 시즌만 놓고 보면 신재욱도 최고는 맞아. 분데스리가 우승이라는 타이틀을 거머쥔 이후. 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 일주일간 컨디션 회복에 집중했다. 훈련을 최소한으로 줄이며 휴식에 신경을 썼다. 챔피언스리그 결승전까지 남은 시간이 많은 편이었기에 가능한 일이었다. “얼마 만에 이렇게 쉬는 건지.” 침대에 누운 신재욱이 두꺼운 서류로 시선을 옮겼다. 그는 다른 선수들이 휴식을 취할 때도 지금처럼 상대를 분석했다. 웬만해선 아무것도 안 하고 누워있는 경우가 없었다. 상대 선수들의 정보를 외우고, 상대 선수들과 관련된 영상을 하나라도 더 찾아봤다. 신재욱에게는 그것만으로도 충분히 쉬는 것이었다. 그리고 그런 모습을 이해할 수 없다는 표정으로 바라보는 사람도 있었다. “재욱아.” “왜?” “안 지겨워? 쉴 땐 그냥 푹 쉬고 싶지 않아?” “지겹긴 무슨. 그리고 지금 쉬고 있잖아.” 이택현은 혀를 내둘렀다. “너의 이런 모습은 봐도 봐도 적응이 안 돼. 어떻게 사람이 이렇게까지 축구만 생각할 수가 있지? 재욱아, 네 머릿속엔 축구밖에 없냐?” “축구만 생각하려고 노력하는 거지.” “그게 노력으로 되는 거였어……? 재욱아, 쉴 땐 좀 푹 쉬기도 해. 저번에 과르디올라 감독님도 네가 너무 축구에만 몰두하는 것 같다고 쉴 땐 쉬라고 하셨잖아.” “난 이게 쉬는 거야.” “어이구 그러시겠죠. 나중에 피곤하다고 해도 난 모른다.” 고개를 절레절레 흔드는 이택현을 보며 미소를 지은 뒤, 신재욱은 다시 손에 쥔 서류를 바라봤다. ‘아틀레티코 마드리드라…….’ 서류엔 라리가의 강팀 아틀레티코 마드리드와 관련된 정보가 빼곡하게 적혀있었다. 구단에 요청해서 받은 정보들과 직접 찾은 정보들을 모아놓은 자료였다. ‘강한 팀이지.’ 챔피언스리그 결승전에서 만나게 될 팀이었다. 당연히 강팀이었다. 강팀이 아니라면 챔피언스리그 결승이라는 위치에 오를 수 없으니까. 그래서 신재욱은 아틀레티코 마드리드를 분석하는 것에 더욱 집중했다. 시간은 계속 흘렀다. 상대의 약점을 하나라도 더 찾아낼 수 있다면 더 많은 시간도 투자할 생각이었다. 몇 시간이나 흘렀을까? 한참을 서류에 집중하던 신재욱이 드디어 침대에서 몸을 일으켰다. 며칠간 매달린 끝에 아틀레티코 마드리드에 관련된 정보를 머릿속에 전부 넣는 것에 성공했다. 그리고 두 가지 확신을 하게 됐다. “재밌는 경기를 만들기는 어렵겠어.” 첫 번째로는 아틀레티코 마드리드와의 경기는 재미가 없을 거라는 확신이었다. “문을 걸어 잠그는 팀을 상대론 할 수 있는 게 많지 않으니까.” 그리고 두 번째로는. “그래도 오랜만에 챔피언스리그 우승 맛 좀 보겠네.” 아틀레티코 마드리드에게 승리할 수 있다는 확신이었다.","output":"179 * * The moment when the match ended and the Champions League final qualification was confirmed. - Bayern Munich players are celebrating! It was a tough match, but in the end, they brought down Real Madrid, the strongest team, to reach the Champions League final! - Ah~! It really was a legendary match. Both teams poured out everything, delighting the eyes of soccer fans all over the world! The winner has been decided, but I want to applaud the Real Madrid players who did their best! The Bayern Munich players were beaming with bright smiles. Being able to aim for the Champions League win brought them great joy. \\"This feeling, it's something I can't get used to.\\" Sin Jaewook's lips twitched. He couldn't contain the laughter that kept spilling out. Even if he had many Champions League wins under his belt from before his reincarnation, he always felt joy when advancing to the finals. Despite his experience, he never managed to feel indifferent even once. \\"The cheers of the fans are the same.\\" Sin Jaewook looked around. Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich's home stadium, now felt as comfortable as home. The roar of home fans filled the place, sounding like sweet music. His heart pounded, and he wanted to shout out in excitement, so overwhelmed by joy. Given how even the experienced Sin Jaewook felt like this, the response of the other players was even more intense. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who ran around the pitch as if he had forgotten how physically taxing the game was, as long as his eyes did not roll back in his head. Then he ran up to Sin Jaewook. \\"Jaewook! It's the finals! We made it to the Champions League finals! Wow, I feel really great!\\" \\"We have to win it all.\\" \\"Of course! Jaewook, honestly, I was a bit nervous playing as an attacking midfielder today, but I did quite well, didn't I?\\" \\"You did enough.\\" Sin Jaewook nodded in response to Lee Taekhyun's question, asking if he played well. ‘Given it’s an unfamiliar position, he did a lot right.’ What position is an attacking midfielder? It's a position that can only be played well by those who are good at soccer itself. Especially in Bayern Munich, where some of the best players in the world are gathered, you have to be incredibly skilled to play as an attacking midfielder. And yet, 18-year-old Lee Taekhyun played as an attacking midfielder in the Champions League final. It was only natural to feel burdened, and it would have been normal not to do well. But still, he did well. To be precise, he played an acceptable game, but even that was remarkable. \\"You did enough? Eurhurhurhu! If Jaewook Shin says so, that makes me really proud!\\" \\"Jaewook Shin? What's that supposed to mean? Why are you talking to me as if you're a foreigner calling my name?\\" \\"Huh? You don't know? These days, Korean fans call you 'Jaewook Shin.' It combines your name 'Jaewook' and 'Shin,' which also means 'god.'\\" \\"Oh, I haven't seen the reactions from the Korean fans lately. Does that mean like Jaewook GOD?\\" \\"Exactly!\\" \\"…That's a bit embarrassing.\\" \\"Why's it embarrassing? Lionel Messi is also called 'Messiah.'\\" \\"That's Messi.\\" \\"You're not far behind as far as your current form goes.\\" \\"…Let's go and greet the fans.\\" Sin Jaewook changed the topic. The comparison with Lionel Messi was embarrassing because it felt too soon. There was still a big gap in consistency. ‘I’ll need to play well for at least three more seasons to match that.’ Of course, he had the confidence he could do it. * * After the confirmation of the Champions League final qualification. Bayern Munich continued their winning streak in the Bundesliga. The player who played the greatest role in the winning streak was Sin Jaewook, who had become the undisputed ace. \\"Bayern Munich crushes Hamburg 7-0!\\" \\"Hamburg suffers a humiliating defeat at home, unable to stop Sin Jaewook, and it cost them dearly.\\" \\"Sin Jaewook records 4 points in the match against Hamburg! 3 goals and 1 assist, displaying a magnificent game worthy of the Bundesliga's best striker!\\" \\"Bayern Munich triumphs over Stuttgart with a 4-0 victory!\\" \\"Sin Jaewook scores 1 goal and 2 assists, showing an outstanding performance!\\" \\"Sin Jaewook destroys Stuttgart's defence with his flawless game play, again crowned the top scorer of Bundesliga!\\" Naturally, the winning streak led Bayern Munich to win the Bundesliga, too. \\"Bayern Munich wins the 2013/14 Bundesliga!\\" \\"Sin Jaewook lifts the 'Meisterschale' trophy! The Korean boy who surprised the world, now the ace of Bayern Munich!\\" \\"Sin Jaewook becomes Bundesliga's top scorer for the second season in a row!\\" \\"Can Bayern Munich, who achieved an unbeaten Bundesliga championship, also win the Champions League?\\" Now that he had achieved the title of top scorer and won the Bundesliga. Interest in Sin Jaewook was incredible both locally in Germany and all over the world. Whenever football was mentioned, the name 'Sin Jaewook' was not left out. Football fans around the world were surprised not only by the fact that Sin Jaewook had become the ace of Bayern Munich at such a young age, but also by the number of points he scored this season. └ 34 matches, 49 goals, 27 assists??? Is Sin Jaewook even human? └ You know what's even more surprising? The guy is only 18 years old. └ Last season was 20 games, 36 goals, 19 assists, and this season 34 games, 49 goals, 27 assists. Where did all those idiots go who said he was all hype? └ There's no doubt Sin Jaewook is world-class. Those who deny it are just too upset to admit he became world-class so quickly or are racists. └ A career of being Bundesliga's top scorer twice and two championships at the age of 18... And he’s even up for the Champions League victory? This qualifies him as the hottest player of 2014. └ The Champions League win is still uncertain. But even without the Champions League career, Sin Jaewook is one of the world's best forwards. Being the leading scorer for two consecutive Bundesliga seasons proves that. └ 49 goals and 27 assists in 34 matches... Someone unfamiliar might think the Bundesliga is an easy league. └ Anyone watching this year's Champions League can tell how strong the Bundesliga is, right? Did anyone not see Real Madrid crumble against Bayern Munich? └ Sin Jaewook is knocking at the doorway of the gods! 34 matches, 49 goals, 27 assists. This was the record Sin Jaewook created for the 2013/14 season. His monumental number of goals secured him the position of top scorer, and he also had the highest number of assists in the Bundesliga. It was no strange fact that Sin Jaewook was voted as the best player of the Bundesliga season by fans and experts alike. \\"Sin Jaewook voted as the best player of the 2013/14 Bundesliga season by fan votes!\\" Korean football fans could not sit still, either. They showed great interest in the outstanding performance of a fellow Korean in Europe. └ Why is Sin Jaewook so good? Could a Korean really be the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons? DDD └ I knew Sin Jaewook was doing well in the Bundesliga, but I didn't expect him to do so well in the Champions League, too. Against Manchester United and Real Madrid, he was just amazing? └ Sin Jaewook is incredibly experienced for his age. It's not just that he's a genius; he plays like someone with a lot of experience. └ I'm currently travelling in Europe, and Sin Jaewook's popularity is no joke. You just mention his name, and you become an instant insider. └ Even in the UK, Sin Jaewook has become quite famous. I’ve heard he’s the forward the big clubs in England want the most. └ It makes sense. He’s almost the perfect striker. Apart from not being the fastest, Sin Jaewook practically has no weaknesses. └ Even that's covered by his timing. He's just the perfect striker. └ In a few years, maybe he'll be rated higher than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? └ Then he'll have to win the Ballon d'Or. └ It won't be long before he wins the Ballon d'Or. And if Sin Jaewook wins the Champions League, he could even win this season's Ballon d'Or. Messi and Ronaldo are performing incredibly well, but this season Sin Jaewook's career seems better. └ If you only consider this season, Sin Jaewook is indeed the best. After clinching the Bundesliga title. Bayern Munich players focused on recovering their condition for a week. They reduced training to a minimum and focused on rest. There was plenty of time left until the Champions League final. \\"How long has it been since I've rested like this?\\" Lying on his bed, Sin Jaewook shifted his gaze to the thick stack of papers. Even when other players were resting, he analyzed the opponents just like this. There were hardly any cases where he just lay down doing nothing. He memorized information about the opposing players and sought to watch more videos related to them. For Sin Jaewook, that alone was enough of a rest. And there were those who looked at him with an expression that couldn't understand such zeal. \\"Jaewook.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Aren't you tired of it? Don't you just want to rest without thinking about anything?\\" \\"What do you mean tired? I’m resting right now.\\" Lee Taekhyun clicked his tongue. \\"I still can't get used to seeing you like this. How can someone be so single-minded about football? Jaewook, is football all you think about?\\" \\"I try to think only about football.\\" \\"I didn't realize that kind of focus was something you tried for... Jaewook, you should really rest when it's time to rest. Even Coach Guardiola said you're too focused on football, so you should rest.\\" \\"This is how I rest.\\" \\"Oh fine, whatever you say. Later, if you're tired, I don’t want to hear it.\\" After smiling at Lee Taekhyun, who was shaking his head in resignation, Sin Jaewook turned his attention back to the documents he held. 'Atlético Madrid…' The documents were filled with detailed information about Atlético Madrid, a strong team from La Liga. It was a compilation of information requested from the club and collected by searching himself. 'They're a strong team.' It was the team they would face in the Champions League final. Naturally, they were a formidable opponent. If they weren't strong, they wouldn't be in the position of reaching the Champions League final. Therefore, Sin Jaewook focused even more on analyzing Atlético Madrid. Time passed. He was willing to invest more time if he could find even one more weakness about the opponent. How much time had elapsed? Finally, after concentrating on the documents for a while, Sin Jaewook stood up from the bed. After days of persistence, he was successful in memorizing all the information about Atlético Madrid. And he came to two certainties. \\"It won't be an exciting game.\\" The first was that the game against Atlético Madrid wouldn't be enjoyable. \\"There's not much you can do against a team that locks the door.\\" And the second was. \\"But, it's been a while since I've gotten a taste of winning the Champions League.\\" It was the certainty that he could beat Atlético Madrid."},{"instruction":"180 * * * 환생 전부터 신재욱은 아틀레티코 마드리드의 스타일을 잘 알고 있었다. 특별히 아틀레티코 마드리드에 관심이 있어서는 아니었다. 아틀레티코 마드리드의 스타일이 잘 알려져 있었기 때문이었다. ‘매우 수비적인 스타일이지. 하지만 단순히 수비적이라고 말하기엔 짜임새가 있고, 역습도 꽤 날카로워.’ 선수들로 두 줄 수비벽을 세운다는 평을 받을 정도로 수비에 많은 신경을 쏟는 스타일. 물론 추후엔 약점이 발견되고, 한계가 드러나는 전술이지만. 현시점에선 디에고 시메오네 감독이 이끄는 아틀레티코 마드리드는 세계 최고의 수비력을 지닌 팀이라는 평을 받고 있다. 성적도 대단했다. ‘이번 시즌 라리가 우승팀이니까.’ 2013/14시즌 라리가 우승! 아틀레티코 마드리드가 이뤄낸 업적이었다. 즉, 이번 챔피언스리그 결승전은 분데스리가 우승팀과 라리가 우승팀의 대결이기도 했다. 당연하게도 이 경기는 축구팬들 사이에서 더 많은 화제가 됐다. └ 라리가 우승팀이랑 분데스리가 우승팀이 만나네. 현재 최고의 팀들끼리 만난 거라고 봐도 되겠지? └ 맞지. 이번 시즌만큼은 시메오네 감독이 이끄는 아틀레티코 마드리드가 라리가 최강이고, 과르디올라 감독이 이끄는 바이에른 뮌헨도 분데스리가 최강이지. └ 이 경기는 너무 기대된다. 라리가 최강팀과 분데스리가 최강팀의 대결이라니! └ 난 바이에른 뮌헨이 이길 것 같아. 4강에서 레알 마드리드도 잡았잖아. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드도 리그에서 레알 마드리드 이겼어. └ 난 아틀레티코 마드리드가 이길 것 같아. 얘네 수비는 철벽이야. 절대 뚫리지 않을 것 같은 느낌을 준다고. └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진은 세계 최고 수준이긴 한데, 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비 전술엔 고전할 수밖에 없을 거야. └ 신재욱은 무조건 골 넣을걸? 만약 이택현이랑 같이 나온다? 그러면 100%야. 신재욱과 이택현의 호흡은 세계 최고거든. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드도 엄청 강한 팀이라서 이번 결승전은 누가 이길지 모르겠다. 다른 팀도 아니고 첼시를 이기고 올라왔잖아. 그것도 꽤 압도적으로. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드와 첼시의 2차전은 장난 아니었지. 아틀레티코 마드리드가 공격력도 강한 팀이라는 걸 알 수 있었어. 이처럼 팬들의 관심과 기대감이 높아서일까? 결승전이 치러질 날은 빠르게 다가왔다. ― 선수들이 경기장에 입장하고 있습니다! 오늘 이 두 팀 중 한 팀이 챔피언스리그 우승컵을 들게 됩니다! ― 긴장감이 흐르고 있습니다! 두 팀 모두 최고의 기세를 지닌 팀이고, 각자의 리그에서 우승을 한 팀들이기 때문에 승부를 예측하기가 어렵습니다! ― 양 팀의 스쿼드를 보겠습니다. 오늘 바이에른 뮌헨은 최근 레알 마드리드를 이겼던 전술을 그대로 들고나왔죠? ― 그렇습니다. 필립 람 선수와 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거 선수를 수비형 미드필더에 세우고, 양쪽 윙어 자리에 프랑크 리베리와 토마스 뮐러를, 공격형 미드필더 자리엔 이택현, 최전방 스트라이커 자리엔 신재욱 선수를 세웠습니다. 베스트 멤버죠. ― 레알 마드리드전을 생각해보면 이택현 선수와 신재욱 선수의 역할이 매우 중요할 것 같네요. ― 두 선수는 워낙 호흡이 좋은 선수들이니까요. 좋은 경기력을 보여줄 것 같습니다. 다음으로 아틀레티코 마드리드를 보시면 평소와 같이 4―4―2 포메이션을 들고나왔거든요? 그런데 평소랑은 조금 다른 게, 오늘의 아틀레티코 마드리드는 더 공격적으로 전술을 짜온 것 같습니다. 디에고 코스타 선수와 다비드 비야 선수를 투톱으로 세웠고, 아르다 투란, 가비, 코케 선수를 평소보다 더 앞쪽에 배치했거든요? 이건 디에고 시메오네 감독이 초반부터 바이에른 뮌헨을 강하게 몰아붙일 생각인 것 같습니다! ― 많은 수의 팬분들은 아틀레티코 마드리드가 수비적인 전술을 들고나올 거라고 예상했는데, 그 예상을 완전히 깨버린 디에고 시메오네 감독이네요! 이러면 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들도 당황할 수 있겠는데요? 해설들의 말처럼 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 당황하고 있었다. 아틀레티코 마드리드의 전술이 생각했던 것과는 달랐으니까. ‘디에고 시메오네 감독이 잘 준비했네.’ 신재욱도 작게 감탄했다. 모두의 예상을 깬 전술을 들고나온 디에고 시메오네 감독이 대단하게 느껴졌다. 하지만 거기까지였다. 위기를 느끼진 않았다. ‘선수들에게 익숙하지 않은 전술은 오히려 독이 될 수 있지.’ 리그 내내 사용하던 전술 말고 다른 전술을 사용하는 아틀레티코 마드리드가 강할 것 같지는 않았으니까. 오히려 기분이 좋아졌다. ‘금방 원래 전술로 돌아가게 해줘야겠어.’ 상대의 수비를 뚫는 게 예상보다 더 쉬워지겠다는 생각이 들었으니까. * * * 삐이이익! 바이에른 뮌헨과 아틀레티코 마드리드. 챔피언스리그 결승전에 오른 두 팀이 부딪쳤다. ― 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들이 적극적으로 공격을 시도하고 있습니다! 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들의 활동량이 평소보다 더 많은 것 같은데요? ― 정말 그렇네요. 아틀레티코 마드리드는 원래도 활동량이 많은 것으로 유명한 팀인데, 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대하는 오늘은 정말 많이 뛰네요! 아틀레티코 마드리드는 강한 체력을 바탕으로 경기장을 넓게 쓰며 공격을 만들어 나갔다. 빠른 템포를 유지하고 있음에도 라리가에서 우승한 팀답게 패스의 정확도가 높았고, 뒷공간을 노리는 스루패스도 날카로웠다. 하지만 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비도 단단했다. 상대가 예상과는 다른 전술을 들고나왔지만, 금방 침착함을 되찾곤 안정적으로 대응했다. ― 필립 람 선수! 중원에서 선수들을 진두지휘하며 안정감을 보여주고 있습니다! 역시 바이에른 뮌헨의 레전드답네요! 세계 최고의 측면 수비수에서 이제는 호셉 과르디올라 감독 체제에서 수비형 미드필더로도 완벽한 모습을 보여주고 있는 대단한 선수입니다. ― 필립 람 선수뿐만 아니라 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들의 집중력이 다 좋네요. 결승전이 치러질 때까지 푹 쉬다 와서 그런지 4강전 때보다 컨디션이 더 좋아 보입니다. ― 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수도 몸이 가벼워 보이죠? ― 그렇습니다. 특히 이택현 선수는 힘이 남아도는 것 같습니다. 과할 정도로 수비 가담을 해주고 있거든요? ― 하하하! 이택현 선수는 체력이 워낙 좋은 것으로 유명하니까요. 저렇게 뛰어도 풀타임을 무리 없이 소화하는 선수이지 않습니까. 필립 람과 슈바인슈타이거는 안정적인 수비를 보여주며 바이에른 뮌헨의 중심을 잡아줬고, 토마스 뮐러, 이택현, 프랑크 리베리가 수비에 가담하며 힘을 실어줬다. 아틀레티코 마드리드의 공격진을 이끄는 디에고 코스타, 다비드 비야, 아르다 투란, 가비, 코케는 그런 바이에른 뮌헨을 쉽게 공략하지 못했다. ― 필립 람이 끊어냅니다! 이야! 패스 경로를 완전히 읽었어요! 공을 끊어낸 필립 람은 곧바로 전진 패스를 뿌렸다. 패스에 자신이 있는 선수답게 과감한 시도였다. 투욱! 전방에 있던 이택현이 공을 받아냈다. 부드럽게 공을 받아낸 그는 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비수 미란다와의 몸싸움을 이겨내고 측면에서 달리는 토마스 뮐러에게 패스했다. ― 토마스 뮐러가 측면에서 공을 받습니다. 이택현 선수가 잘 연결해줬네요! 토마스 뮐러는 상대 수비수와의 일대일 상황에서 돌파를 시도하지 않았다. 그가 공을 끄는 사이에 측면으로 침투하던 하피냐에게 공을 넘겨줬다. ― 좋은 패스입니다! 하피냐 선수가 공을 잡습니다! 좋은 오버래핑으로 측면을 뚫어낸 하피냐는 곧바로 크로스까지 뿌려냈다. 퍼엉! 공이 휘어지며 아틀레티코 마드리드의 페널티박스 안으로 날아 들어왔다. 페널티박스 안에 있던 선수들이 다급히 몸을 띄웠다. 신재욱도 마찬가지였다. 어느새 가장 좋은 위치를 잡은 그는 공중에 몸을 띄운 채, 공에 집중했다. 상대 수비수의 방해가 있었지만, 강하게 뿌리쳐내며 날아오는 공에 머리를 가져다 댔다. 터엉! 이마와 공이 부딪쳤을 때 나는 타격음이 터졌다. 그러나 신재욱의 표정은 좋지 못했다. “아…….” 느낌으로 알았기 때문이었다. 빗맞았다는 것을. ― 아……! 이게 벗어나네요! 정말 아깝습니다! ― 신재욱 선수가 머리를 잘 가져다 댔는데, 살짝 빗맞았습니다. 신재욱 선수가 아쉬워하고 있네요. 비록 골이 터지진 않았지만. 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들의 등줄기엔 식은땀이 흘렀다. 이들에겐 세계 최강의 수비력을 지닌 팀이라는 자부심이 있었기에, 단 한 번의 공격으로 실점을 할 뻔했다는 것에 깜짝 놀라고 있었다. ‘고딘을 상대로 공중볼을 따낸다고? 신재욱 저 자식, 엄청나잖아……?’ ‘역시 토마스 뮐러는 영리한 선수야. 침투하는 하피냐를 정확하게 보고 패스했어. 그리고 하피냐의 크로스도 꽤 날카로웠고.’ ‘바이에른 뮌헨의 공격이 생각보다 더 강한데……? 하마터면 경기 초반부터 골을 먹힐 뻔했어.’ ‘이미 알고 있었지만, 확실히 신재욱의 위치선정은 위협적이야. 더 집중해서 막지 않으면 큰일 나겠어.’ 첫 번째 슈팅 이후부터 바이에른 뮌헨이 기세를 잡아나갔다. 신재욱은 최전방에서 공을 잡을 때마다 안정적으로 지켜내며 동료에게 연결해줬고, 이택현은 번뜩이는 플레이로 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비진을 위협했다. 그리고 전반 19분이 되었을 때. 줄곧 안정적인 플레이를 하던 신재욱이 또다시 공을 받아냈다. 원래라면 수비수를 등진 채로 공을 받고, 측면으로 달리는 프랑크 리베리나 토마스 뮐러에게 패스를 줬을 것이다. 그게 아니면 다시 이택현에게 공을 넘기던가. 그런데 지금은 달랐다. 계속해서 비슷한 패턴으로 움직이던 신재욱이 갑자기 몸을 돌렸다. 당연히 신재욱이 공을 지킬 것이라고 예상했던 아틀레티코 마드리드의 중앙수비수 디에고 고딘은 깜짝 놀라며 팔을 뻗었다. 우선은 몸으로라도 신재욱의 움직임을 방해할 생각이었다. 그러나 신재욱은 디에고 고딘의 팔을 뿌리쳐내며 중심을 잡았다. 동시에 다리를 휘둘렀다. 기습적인 턴과 거의 같은 타이밍에 나온 슈팅. 그 예상치 못한 플레이에 아틀레티코 마드리드의 골키퍼 티보 쿠르투아는 미처 몸을 날리지 못했다. 깜짝 놀라며 몸을 움직이려고 했지만. 공은 이미 그의 몸을 지나 골대 안으로 파고들었다. 철썩! 골망이 크게 흔들릴 정도로 강력한 슈팅이었다. 그 순간 경기장에 커다란 함성이 터져 나왔다. ― 우오오오오! 들어갔습니드아아아아아! 고오오오오올! 신재욱입니다! 신재욱 선수가 엄청난 슈팅으로 세계 최강이라고 평가받는 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비를 뚫어내고 골을 터트렸습니다! ― 이런 한 방이죠! 신재욱 선수에겐 이런 한 방이 있습니다! 정말 대단한 심리전이었습니다! 줄곧 수비수를 등지는 포스트 플레이만 하다가, 처음으로 기습적인 터닝슛을 시도한 것이거든요? 그런데 그게 골로 연결되네요! ― 디에고 고딘 선수를 완벽하게 속이고 만들어낸 골! 티보 쿠르투아 골키퍼도 반응하지 못했을 정도로 빠른 타이밍에 나온 슈팅이었습니다! 투웅! 퉁! 아틀레티코 마드리드의 골망을 경쾌하게 흔들던 공이 바닥에 튕겼다. 신재욱은 평소처럼 그 공을 옆구리에 낀 채, 경기장 중앙을 향해 뛰었다. 이때, 그의 눈엔 보였다. 특성이 성장했다는 메시지와 능력치가 올랐다는 메시지가. ‘챔피언스리그 결승전은 다를 것 같았어.’","output":"180 * * * Since before his reincarnation, Sin Jaewook was well aware of Atlético Madrid's style. It wasn't because he had a particular interest in Atlético Madrid, but because their style was well-known. \\"Very defensive in style. However, to simply call it defensive would understate their tactical cohesion and their counter-attacks can be quite sharp.\\" Their style was known for heavily focusing on defense with two lines of player walls, so much so that it earned such descriptions. Of course, eventually weaknesses and limitations of their tactics were discovered. But at this point in time, under the leadership of Diego Simeone, Atlético Madrid was regarded as the team with the best defense in the world. Their performance was also impressive. \\"They won La Liga this season.\\" La Liga champions for the 2013/14 season! This was an achievement managed by Atlético Madrid. Thus, the Champions League final was also a clash between the Bundesliga champions and La Liga champions. Understandably, this match became an even bigger topic among football fans. └ The La Liga champions meet the Bundesliga champions. Can we say these are the best teams right now? └ Right. This season, Simeone's Atlético Madrid is the strongest in La Liga, and Guardiola's Bayern Munich is also the strongest in the Bundesliga. └ I'm really looking forward to this game. A clash between the strongest teams of La Liga and Bundesliga! └ I think Bayern Munich will win. They even beat Real Madrid in the semifinals. └ Atlético Madrid also won against Real Madrid in the league. └ I think Atlético Madrid is going to win. Their defense is just a fortress, it feels unbreakable. └ Bayern Munich's attack is one of the best in the world, but they will struggle against Atlético Madrid's defensive tactics. └ Won’t Sin Jaewook just score anyway? Especially if he plays with Lee Taekhyun – then it’s a 100% chance. Their synergy is the best in the world. └ Atlético Madrid is a tough team too, so this final is unpredictable. They advanced beating Chelsea, and quite dominantly too. └ Atlético Madrid's second-leg game against Chelsea was no joke. It demonstrated that they have a strong attack as well. Perhaps because of the mounting interest and anticipation from the fans? The day of the final approached rapidly. \\"The players are entering the pitch! Today, one of these two teams will lift the Champions League trophy!\\" \\"There's tension in the air! Both teams are in prime condition and since they've won their respective leagues, it's hard to predict the outcome!\\" \\"Let's look at the squad for both teams. Today, Bayern Munich has brought the same tactics that they used to defeat Real Madrid, right?\\" \\"That's correct. They've placed Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger as defensive midfielders, with Franck Ribéry and Thomas Müller as wingers, Lee Taekhyun as an attacking midfielder, and Sin Jaewook as the foremost striker. It's their best lineup.\\" \\"Considering the match against Real Madrid, the roles of Lee Taekhyun and Sin Jaewook seem very important.\\" \\"Since both players have great synergy, we expect them to demonstrate a fine performance. Turning to Atlético Madrid, they've come out with their usual 4-4-2 formation, right? But there's a slight difference – today's Atlético Madrid seems more offensive in their strategy. They've placed Diego Costa and David Villa as the front two, and Arda Turan, Gabi, and Koke appear to be placed further forward than usual. This looks like Diego Simeone's intent to aggressively pressure Bayern Munich right from the start!\\" \\"Many fans expected Atlético Madrid to come out with a defensive strategy, but Diego Simeone has completely overturned those expectations! Bayern Munich players might be taken aback by this!\\" Just as the commentators said, Bayern Munich players were caught off guard. Atlético Madrid's tactics differed from what was expected. \\"Diego Simeone has prepared well.\\" Sin Jaewook also quietly admired the work. Diego Simeone impressed him by coming out with tactics that defied everyone's expectations. But that was it. He didn’t feel cornered. \\"Unfamiliar tactics could turn out to be a poison for them.\\" Atlético Madrid didn't seem strong using different tactics than what they usually did in the league. Instead, it cheered him up. \\"I have to quickly make them revert to their original strategy.\\" He thought it might be easier to break through their defense than expected. * * * Whistle! Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid clashed in the Champions League final. \\"Atlético Madrid players are actively trying to attack! It seems like they're running more than usual?\\" \\"Indeed. Atlético Madrid is already known for their high work rate, but they seem to be particularly energetic against Bayern Munich today!\\" Atlético Madrid built their attacks using strong stamina to cover the wide expanse of the pitch. Despite the fast pace, they maintained a high pass accuracy befitting a La Liga champion team, and their through passes aiming for the back space were sharp. However, Bayern Munich's defense was also solid. Even though the opponent came out with unexpected tactics, they quickly regained composure and responded steadily. \\"Philipp Lahm takes command in midfield and provides stability! Truly a legend of Bayern Munich! Once the world's best full-back, he is now also showing an impeccable performance as a defensive midfielder under coach Pep Guardiola.\\" \\"Not only Philipp Lahm but all Bayern Munich players are focused. Maybe because they fully rested until the final, they seem in better condition than during the semi-finals.\\" \\"Do Sin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun seem lighter on their feet too?\\" \\"Yes, especially Lee Taekhyun. He seems to have plenty of energy left. He's involving himself in defense almost excessively?\\" \\"Haha! Well, Lee Taekhyun is known for his stamina. He can play full-time without any issues even after running like that.\\" Philipp Lahm and Schweinsteiger provided a stable defense at the heart of Bayern Munich, while Thomas Müller, Lee Taekhyun, and Franck Ribéry aided in defense. Diego Costa, David Villa, Arda Turan, Gabi, and Koke, who led Atlético Madrid's frontline, couldn't easily strategize against Bayern Munich. \\"Philipp Lahm intercepts! Wow! He read the pass route completely!\\" Having intercepted the ball, Lahm immediately threw a forward pass. As a player confident with his passing, it was a daring attempt. Thump! Lee Taekhyun in the front received the ball. He smoothly controlled the ball, overcame the tussle against Atlético Madrid's defender Miranda, and passed to Thomas Müller running along the flank. \\"Thomas Müller receives the ball on the side. A good connection by Lee Taekhyun!\\" Instead of attempting to break through in a one-on-one situation against the opposing defender, Müller passed to the infiltrating Rafinha while holding the ball. \\"Great pass! Rafinha gets the ball!\\" Rafinha, who opened up the flank with good overlapping, immediately sent out a cross. Thwack! The ball curved in into Atlético Madrid's penalty box. The players in the box desperately leaped. Sin Jaewook did the same. He had already taken the best position, focused on the ball as he went airborne. Despite interference from an opponent defender, he powerfully shrugged them off and connected his head to the incoming ball. Bam! The sound of impact between forehead and ball erupted. However, Sin Jaewook's expression wasn’t good. “Ah…” He knew the feeling. It had been mishit. \\"Ah…! It’s just wide! Such a close attempt!\\" \\"Sin Jaewook had a good header, but it slightly deviated. Sin Jaewook seems frustrated.\\" Even though there was no goal, sweat rolled down the backs of Atlético Madrid players. They had pride in having the world's strongest defense, so they were startled at nearly conceding from just one attack. 'Winning a header against Godín? Sin Jaewook, that guy, he's incredible…?' 'Thomas Müller is such a clever player. He perfectly exploited Rafinha's run and executed the pass. And Rafinha's cross was pretty sharp, too.' 'We underestimated Bayern Munich's attack…? We almost conceded a goal right at the start of the game.' 'I knew it, but Sin Jaewook's positioning is definitely threatening. We need to focus more or we're in big trouble.' After the first shot, Bayern Munich started to dominate. Sin Jaewook consistently held on to the ball in front and connected it to his teammates, while Lee Taekhyun threatened Atlético Madrid's defenders with his dazzling play. And then, at the 19th minute of the first half. Sin Jaewook, who had been playing stable, received the ball again. Normally, he would have taken the ball with his back to the defenders and passed it to Franck Ribéry or Thomas Müller on the flanks. Otherwise, he would pass it back to Lee Taekhyun. But this time it was different. Continuously moving in a similar pattern, suddenly Sin Jaewook turned around. Diego Godín, Atlético Madrid's center-back, who had expected Sin Jaewook to hold onto the ball, was taken aback and stretched out his arm. His first thought was to obstruct Sin Jaewook's movement with his body. However, Sin Jaewook brushed off Diego Godín's arm and stabilized himself. Then he swung his leg. A shot came almost simultaneously with an unexpected turn. Caught by surprise, Atlético Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois wasn't able to throw his body in time. He frantically tried to move. But the ball had already passed him and burrowed into the net. Smack! It was a powerful shot that made the goal net shudder violently. At that moment, a huge roar erupted from the stadium. \\"Wowoooo! It’s in!! Goooooal! Sin Jaewook! With an incredible shot, Sin Jaewook has penetrated the defense of Atlético Madrid, who are considered to have the world's strongest defense!\\" \\"That’s the impact! Sin Jaewook has that kind of impact! An amazing psychological play! After consistently holding the ball and distributing it, he suddenly attempted a turning shot for the first time, and it led to a goal!\\" \\"A goal created by perfectly deceiving Diego Godín! The shot came so quickly that goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois couldn't react in time!\\" Twump! Thump! As Atlético Madrid's goal net vibrantly shook, the ball bounced off the ground. Sin Jaewook ran towards the center of the pitch as usual, with the ball under his arm. At that moment, he saw it. The message that his attributes had grown and his stats increased. \\"Champions League finals do feel different.\\""},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It seems like you have not provided any text to translate. Please provide the text you would like to have translated to English, and I'll be happy to help."},{"instruction":"179 * The moment when the match ended and the Champions League final qualification was confirmed. - Bayern Munich players are celebrating! It was a tough match, but in the end, they brought down Real Madrid, the strongest team, to reach the Champions League final! - Ah~! It really was a legendary match. Both teams poured out everything, delighting the eyes of soccer fans all over the world! The winner has been decided, but I want to applaud the Real Madrid players who did their best! The Bayern Munich players were beaming with bright smiles. Being able to aim for the Champions League win brought them great joy. “This feeling, it’s something I can’t get used to.” Sin Jaewook’s lips twitched. He couldn’t contain the laughter that kept spilling out. Even if he had many Champions League wins under his belt from before his reincarnation, he always felt joy when advancing to the finals. Despite his experience, he never managed to feel indifferent even once. “The cheers of the fans are the same.” Sin Jaewook looked around. Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich’s home stadium, now felt as comfortable as home. The roar of home fans filled the place, sounding like sweet music. His heart pounded, and he wanted to shout out in excitement, so overwhelmed by joy. Given how even the experienced Sin Jaewook felt like this, the response of the other players was even more intense. Especially Lee Taekhyun, who ran around the pitch as if he had forgotten how physically taxing the game was, as long as his eyes did not roll back in his head. Then he ran up to Sin Jaewook. “Jaewook! It’s the finals! We made it to the Champions League finals! Wow, I feel really great!” “We have to win it all.” “Of course! Jaewook, honestly, I was a bit nervous playing as an attacking midfielder today, but I did quite well, didn’t I?” “You did enough.” Sin Jaewook nodded in response to Lee Taekhyun’s question, asking if he played well. ‘Given it’s an unfamiliar position, he did a lot right.’ What position is an attacking midfielder? It’s a position that can only be played well by those who are good at soccer itself. Especially in Bayern Munich, where some of the best players in the world are gathered, you have to be incredibly skilled to play as an attacking midfielder. And yet, 18-year-old Lee Taekhyun played as an attacking midfielder in the Champions League final. It was only natural to feel burdened, and it would have been normal not to do well. But still, he did well. To be precise, he played an acceptable game, but even that was remarkable. “You did enough? Eurhurhurhu! If Jaewook Shin says so, that makes me really proud!” “Jaewook Shin? What’s that supposed to mean? Why are you talking to me as if you’re a foreigner calling my name?” “Huh? You don’t know? These days, Korean fans call you ‘Jaewook Shin.’ It combines your name ‘Jaewook’ and ‘Shin,’ which also means ‘god.’” “Oh, I haven’t seen the reactions from the Korean fans lately. Does that mean like Jaewook GOD?” “Exactly!” “…That’s a bit embarrassing.” “Why’s it embarrassing? Lionel Messi is also called ‘Messiah.’” “That’s Messi.” “You’re not far behind as far as your current form goes.” “…Let’s go and greet the fans.” Sin Jaewook changed the topic. The comparison with Lionel Messi was embarrassing because it felt too soon. There was still a big gap in consistency. ‘I’ll need to play well for at least three more seasons to match that.’ Of course, he had the confidence he could do it. * After the confirmation of the Champions League final qualification. Bayern Munich continued their winning streak in the Bundesliga. The player who played the greatest role in the winning streak was Sin Jaewook, who had become the undisputed ace. “Bayern Munich crushes Hamburg 7-0!” “Hamburg suffers a humiliating defeat at home, unable to stop Sin Jaewook, and it cost them dearly.” “Sin Jaewook records 4 points in the match against Hamburg! 3 goals and 1 assist, displaying a magnificent game worthy of the Bundesliga’s best striker!” “Bayern Munich triumphs over Stuttgart with a 4-0 victory!” “Sin Jaewook scores 1 goal and 2 assists, showing an outstanding performance!” “Sin Jaewook destroys Stuttgart’s defence with his flawless game play, again crowned the top scorer of Bundesliga!” Naturally, the winning streak led Bayern Munich to win the Bundesliga, too. “Bayern Munich wins the 2013/14 Bundesliga!” “Sin Jaewook lifts the ‘Meisterschale’ trophy! The Korean boy who surprised the world, now the ace of Bayern Munich!” “Sin Jaewook becomes Bundesliga’s top scorer for the second season in a row!” “Can Bayern Munich, who achieved an unbeaten Bundesliga championship, also win the Champions League?” Now that he had achieved the title of top scorer and won the Bundesliga. Interest in Sin Jaewook was incredible both locally in Germany and all over the world. Whenever football was mentioned, the name ‘Sin Jaewook’ was not left out. Football fans around the world were surprised not only by the fact that Sin Jaewook had become the ace of Bayern Munich at such a young age, but also by the number of points he scored this season. └ 34 matches, 49 goals, 27 assists??? Is Sin Jaewook even human? └ You know what’s even more surprising? The guy is only 18 years old. └ Last season was 20 games, 36 goals, 19 assists, and this season 34 games, 49 goals, 27 assists. Where did all those idiots go who said he was all hype? └ There’s no doubt Sin Jaewook is world-class. Those who deny it are just too upset to admit he became world-class so quickly or are racists. └ A career of being Bundesliga’s top scorer twice and two championships at the age of 18… And he’s even up for the Champions League victory? This qualifies him as the hottest player of 2014. └ The Champions League win is still uncertain. But even without the Champions League career, Sin Jaewook is one of the world’s best forwards. Being the leading scorer for two consecutive Bundesliga seasons proves that. └ 49 goals and 27 assists in 34 matches… Someone unfamiliar might think the Bundesliga is an easy league. └ Anyone watching this year’s Champions League can tell how strong the Bundesliga is, right? Did anyone not see Real Madrid crumble against Bayern Munich? └ Sin Jaewook is knocking at the doorway of the gods! 34 matches, 49 goals, 27 assists. This was the record Sin Jaewook created for the 2013/14 season. His monumental number of goals secured him the position of top scorer, and he also had the highest number of assists in the Bundesliga. It was no strange fact that Sin Jaewook was voted as the best player of the Bundesliga season by fans and experts alike. “Sin Jaewook voted as the best player of the 2013/14 Bundesliga season by fan votes!” Korean football fans could not sit still, either. They showed great interest in the outstanding performance of a fellow Korean in Europe. └ Why is Sin Jaewook so good? Could a Korean really be the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons? DDD └ I knew Sin Jaewook was doing well in the Bundesliga, but I didn’t expect him to do so well in the Champions League, too. Against Manchester United and Real Madrid, he was just amazing? └ Sin Jaewook is incredibly experienced for his age. It’s not just that he’s a genius; he plays like someone with a lot of experience. └ I’m currently travelling in Europe, and Sin Jaewook’s popularity is no joke. You just mention his name, and you become an instant insider. └ Even in the UK, Sin Jaewook has become quite famous. I’ve heard he’s the forward the big clubs in England want the most. └ It makes sense. He’s almost the perfect striker. Apart from not being the fastest, Sin Jaewook practically has no weaknesses. └ Even that’s covered by his timing. He’s just the perfect striker. └ In a few years, maybe he’ll be rated higher than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? └ Then he’ll have to win the Ballon d’Or. └ It won’t be long before he wins the Ballon d’Or. And if Sin Jaewook wins the Champions League, he could even win this season’s Ballon d’Or. Messi and Ronaldo are performing incredibly well, but this season Sin Jaewook’s career seems better. └ If you only consider this season, Sin Jaewook is indeed the best. After clinching the Bundesliga title. Bayern Munich players focused on recovering their condition for a week. They reduced training to a minimum and focused on rest. There was plenty of time left until the Champions League final. “How long has it been since I’ve rested like this?” Lying on his bed, Sin Jaewook shifted his gaze to the thick stack of papers. Even when other players were resting, he analyzed the opponents just like this. There were hardly any cases where he just lay down doing nothing. He memorized information about the opposing players and sought to watch more videos related to them. For Sin Jaewook, that alone was enough of a rest. And there were those who looked at him with an expression that couldn’t understand such zeal. “Jaewook.” “What?” “Aren’t you tired of it? Don’t you just want to rest without thinking about anything?” “What do you mean tired? I’m resting right now.” Lee Taekhyun clicked his tongue. “I still can’t get used to seeing you like this. How can someone be so single-minded about football? Jaewook, is football all you think about?” “I try to think only about football.” “I didn’t realize that kind of focus was something you tried for… Jaewook, you should really rest when it’s time to rest. Even Coach Guardiola said you’re too focused on football, so you should rest.” “This is how I rest.” “Oh fine, whatever you say. Later, if you’re tired, I don’t want to hear it.” After smiling at Lee Taekhyun, who was shaking his head in resignation, Sin Jaewook turned his attention back to the documents he held. ‘Atlético Madrid…’ The documents were filled with detailed information about Atlético Madrid, a strong team from La Liga. It was a compilation of information requested from the club and collected by searching himself. ‘They’re a strong team.’ It was the team they would face in the Champions League final. Naturally, they were a formidable opponent. If they weren’t strong, they wouldn’t be in the position of reaching the Champions League final. Therefore, Sin Jaewook focused even more on analyzing Atlético Madrid. Time passed. He was willing to invest more time if he could find even one more weakness about the opponent. How much time had elapsed? Finally, after concentrating on the documents for a while, Sin Jaewook stood up from the bed. After days of persistence, he was successful in memorizing all the information about Atlético Madrid. And he came to two certainties. “It won’t be an exciting game.” The first was that the game against Atlético Madrid wouldn’t be enjoyable. “There’s not much you can do against a team that locks the door.” And the second was. “But, it’s been a while since I’ve gotten a taste of winning the Champions League.” It was the certainty that he could beat Atlético Madrid.","output":"I apologize for the confusion, but it appears that you've already provided the English text.

└ 맞지. 이번 시즌만큼은 시메오네 감독이 이끄는 아틀레티코 마드리드가 라리가 최강이고, 과르디올라 감독이 이끄는 바이에른 뮌헨도 분데스리가 최강이지. └ 이 경기는 너무 기대된다. 라리가 최강팀과 분데스리가 최강팀의 대결이라니! └ 난 바이에른 뮌헨이 이길 것 같아. 4강에서 레알 마드리드도 잡았잖아. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드도 리그에서 레알 마드리드 이겼어. └ 난 아틀레티코 마드리드가 이길 것 같아. 얘네 수비는 철벽이야. 절대 뚫리지 않을 것 같은 느낌을 준다고. └ 바이에른 뮌헨의 공격진은 세계 최고 수준이긴 한데, 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비 전술엔 고전할 수밖에 없을 거야. └ 신재욱은 무조건 골 넣을걸? 만약 이택현이랑 같이 나온다? 그러면 100%야. 신재욱과 이택현의 호흡은 세계 최고거든. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드도 엄청 강한 팀이라서 이번 결승전은 누가 이길지 모르겠다. 다른 팀도 아니고 첼시를 이기고 올라왔잖아. 그것도 꽤 압도적으로. └ 아틀레티코 마드리드와 첼시의 2차전은 장난 아니었지. 아틀레티코 마드리드가 공격력도 강한 팀이라는 걸 알 수 있었어. 이처럼 팬들의 관심과 기대감이 높아서일까? 결승전이 치러질 날은 빠르게 다가왔다. ― 선수들이 경기장에 입장하고 있습니다! 오늘 이 두 팀 중 한 팀이 챔피언스리그 우승컵을 들게 됩니다! ― 긴장감이 흐르고 있습니다! 두 팀 모두 최고의 기세를 지닌 팀이고, 각자의 리그에서 우승을 한 팀들이기 때문에 승부를 예측하기가 어렵습니다! ― 양 팀의 스쿼드를 보겠습니다. 오늘 바이에른 뮌헨은 최근 레알 마드리드를 이겼던 전술을 그대로 들고나왔죠? ― 그렇습니다. 필립 람 선수와 바스티안 슈바인슈타이거 선수를 수비형 미드필더에 세우고, 양쪽 윙어 자리에 프랑크 리베리와 토마스 뮐러를, 공격형 미드필더 자리엔 이택현, 최전방 스트라이커 자리엔 신재욱 선수를 세웠습니다. 베스트 멤버죠. ― 레알 마드리드전을 생각해보면 이택현 선수와 신재욱 선수의 역할이 매우 중요할 것 같네요. ― 두 선수는 워낙 호흡이 좋은 선수들이니까요. 좋은 경기력을 보여줄 것 같습니다. 다음으로 아틀레티코 마드리드를 보시면 평소와 같이 4―4―2 포메이션을 들고나왔거든요? 그런데 평소랑은 조금 다른 게, 오늘의 아틀레티코 마드리드는 더 공격적으로 전술을 짜온 것 같습니다. 디에고 코스타 선수와 다비드 비야 선수를 투톱으로 세웠고, 아르다 투란, 가비, 코케 선수를 평소보다 더 앞쪽에 배치했거든요? 이건 디에고 시메오네 감독이 초반부터 바이에른 뮌헨을 강하게 몰아붙일 생각인 것 같습니다! ― 많은 수의 팬분들은 아틀레티코 마드리드가 수비적인 전술을 들고나올 거라고 예상했는데, 그 예상을 완전히 깨버린 디에고 시메오네 감독이네요! 이러면 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들도 당황할 수 있겠는데요? 해설들의 말처럼 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들은 당황하고 있었다. 아틀레티코 마드리드의 전술이 생각했던 것과는 달랐으니까. ‘디에고 시메오네 감독이 잘 준비했네.’ 신재욱도 작게 감탄했다. 모두의 예상을 깬 전술을 들고나온 디에고 시메오네 감독이 대단하게 느껴졌다. 하지만 거기까지였다. 위기를 느끼진 않았다. ‘선수들에게 익숙하지 않은 전술은 오히려 독이 될 수 있지.’ 리그 내내 사용하던 전술 말고 다른 전술을 사용하는 아틀레티코 마드리드가 강할 것 같지는 않았으니까. 오히려 기분이 좋아졌다. ‘금방 원래 전술로 돌아가게 해줘야겠어.’ 상대의 수비를 뚫는 게 예상보다 더 쉬워지겠다는 생각이 들었으니까. * * * 삐이이익! 바이에른 뮌헨과 아틀레티코 마드리드. 챔피언스리그 결승전에 오른 두 팀이 부딪쳤다. ― 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들이 적극적으로 공격을 시도하고 있습니다! 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들의 활동량이 평소보다 더 많은 것 같은데요? ― 정말 그렇네요. 아틀레티코 마드리드는 원래도 활동량이 많은 것으로 유명한 팀인데, 바이에른 뮌헨을 상대하는 오늘은 정말 많이 뛰네요! 아틀레티코 마드리드는 강한 체력을 바탕으로 경기장을 넓게 쓰며 공격을 만들어 나갔다. 빠른 템포를 유지하고 있음에도 라리가에서 우승한 팀답게 패스의 정확도가 높았고, 뒷공간을 노리는 스루패스도 날카로웠다. 하지만 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비도 단단했다. 상대가 예상과는 다른 전술을 들고나왔지만, 금방 침착함을 되찾곤 안정적으로 대응했다. ― 필립 람 선수! 중원에서 선수들을 진두지휘하며 안정감을 보여주고 있습니다! 역시 바이에른 뮌헨의 레전드답네요! 세계 최고의 측면 수비수에서 이제는 호셉 과르디올라 감독 체제에서 수비형 미드필더로도 완벽한 모습을 보여주고 있는 대단한 선수입니다. ― 필립 람 선수뿐만 아니라 바이에른 뮌헨 선수들의 집중력이 다 좋네요. 결승전이 치러질 때까지 푹 쉬다 와서 그런지 4강전 때보다 컨디션이 더 좋아 보입니다. ― 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수도 몸이 가벼워 보이죠? ― 그렇습니다. 특히 이택현 선수는 힘이 남아도는 것 같습니다. 과할 정도로 수비 가담을 해주고 있거든요? ― 하하하! 이택현 선수는 체력이 워낙 좋은 것으로 유명하니까요. 저렇게 뛰어도 풀타임을 무리 없이 소화하는 선수이지 않습니까. 필립 람과 슈바인슈타이거는 안정적인 수비를 보여주며 바이에른 뮌헨의 중심을 잡아줬고, 토마스 뮐러, 이택현, 프랑크 리베리가 수비에 가담하며 힘을 실어줬다. 아틀레티코 마드리드의 공격진을 이끄는 디에고 코스타, 다비드 비야, 아르다 투란, 가비, 코케는 그런 바이에른 뮌헨을 쉽게 공략하지 못했다. ― 필립 람이 끊어냅니다! 이야! 패스 경로를 완전히 읽었어요! 공을 끊어낸 필립 람은 곧바로 전진 패스를 뿌렸다. 패스에 자신이 있는 선수답게 과감한 시도였다. 투욱! 전방에 있던 이택현이 공을 받아냈다. 부드럽게 공을 받아낸 그는 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비수 미란다와의 몸싸움을 이겨내고 측면에서 달리는 토마스 뮐러에게 패스했다. ― 토마스 뮐러가 측면에서 공을 받습니다. 이택현 선수가 잘 연결해줬네요! 토마스 뮐러는 상대 수비수와의 일대일 상황에서 돌파를 시도하지 않았다. 그가 공을 끄는 사이에 측면으로 침투하던 하피냐에게 공을 넘겨줬다. ― 좋은 패스입니다! 하피냐 선수가 공을 잡습니다! 좋은 오버래핑으로 측면을 뚫어낸 하피냐는 곧바로 크로스까지 뿌려냈다. 퍼엉! 공이 휘어지며 아틀레티코 마드리드의 페널티박스 안으로 날아 들어왔다. 페널티박스 안에 있던 선수들이 다급히 몸을 띄웠다. 신재욱도 마찬가지였다. 어느새 가장 좋은 위치를 잡은 그는 공중에 몸을 띄운 채, 공에 집중했다. 상대 수비수의 방해가 있었지만, 강하게 뿌리쳐내며 날아오는 공에 머리를 가져다 댔다. 터엉! 이마와 공이 부딪쳤을 때 나는 타격음이 터졌다. 그러나 신재욱의 표정은 좋지 못했다. “아…….” 느낌으로 알았기 때문이었다. 빗맞았다는 것을. ― 아……! 이게 벗어나네요! 정말 아깝습니다! ― 신재욱 선수가 머리를 잘 가져다 댔는데, 살짝 빗맞았습니다. 신재욱 선수가 아쉬워하고 있네요. 비록 골이 터지진 않았지만. 아틀레티코 마드리드 선수들의 등줄기엔 식은땀이 흘렀다. 이들에겐 세계 최강의 수비력을 지닌 팀이라는 자부심이 있었기에, 단 한 번의 공격으로 실점을 할 뻔했다는 것에 깜짝 놀라고 있었다. ‘고딘을 상대로 공중볼을 따낸다고? 신재욱 저 자식, 엄청나잖아……?’ ‘역시 토마스 뮐러는 영리한 선수야. 침투하는 하피냐를 정확하게 보고 패스했어. 그리고 하피냐의 크로스도 꽤 날카로웠고.’ ‘바이에른 뮌헨의 공격이 생각보다 더 강한데……? 하마터면 경기 초반부터 골을 먹힐 뻔했어.’ ‘이미 알고 있었지만, 확실히 신재욱의 위치선정은 위협적이야. 더 집중해서 막지 않으면 큰일 나겠어.’ 첫 번째 슈팅 이후부터 바이에른 뮌헨이 기세를 잡아나갔다. 신재욱은 최전방에서 공을 잡을 때마다 안정적으로 지켜내며 동료에게 연결해줬고, 이택현은 번뜩이는 플레이로 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비진을 위협했다. 그리고 전반 19분이 되었을 때. 줄곧 안정적인 플레이를 하던 신재욱이 또다시 공을 받아냈다. 원래라면 수비수를 등진 채로 공을 받고, 측면으로 달리는 프랑크 리베리나 토마스 뮐러에게 패스를 줬을 것이다. 그게 아니면 다시 이택현에게 공을 넘기던가. 그런데 지금은 달랐다. 계속해서 비슷한 패턴으로 움직이던 신재욱이 갑자기 몸을 돌렸다. 당연히 신재욱이 공을 지킬 것이라고 예상했던 아틀레티코 마드리드의 중앙수비수 디에고 고딘은 깜짝 놀라며 팔을 뻗었다. 우선은 몸으로라도 신재욱의 움직임을 방해할 생각이었다. 그러나 신재욱은 디에고 고딘의 팔을 뿌리쳐내며 중심을 잡았다. 동시에 다리를 휘둘렀다. 기습적인 턴과 거의 같은 타이밍에 나온 슈팅. 그 예상치 못한 플레이에 아틀레티코 마드리드의 골키퍼 티보 쿠르투아는 미처 몸을 날리지 못했다. 깜짝 놀라며 몸을 움직이려고 했지만. 공은 이미 그의 몸을 지나 골대 안으로 파고들었다. 철썩! 골망이 크게 흔들릴 정도로 강력한 슈팅이었다. 그 순간 경기장에 커다란 함성이 터져 나왔다. ― 우오오오오! 들어갔습니드아아아아아! 고오오오오올! 신재욱입니다! 신재욱 선수가 엄청난 슈팅으로 세계 최강이라고 평가받는 아틀레티코 마드리드의 수비를 뚫어내고 골을 터트렸습니다! ― 이런 한 방이죠! 신재욱 선수에겐 이런 한 방이 있습니다! 정말 대단한 심리전이었습니다! 줄곧 수비수를 등지는 포스트 플레이만 하다가, 처음으로 기습적인 터닝슛을 시도한 것이거든요? 그런데 그게 골로 연결되네요! ― 디에고 고딘 선수를 완벽하게 속이고 만들어낸 골! 티보 쿠르투아 골키퍼도 반응하지 못했을 정도로 빠른 타이밍에 나온 슈팅이었습니다! 투웅! 퉁! 아틀레티코 마드리드의 골망을 경쾌하게 흔들던 공이 바닥에 튕겼다. 신재욱은 평소처럼 그 공을 옆구리에 낀 채, 경기장 중앙을 향해 뛰었다. 이때, 그의 눈엔 보였다. 특성이 성장했다는 메시지와 능력치가 올랐다는 메시지가. ‘챔피언스리그 결승전은 다를 것 같았어.’","output":"Before his reincarnation, Sin Jaewook was well aware of Atlético Madrid's style. It wasn't because he had a particular interest in Atlético Madrid. It was because Atlético Madrid's style was well-known. \\"Very defensive in style. But to call it simply defensive would be an understatement; it's well-organized, and the counterattacks are quite sharp.\\" A style known for its focus on defense, with players forming two defensive lines. Of course, weaknesses and limitations of this tactic would be discovered later on. But at this point in time, Diego Simeone's Atlético Madrid was considered to have the world's best defense. Their performance was also impressive. \\"They're this season's La Liga champions.\\" La Liga champions of the 2013/14 season! That was the achievement of Atlético Madrid. Thus, this Champions League final was also a clash between the Bundesliga champions and the La Liga champions. Naturally, this match became a hot topic among football fans. └ The La Liga champions are meeting the Bundesliga champions. Can we say these are the best teams right now? └ Right. This season, Simeone's Atlético Madrid is the strongest in La Liga, and Guardiola's Bayern Munich is the strongest in the Bundesliga. └ I'm really looking forward to this match. A battle between the strongest teams of La Liga and the Bundesliga! └ I think Bayern Munich will win. They even beat Real Madrid in the semifinals. └ Atlético Madrid also beat Real Madrid in the league. └ I think Atlético Madrid will win. Their defense is like a fortress. It feels like they won't be breached. └ Bayern Munich's attack is one of the best in the world, but they will struggle against Atlético Madrid's defensive tactics. └ Sin Jaewook will definitely score, right? Especially if he's playing with Lee Taekhyun? Then it's 100%. The synergy between Sin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun is the best in the world. └ Atlético Madrid is also a very strong team, so I can't tell who will win this final. They're not just any team; they beat Chelsea to get here, and quite convincingly. └ The second leg against Chelsea was no joke. It showed that Atlético Madrid also has a strong attack. Perhaps due to the fans' interest and anticipation? The day of the final arrived quickly. ― The players are entering the stadium! Today, one of these two teams will lift the Champions League trophy! ― There's tension in the air! Both teams are at their peak, and since they both won their respective leagues, it's hard to predict the outcome! ― Let's look at the squads. Today, Bayern Munich has brought the same tactics that won them the match against Real Madrid, right? ― Yes. They've placed Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger as defensive midfielders, with Franck Ribéry and Thomas Müller on the wings, Lee Taekhyun as the attacking midfielder, and Sin Jaewook as the striker. It's their best lineup. ― Considering the match against Real Madrid, the roles of Lee Taekhyun and Sin Jaewook seem very important. ― Since both players have great synergy, they're expected to perform well. Now, looking at Atlético Madrid, they've come out with their usual 4-4-2 formation, right? But there's a slight difference today; Atlético Madrid seems to have come with a more offensive tactic. They've placed Diego Costa and David Villa as the top two strikers, and Arda Turan, Gabi, and Koke are positioned further forward than usual. It seems like Diego Simeone plans to press Bayern Munich hard from the start! ― Many fans expected Atlético Madrid to come out with a defensive tactic, but Diego Simeone has completely shattered that expectation! This might catch the Bayern Munich players off guard, right? As the commentators mentioned, the Bayern Munich players were indeed taken aback. Atlético Madrid's tactics were different from what they had anticipated. \\"Diego Simeone has prepared well.\\" Sin Jaewook also admired quietly. He was impressed by Diego Simeone, who had brought unexpected tactics that defied everyone's predictions. But that was it. He didn't feel a crisis. \\"An unfamiliar tactic to the players could actually be a poison.\\" He didn't think that Atlético Madrid, using a different tactic than what they had been using all season, would be strong. Instead, he felt better. \\"I'll have to make them revert to their original tactics soon.\\" Because he thought that breaking through the opponent's defense would be easier than expected. *** Whistle! Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid. The two teams that reached the Champions League final clashed. ― Atlético Madrid players are actively attempting to attack! It seems like they're moving more than usual, right? ― Indeed. Atlético Madrid is already known for their high work rate, but today against Bayern Munich, they're really running a lot! Atlético Madrid built their attacks using their strong stamina, spreading the play across the field. Despite maintaining a fast tempo, they showed the accuracy of a La Liga-winning team with their passes, and their through passes targeting the back space were sharp. But Bayern Munich's defense was solid. Even though the opponent came out with an unexpected tactic, they quickly regained their composure and responded steadily. ― Philipp Lahm! He's commanding the players in the midfield and showing stability! Truly worthy of being a Bayern Munich legend! One of the world's best full-backs, now showing a perfect performance as a defensive midfielder under Josep Guardiola's system. ― Not just Philipp Lahm, but all Bayern Munich players are focused. They seem to be in better condition than during the semifinals, maybe because they rested well before the final. ― Sin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun also look light on their feet, right? ― Yes. Especially Lee Taekhyun, he seems to have energy to spare. He's even helping out with the defense excessively? ― Haha! Lee Taekhyun is famous for his stamina. He can run like that and still play the full match without any trouble. Philipp Lahm and Schweinsteiger provided stable defense, anchoring Bayern Munich, while Thomas Müller, Lee Taekhyun, and Franck Ribéry joined the defense, lending their strength. Atlético Madrid's attackers, led by Diego Costa, David Villa, Arda Turan, Gabi, and Koke, couldn't easily penetrate Bayern Munich. ― Philipp Lahm intercepts! Wow! He completely read the pass route! After intercepting the ball, Philipp Lahm immediately sent a forward pass. True to his confidence in passing, it was a bold attempt. Thwack! Lee Taekhyun, who was up front, received the ball. He smoothly controlled the ball, overcame the physical challenge from Atlético Madrid's defender Miranda, and passed to Thomas Müller, who was running down the flank. ― Thomas Müller receives the ball on the flank. Lee Taekhyun connected it well! Thomas Müller didn't attempt to break through in the one-on-one situation with the opposing defender. While he was drawing the ball, he passed it to Rafinha, who was infiltrating the flank. ― Good pass! Rafinha gets the ball! Rafinha, who broke through the flank with a good overlapping run, immediately delivered a cross. Boom! The ball curved into Atlético Madrid's penalty box. The players inside the box hurriedly leaped into the air. Sin Jaewook did the same. Having secured the best position, he focused on the ball while airborne. Despite the opposition from the defending player, he forcefully shook him off and headed the incoming ball. Thud! The sound of the impact between his forehead and the ball echoed. However, Sin Jaewook's expression was not good. \\"Ah...\\" He knew by the feel. That he had misjudged it. ― Ah...! It's gone wide! That was really close! ― Sin Jaewook headed the ball well, but it was slightly off. Sin Jaewook looks disappointed. Although a goal didn't result from it. Sweat ran down the backs of Atlético Madrid's players. They had pride in being a team with the world's strongest defense, so they were shocked that they nearly conceded a goal from just one attack. 'Winning an aerial ball against Godín? That Sin Jaewook guy, he's incredible...?' 'Thomas Müller is indeed a clever player. He accurately saw Rafinha infiltrating and passed the ball. And Rafinha's cross was quite sharp too.' 'The attack from Bayern Munich is stronger than I thought...? We almost conceded a goal right at the start of the game.' 'I already knew, but Sin Jaewook's positioning is definitely threatening. We need to focus more to stop him, or we'll be in big trouble.' From the first shot onwards, Bayern Munich began to take control of the game. Sin Jaewook, at the forefront, consistently protected the ball and connected it to his teammates, while Lee Taekhyun threatened Atlético Madrid's defense with his dazzling play. And then, at the 19th minute of the first half. Sin Jaewook, who had been playing steadily, received the ball again. Normally, he would have received the ball with his back to the defenders and passed it to Franck Ribéry or Thomas Müller running on the flanks. Or he would have passed it back to Lee Taekhyun. But this time was different. Sin Jaewook, who had been moving in a similar pattern, suddenly turned around. Atlético Madrid's central defender Diego Godín, who had expected Sin Jaewook to protect the ball, was taken aback and stretched out his arm. His first thought was to at least hinder Sin Jaewook's movement with his body. However, Sin Jaewook shook off Diego Godín's arm and stabilized his center. At the same time, he swung his leg. A surprise turn and a shot that came out almost simultaneously. Caught off guard by that unexpected play, Atlético Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois couldn't throw himself in time. Startled, he tried to move his body. But the ball had already passed him and burrowed into the goal. Slap! It was a powerful shot that made the goal net shake greatly. At that moment, a huge cheer erupted in the stadium. ― Wooow! It's in! Goooooal! Sin Jaewook! Sin Jaewook scores with an incredible shot, breaking through the defense of Atlético Madrid, which is considered the strongest in the world! ― That's the kind of shot! Sin Jaewook has that kind of shot! It was a really great psychological play! For the first time, he attempted a surprise turning shot instead of just playing as a post player with his back to the defenders, and it led to a goal! ― A goal that completely deceived Diego Godín! It was a shot that came out so quickly that goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois couldn't even react! Thwump! Thud! The ball that delightfully shook Atlético Madrid's goal net bounced on the ground. Sin Jaewook, as usual, tucked the ball under his arm and ran towards the center of the pitch. At that moment, he saw it. Messages indicating that his attributes had grown and his stats had increased. 'I thought the Champions League final would be different.'"},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello! It looks like your message may not have come through completely. How can I assist you today?

Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials. Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot: 1. **Check the prerequisites:** Ensure that all the required libraries and tools for QE are correctly installed. This can include MPI (for parallel execution), BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, and any other library that QE depends on. 2. **Review output logs:** Look for detailed error logs in the \`test-suite\` directory or in the individual test directories listed in the error message. These logs might provide clues as to why each test is failing. 3. **Environment Setup:** Make sure that your environment variables are set correctly. For instance, the \`PATH\` should include the locations of the QE executables, and \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` should include any libraries QE needs at runtime. 4. **Compiler and Flags:** Check if QE was compiled with the correct compilers and flags. Misconfiguration here might cause the compiled programs to fail during execution. 5. **Resource Allocation:** If you're running the tests on a system with limited resources, make sure you are not exceeding memory or CPU limits. 6. **Version Compatibility:** Double-check if the version of QE you are testing is compatible with your hardware and software environment. Sometimes, newer or older versions may have issues with certain platforms. 7. **Check for Known Issues:** Visit the QE forums, mailing lists, or websites to check if there are any known bugs or issues with the version you are using that might affect the test suite. 8. **Sequential vs Parallel:** If you are running the test suite in parallel, try running a single test in sequential mode to see if parallelization is the issue. 9. **Filesystem and Permissions:** Make sure that the filesystem you are using (here it looks like Windows Subsystem for Linux, given the \`/mnt/c/Users/...\` path) does not have any issues with permissions or other restrictions that might prevent QE from running correctly. 10. **Contact Developers:** If all else fails, consider contacting the developers of Quantum ESPRESSO or posting on relevant user forums with detailed information about the failure, including any error logs you have. Isolating the issue could take some time, considering that there are multiple failed tests. You would typically start by examining one failure and working through it to see if there's a common factor causing all the tests to fail."},{"instruction":"BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW how do i check if they are there in ubuntu","output":"In Ubuntu, you can check for the presence of BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW libraries, and install them if they are missing, using the following steps: 1. **Check Installed Packages:** Open a terminal and use the \`dpkg\` command to check if the libraries are already installed: \`\`\`bash dpkg -l | grep \\"libblas\\" dpkg -l | grep \\"liblapack\\" dpkg -l | grep \\"libfftw3\\" \`\`\` These commands will list any installed packages that contain \\"libblas\\", \\"liblapack\\", or \\"libfftw3\\" in their names. If you see the libraries listed with \`ii\` at the beginning of the line, they are installed. For instance, \`ii libblas-dev\` indicates that the BLAS development package is installed. 2. **Install Missing Packages:** If you find that the desired libraries are not installed, you can install them using \`apt-get\`. You might want the development versions (\`-dev\`) of these packages if you need to compile software that depends on them: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev \`\`\` These commands will install the development versions of the BLAS and LAPACK linear algebra libraries, and the FFTW library used for computing Fourier transforms. 3. **Verify Library Installation:** After installation, rerun the \`dpkg -l | grep ...\` commands to verify that the libraries are now installed. 4. **Additional Libraries:** Quantum ESPRESSO might also require the Scalapack and OpenMPI libraries. You can check and install those as follows: \`\`\`bash dpkg -l | grep \\"libscalapack\\" dpkg -l | grep \\"openmpi\\" # If missing, install them sudo apt-get install libscalapack-openmpi-dev openmpi-bin \`\`\` Please note that some versions of the BLAS and LAPACK libraries might be optimized for specific architectures.

The \`make.sys\` or equivalent configuration file for your Quantum ESPRESSO build should have the correct paths and library link flags. 2. **Check Versions:** Sometimes specific software may require certain versions of libraries. You should check Quantum ESPRESSO's documentation to see if it specifies which versions of BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW it is compatible with. 3. **Run a Simple Test:** Some software packages come with simple test programs to check that the libraries are working as expected. If Quantum ESPRESSO provides these, it can be useful to compile and run them to confirm the libraries are functional. 4. **Confirm Library Path:** You might want to ensure that the library path to BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW is correctly recognized by your system. You can set the \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` environment variable for dynamic linking: \`\`\`bash export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/:LD_LIBRARY_PATH \`\`\` Adjust the path \`/usr/lib/\` if the libraries are located in a different directory. 5. **Recompile Quantum ESPRESSO:** If unsure whether the libraries are correctly used, reconfigure and rebuild Quantum ESPRESSO. Remember to clean any previous builds before recompiling to avoid conflicts: \`\`\`bash make clean all ./configure make all \`\`\` Replace \`./configure\` with the actual configuration command you use, which might include specifying compilers or library paths. 6. **Check for Additional Dependencies:** Quantum ESPRESSO may require other dependencies or have certain requirements for the compiler and its flags. Read the documentation that came with Quantum ESPRESSO for any special instructions. If after checking all these aspects Quantum ESPRESSO still fails to pass the tests, consider reaching out to the Quantum ESPRESSO community or user forums for support.

Here's what you can do: 1. **Fortran Compiler Flags:** Examine the compiler flags being used. You may need to adjust them to either suppress this kind of warning or to enforce more compatible type checking. For instance, you might be using \`gfortran\` with flags like \`-Wall\`, which enables all warnings — you can remove that or use \`-w\` to suppress all warnings (although this isn't generally recommended because it can hide legitimate issues). Please be cautious when suppressing warnings; it's better to understand and address them when possible. To adjust the compiler flags, find where they are defined, often in a \`make.inc\` or \`make.sys\` file or environment variables set before running \`make\`. 2. **Compiler Version:** It's possible that the version of the Fortran compiler you are using is either too new or too old for the Quantum ESPRESSO version you're trying to compile. Check the Quantum ESPRESSO documentation for recommended compiler versions. Sometimes, using a different version of the same compiler or a different Fortran compiler altogether, such as \`ifort\` (Intel Fortran) instead of \`gfortran\`, might resolve the issue. 3. **Code Inspection:** Look into the source file \`ptoolkit.f90\` around line 5734 to better understand the context of the error. There might be an explicit type cast required or some mismatch in function/subroutine argument types. You might need to insert a typecasting function like \`real()\` or \`dble()\` to match the expected argument type. 4. **Seek Assistance:** If you are not comfortable modifying the source code or if the warning persists and you cannot determine how to fix it, consider asking for help from the Quantum ESPRESSO user community. It is likely that others may have encountered and solved the same issue. 5. **Update/Revert Quantum ESPRESSO:** If you are not running the latest stable release of Quantum ESPRESSO, consider updating to it. Conversely, if you're using a version that was released very recently, there might still be bugs that need to be ironed out, and you may want to revert to an earlier, more stable release. Remember that while warnings do not generally stop the compilation or operation of a program, they can sometimes indicate potential issues that might affect the results or performance of your calculations. Therefore, aim to resolve them where feasible rather than ignoring them."},{"instruction":"ok so its something to do with fortran . i read this which might give us a plan to try : Quantum Espresso is built using the GNU build system , so the source program distribution contains a script called 'configure'. It attempts to detect which compilers you have installed, by using them to compile and run tiny test programs before you try to build QE itself. This script stops with the message configure: error: Fortran compiler cannot create executables if you don't have any usable Fortran compiler installed, 'configure' runs in an environment where the Fortran compiler doesn't work correctly, or your Fortran compiler was installed in an unusual place, so that automatic detection fails. Case 1 is fixed by obtaining a Fortran compiler. gfortran will work, or if you want to spend money on a fancier one, ifort does the job. You should also be able to use PGI Fortran, but I haven't tried that myself. Case 2 is a somewhat unlikely one, but it can happen if you have, say, a compiler that dynamically links the resulting binary to a run-time library stored in a different location than the common system defaults. If this should happen, you will need to adjust the contents of the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that the program loader can find the relevant library. You can test it in your environment without running 'configure', by trying to compile and run a simple Fortran program yourself - here's a minimal 'Hello, world' code you can test, if you're not comfortable with writing your own: PROGRAM hello PRINT *,\\"Hello, world!\\" END PROGRAM Case 3 is remedied by explicitly naming the compilers and setup you wish to use in the environment variables FC (Fortran compiler), FCFLAGS (Fortran compiler flags), F77 (FORTRAN77 compiler, if different from the FC choice), and FFLAGS (FORTRAN77 compiler flags). The contents of these variables are what 'configure' tries to figure out automatically, but if you set them manually, it will use your choices instead of trying to detect anything of its own invention. None of the above is different from how automake-generated 'configure' scripts behave with other program sources than Quantum Espresso, but I suppose it might stand out a little because of containing large sections of Fortran code, and thus requiring a compiler you otherwise may not use very often. Since the question doesn't say which version of QE to build, it is also possible that something completely different could be the matter, but I can verify that neither Quantum Espresso 4.3 nor 5.1.1 require anything beyond what's above, at least as far as Fortran compilers go. You might also want to build it with support for various external libraries, so I'd suggest that you consult the output of ./configure --help, to review all your options.","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems that you're aware of the build system used by Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) and that the \`configure\` script is involved in setting up the compilation environment before building the code. Here are the steps you can follow to ensure your Fortran compiler setup is correct and that QE can be compiled: 1. **Check for Fortran Compiler:** Verify that a Fortran compiler is installed on your system. \`gfortran\` is commonly used and can be installed via: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get install gfortran \`\`\` 2. **Test Fortran Compiler:** Save the 'Hello, World' program provided in your message to a file (e.g. \`hello.f90\`) and try to compile it with your Fortran compiler: \`\`\`bash gfortran hello.f90 -o hello ./hello \`\`\` If this works and prints \\"Hello, world!\\" without errors, your Fortran compiler is functioning correctly. 3. **Set Environment Variables:** If your Fortran compiler is installed in an unconventional location, you may need to set the \`FC\` environment variable to point to it. Optionally, you can use \`FCFLAGS\` for compiler flags: \`\`\`bash export FC=/path/to/gfortran export FCFLAGS=-O3 \`\`\` Adjust the path and flags as necessary. Similarly, set \`F77\` and \`FFLAGS\` if your FORTRAN 77 compiler is different or requires different flags. 4. **Run the Configure Script:** From within the top directory of the QE source code (where the \`configure\` script is located), run: \`\`\`bash ./configure \`\`\` This will attempt to automatically determine compiler settings. Check the output carefully for any errors or warnings. 5. **Consult Configure Help:** Run \`./configure --help\` to see all configuration options available. This can be helpful if you want to specify particular libraries or options for the build process. 6. **Build QE:** After successfully running \`configure\`, compile QE: \`\`\`bash make all \`\`\` Monitor the output for any errors that may indicate problems during compilation. If you encounter errors where the \`configure\` script is unable to create executables with the Fortran compiler, then you would need to look into the specific messages provided. They might suggest issues with library paths (requiring adjustments to \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`), or they might indicate incorrect paths to the compiler itself or necessary flags (requiring setting \`FC\`, \`FCFLAGS\`, etc.). Remember, the \`configure\` script logs will often hint at what went wrong, so carefully examine its output when troubleshooting issues. If you encounter persistent problems, consider sharing the specific error messages or seeking help from the QE user community, as they may have direct experience with similar issues."},{"instruction":"Test Fortran Compiler lets do that , guide me please , remember its for ubuntu","output":"Certainly! To test the Fortran compiler (typically \`gfortran\` on Ubuntu), you can write a simple Fortran program and try to compile it. Here's how you can do it step by step: 1. **Open a Terminal:** Press \`Ctrl\` + \`Alt\` + \`T\` or search for \\"Terminal\\" in your applications menu to open a terminal window. 2. **Write a Simple Fortran Program:** Using a text editor, such as \`nano\`, create a simple Fortran program called \`hello.f90\`. You can do this by typing the following command in the terminal: \`\`\`bash nano hello.f90 \`\`\` Then, type in the following Fortran code: \`\`\`fortran PROGRAM hello PRINT *, \\"Hello, world!\\" END PROGRAM hello \`\`\` Save the file and exit the editor by pressing \`Ctrl\` + \`X\`, then \`Y\` for yes to save changes, and finally \`Enter\` to confirm the filename. 3. **Compile the Program with gfortran:** Now, compile the program using \`gfortran\`: \`\`\`bash gfortran hello.f90 -o hello \`\`\` This command tells \`gfortran\` to compile the file \`hello.f90\`, and \`-o hello\` specifies the output executable file name, which will be \`hello\`. 4. **Run the Compiled Program:** To run your newly compiled Fortran program, simply type: \`\`\`bash ./hello \`\`\` You should see the output \\"Hello, world!\\" printed to the terminal if everything is working correctly. Now, if any of these steps fail, it will give you an indication of what might be wrong.

You can list the files in the directory with: \`\`\`bash ls -l \`\`\` This will display all files in the current directory, and you should look for \`hello.f90\` in this list. 2. **Check File Permissions:** If the file does exist, check that you have the necessary permissions to read it. When you list the files with \`ls -l\`, check the permissions in the left-most column (you're looking for 'r' which stands for read permission). 3. **Check File Name:** Double-check the file name and spelling. Ensure there are no hidden characters, additional extensions, or typos in the file name. Linux is case-sensitive, so \`hello.f90\` is different from \`Hello.F90\`. 4. **Check for Hidden Characters:** If you created the \`hello.f90\` file using a Windows text editor, there might be hidden carriage return (\`r\`) characters, which can cause issues. You can use \`dos2unix\` to convert the file to Unix format if this is the case. If you don't have \`dos2unix\` installed, you can install it with: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get install dos2unix dos2unix hello.f90 \`\`\` 5. **Create the File Again:** If the file is not present or you keep having issues, you might want to create it again. Use \`nano hello.f90\` to recreate the file, or use another method to ensure it's in the correct directory without any hidden characters. 6. **Filesystem Sync Issues in WSL:** If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), there could be synchronizing issues between the Windows and Linux filesystems. Make sure you created or copied the file into the Lumia 900 directory from within WSL, not from Windows.

The \`configure\` script first looked for the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), which is a highly optimized set of mathematical routines for science, engineering, and financial applications, but didn't find it in the specified paths. It then continued to look for a generic BLAS library but still could not find one. Here's what you should do to resolve this issue: 1. **Install Generic BLAS and LAPACK libraries:** If you have not installed the generic BLAS and LAPACK or their development packages, you should install them. On Ubuntu, you can install these using the following commands: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev \`\`\` This will install the BLAS and LAPACK development libraries which are necessary for compilation. 2. **Retry \`configure\`:** After installing, run the \`configure\` script again: \`\`\`bash ./configure \`\`\` The script should now be able to find the generic BLAS and LAPACK libraries. 3. **Specifying Library Locations Manually:** If, for some reason, the \`configure\` script still cannot find these libraries, you may need to manually specify the location of the libraries using \`--with-blas=\` and \`--with-lapack=\` options when you run \`configure\`. The exact path where these libraries are installed may vary depending on your system. Example: \`\`\`bash ./configure --with-blas=\\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libblas.so\\" --with-lapack=\\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblapack.so\\" \`\`\` These options tell the \`configure\` script explicitly where to find BLAS and LAPACK. If you’ve installed Intel MKL and want to use it instead of the generic BLAS and LAPACK, you would need to locate the Intel MKL libraries on your system and use similar \`--with-blas=\` and \`--with-lapack=\` options to specify their locations. It's worth noting that while Intel MKL provides highly optimized routines, it's not free software, and you would generally have to install it separately from the Intel software suite. The generic BLAS and LAPACK libraries are open-source and free to use. After ensuring that \`configure\` can find the BLAS and LAPACK libraries, the configuration process should continue without the \`dgemm\`-related errors.

Here's a brief explanation of both warnings: 1. **Missing Argument:** The first warning is about a missing actual argument for a dummy variable in a procedure call. This may be due to an oversight in the code or a change in an API where an additional argument is now expected. However, if the code is unmodified and part of a well-tested library like Quantum ESPRESSO, it's possible that this warning is non-critical or expected due to variations in argument handling across different Fortran compilers. 2. **Type Mismatch:** The second warning suggests that there is a type mismatch between actual arguments provided to a procedure call. In this case, it's between a \`REAL(8)\` (double precision real number) and \`COMPLEX(8)\` (double precision complex number). This could potentially be a more significant issue as it implies differing mathematical operations might be performed than expected. The compilation flags being used (\`-O3 -g -fallow-argument-mismatch\`) include an allowance for argument mismatches, which suggests that these warnings might be somewhat anticipated. Specifically, \`-fallow-argument-mismatch\` tells the compiler to permit argument mismatches for procedures with explicit interfaces. **What to Do:** - **Inspect the Warnings:** Since these are warnings, they may not necessarily stop the program from functioning, especially if they are known and expected by the developers. That said, it's important to make sure these aren't indicative of underlying issues that could lead to incorrect results. - **Consult Quantum ESPRESSO:** If these warnings are numerous and you do not have the expertise to assess whether they are benign or significant, consider reaching out to the Quantum ESPRESSO community, providing the full output, and asking for clarification. - **Proceed with Caution:** If the compilation process completes successfully and a test suite is available (as it often is with scientific software), running the test suite can help assure that the compiled software is functioning correctly, despite the warnings. - **Compiler Version or Flags:** If these warnings are problematic, consider switching to a different version of \`gfortran\` or using different compiler flags that enforce stricter type-checking. This requires a careful approach to ensure compatibility with the rest of the system and the QE software. If the compilation completely fails due to errors (not just warnings), that will necessitate more direct intervention, potentially involving modifications to the source code or its configuration."},{"instruction":"ohh my god , im doing the cd test-suite ...make run-tests... and its passing every one so far ,, i can't believe it ,, so it was that issue we fixed eariler , ohhh woweeeeeee","output":"That's fantastic news! I'm really glad to hear that your Quantum ESPRESSO tests are passing. It seems like the earlier steps to ensure your system's environment was correctly set up paid off. Scientific software like Quantum ESPRESSO can be particularly sensitive to the configuration of the build environment, so resolving those initial issues can make a big difference. While compiler warnings can sometimes be confusing or concerning, if the tests are running and passing, it's a good sign that the software has been compiled correctly and should be functional for your simulations or calculations. Make sure to let all the tests complete, and then you can start using Quantum ESPRESSO for your research or projects with confidence.

The failures could be due to a variety of factors, such as minute numerical discrepancies, system-specific quirks, or occasionally more substantive issues. Once you have the full list of passed and failed tests, you can take the following steps: 1. **Review the Logs:** Each failed test should produce a log file or output that details the nature of the failure. Review these logs to understand what went wrong. 2. **Verify Tolerances:** Sometimes, the difference between the expected and actual results is within an acceptable range of numerical tolerance, but the test is configured to fail if there's any discrepancy. Check if this is the case. 3. **System-Specific Differences:** Different hardware, compilers, and libraries can all lead to slight variations in results. Failures might be expected on certain systems and do not necessarily indicate a problem. 4. **Seek Guidance:** Quantum ESPRESSO's community forums, mailing lists, or the user guide may have information on common test failures and their significance. 5. **Isolate Failures:** If only a couple of tests out of an extensive suite are failing, and there's no indication that these failures are critical, it's usually safe to proceed, particularly if the failed tests are not related to the features you plan to use. 6. **Report Issues:** If you suspect a bug or an issue that might affect others, consider reporting it to the Quantum ESPRESSO developers with detailed information about your system and the failures. 7. **Re-Run Failed Tests:** In some cases, running the failed tests individually can help isolate the issue, as this may remove any side-effects from other tests.

The specific failures are associated with missing data in the test output that is present in the benchmark output. This could mean that the calculation didn't produce some expected results, or that the results differ in a way that isn't captured by the test comparison scripts. Here's what you can do to address these failed tests: 1. **Investigate the Log Files:** Detailed log files for these tests should be available in the test directories or as part of the test output. They will contain information on the run itself and any errors or warnings that appeared during the calculation. 2. **Benchmark Comparison:** Some tests compare the execution output to a pre-existing benchmark. If a simulation doesn't produce output that exactly matches the benchmark, the test will fail. Analyze whether the differences are significant or within acceptable tolerances. 3. **Check for Known Issues:** Sometimes, test failures can be attributed to known issues with the software or the tests themselves. Check Quantum ESPRESSO's documentation, forums, or issue trackers for any notes on these tests. 4. **Run Failed Tests Manually:** To get a better understanding of what's gone wrong, you can run the failed tests manually by executing the commands used in the tests in their respective directories. 5. **Hardware and Compiler Considerations:** If you're using different hardware or compilers than those used to produce the benchmarks, you may get slight variations in the output. Ensure that your system's numerical precision and performance characteristics are considered when assessing test failures. 6. **Environment Settings:** Make sure your computational environment (such as MPI settings, stack size, etc.) is correctly configured, as misconfiguration can sometimes cause tests to fail. 7. **Examine Updates or Patches:** If you're using a newer or patched version of Quantum ESPRESSO, ensure these modifications have been taken into account for the tests. Before drawing conclusions about the reliability of your QE installation based on these two tests, assess the nature of the discrepancies. If they are minor and your use case for QE doesn't rely on the precise aspects of the program being tested, it might be reasonable to proceed with your work while being aware of these differences. If after investigating, the cause of the test failures is still unclear or seems critical to your work, reaching out to the Quantum ESPRESSO community, as suggested earlier, could provide additional insight or assistance. If you received any additional messages or need help interpreting the logs or test results, please share the details and I'll do my best to provide guidance."},{"instruction":"well i checked the logs and its huge complex files with tons of data , its hard to know where to even begin with that lot , its many many pages of text , nothing of it means anyting much to me either lol","output":"Interpreting logs from complex scientific software like Quantum ESPRESSO can indeed be daunting, especially if you are not familiar with the specifics of the software's operations and the details of the simulations being run. However, since the rest of the tests passed and only two failed, there's a good chance that your Quantum ESPRESSO installation is generally sound. Here are a few strategies to handle the failed test logs: 1. **Search for Errors:** Open the log file and search for keywords like \\"Error\\", \\"Fatal\\", \\"Failed\\", or \\"Cannot\\". This can often lead you directly to the critical part of the log file. 2. **Look at the End:** Often, summary information about what went wrong is located toward the end of the log file, so skim the final few pages for any indications. 3. **Compare Files:** Attempt to find the differences between the test output and the benchmark (reference) output. Tools like \`diff\` or graphical comparison tools may help you visualize these differences more readily. 4. **Focus on Specific Data:** The error messages you posted indicate specific data points (\`geom\`, \`ef1\`, \`n1\`, \`e1\`) that are in the benchmark but not in your test output. You can look specifically for these in the log files to understand why they weren't generated or are different. 5. **Ask for Assistance:** The Quantum ESPRESSO community is often very helpful. You could post on forums, mailing lists, or wherever the Quantum ESPRESSO community gathers, including the key error messages from the log files and asking for guidance on how to interpret them. 6. **Contextual Understanding:** If these failed tests relate to features or functionality of Quantum ESPRESSO that you don't plan to use, they may not be relevant to your work. Remember, the purpose of running the test suite is to verify that the software performs correctly for the kinds of calculations you intend to do. If the features related to the failed tests are not crucial for your research or the discrepancies are minor, you may decide to proceed while taking note of these issues. However, if you require absolute correctness or are working in a field where the exact details of those tests are critical, further investigation is warranted. Ultimately, given the complexity of the software, seeking support from colleagues who are experienced with Quantum ESPRESSO or directly reaching out to the QE user community might be the most effective way to understand the significance of these test failures."},{"instruction":"well what i'd like to do next is use it as intended but with something super simple just to get a taste of what it does and how to use it , can you help me with that pls","output":"Certainly! A great way to get started with Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) is to run a simple calculation, such as a ground-state energy computation for a single atom or a simple crystal structure. Here's a basic guide on performing a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation for a silicon (Si) crystal using QE. Silicon is a good example because it has a straightforward diamond structure and is well-documented. 1. **Create an Input File:** You'll need to create an input file for PWscf (\`pw.x\`), the plane-wave self-consistent field program of QE. We'll call this file \`si.scf.in\`. Here is a simplified input file that you can use: \`\`\`plaintext &CONTROL calculation = 'scf', prefix = 'silicon', pseudo_dir = '/path/to/pseudopotentials/', outdir = './out', / &SYSTEM ibrav = 2, celldm(1) = 10.26, nat = 2, ntyp = 1, ecutwfc = 12.0, occupations = 'smearing', smearing = 'gauss', degauss = 0.01, / &ELECTRONS mixing_beta = 0.7, / ATOMIC_SPECIES Si 28.0855 Si.pz-vbc.UPF ATOMIC_POSITIONS {crystal} Si 0.00 0.00 0.00 Si 0.25 0.25 0.25 K_POINTS {automatic} 4 4 4 1 1 1 \`\`\` This example assumes you have a pseudopotential file named \`Si.pz-vbc.UPF\` in your pseudo directory. Change \`/path/to/pseudopotentials/\` to the actual path where you have the pseudopotential file stored. 2. **Prepare Directories and Files:** - Create a directory for your QE calculations and a subdirectory named \`out\` (as specified by the \`outdir\` control parameter) to store output files. - Ensure the pseudopotential file for silicon (\`Si.pz-vbc.UPF\`) is in the specified directory. 3. **Run QE:** Load QE modules if needed (depends on your installation) and run the calculation with the following command from the directory where your input file is located: \`\`\`bash pw.x < si.scf.in > si.scf.out \`\`\` 4. **Examine the Output:** After the calculation finishes, you will have an output file called \`si.scf.out\`. This file contains a lot of information including the starting parameters, convergence information, the final computed total energy, and more. 5. **Interpret Results:** Look for the total energy of the system reported in the output file, check for convergence messages, and verify that there were no errors during the run. This is the most basic type of calculation you can run on QE and should give you an idea of how to work with the software. As you get more familiar with QE, you can start exploring more complex systems, different types of calculations (geometry optimization, density of states, molecular dynamics, etc.), and playing with the various input parameters to see how they affect the results. The [Quantum ESPRESSO User's Guide](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/resources/users-manual) is an excellent reference for diving deeper into the capabilities of the software. Please ensure to replace the path to the pseudopotential and the name of the pseudopotential file with the appropriate ones you have.

Verify that there are no such restrictions, or try running the calculation outside of WSL to see if the problem persists. 5. **Consult QE Output/Error Files:** When MPI invokes an abort, it usually generates some output or error files with additional details on what went wrong. Look for \`.out\` and \`.err\` files in the working directory and examine them for clues. 6. **Resource Limits:** Ensure that there are no system resource limits being hit (such as memory limits). You can check the current limits with \`ulimit -a\`. 7. **Recompile QE (if necessary):** If none of the above steps work, there might be a problem with the Quantum ESPRESSO binaries. You may need to recompile QE, ensuring that all necessary MPI libraries are accessible and correctly linked during the build process.

\`<ul>\` نیست. 2. افزایش قابلیت خوانایی کد: استفاده از indentation و ترتیب مناسب برای کدها. 3. افزودن پسوندهای فایل های تصویری (مانند \`.jpg\` یا \`.png\`) به جای \`...\` در تگ های \`<img src=\\"...\\">\`. در اینجا یک نسخه اصلاح شده از کد HTML شما به همراه CSS زیبای ارائه شده است: \`\`\`html {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block body %} <div class=\\"container\\"> <h1

template.Library() @register.filter def discounted_price(price, discount): return price - (price * discount / 100) \`\`\` بعد از ایجاد این فیلتر سفارشی، آن را در قالب HTML خود با اضافه کردن \`{% load

فیلتر سفارشی که شما سعی در استفاده از آن دارید، به درستی در دسترس قالب قرار نگرفته است یا اشتباه نوشته شده است. برای اینکه فیلتر \`discounted_price\` به درستی کار کند، باید مراحل زیر را به دقت انجام دهید: # گام ۱: ایجاد فیلتر سفارشی ابتدا یک فیلتر جدید ایجاد کرده‌اید. برای مثال، داخل اپلیکیشن Django خود، پوشه‌ای به نام \`templatetags\` ایجاد کنید (اگر هنوز وجود ندارد). داخل پوشه \`templatetags\` یک فایل پایتون با نام دلخواه (مثلا \`discount_filters.py\`) ایجاد کنید و کد زیر را در آن قرار دهید: \`\`\`python # templatetags/discount_filters.py from django import template register = template.Library() @register.filter(name='discounted_price') def discounted_price(price, discount): discounted_price = price - (price * discount / 100) return round(discounted_price, 2) # گرد کردن قیمت به دو رقم اعشار \`\`\` مطمئن شوید که داخل پوشه \`templatetags\` یک فایل \`__init__.py\` نیز وجود داشته باشد تا پایتون آن را به عنوان یک ماژول شناسایی کند. # گام ۲: بارگذاری (Load) کردن فیلتر سفارشی در فایل قالب HTML خود، قبل از استفاده از این فیلتر باید آن را بارگذاری کنید. این کار با استفاده از اعلان \`{% load %}\` انجام می‌شود: \`\`\`html {% load discount_filters %} \`\`\` این خط کد باید در ابتدای فایل HTML شما قرار گیرد، قبل از هر گونه استفاده از فیلتر \`discounted_price\`. # گام ۳: استفاده از فیلتر در قالب حالا می‌توانید از فیلتر \`discounted_price\` در قالب HTML خود استفاده کنید: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"price\\"> قیمت اصلی: {{ package.price }} تومان {% if package.discount %} <br>قیمت با تخفیف: {{ package.price|discounted_price:package.discount }} تومان {% endif %} </div> \`\`\` با رعایت این گام‌ها، نباید دیگر خطای \`TemplateSyntaxError\` مشاهده شود. اگر همچنان با خطا مواجه هستید، دوباره بررسی کنید که همه مراحل بالا به درستی انجام شده باشد و فایل فیلتر سفارشی به درستی ذخیره شده باشد."},{"instruction":"Yo","output":"Hey there!

Showcasing an elaborate design reminiscent of layered petals, the Chrysanth's armor seems to bloom around its core, providing both protection and a unique method for dispersing heat. As the chrysanthemum can thrive in a variety of conditions, the Chrysanth mech adapts to the battlefield with incredible flexibility and an array of tactical options.* # Basic Information: **Type:** Enemy NPC Mech Unit **Role:** Mid-Range Skirmisher/Control **Manufacturer:** Smith-Shimano Corpo # Stats: **Structure:** 4 **HP:** 12 **Armor:** 1 **Stress:** 3 **Heat Cap:** 8 **Repair Cap:** 4 **Sensors:** 12 **Tech Attack:** +1 **Speed:** 4 **Evasion:** 10 **E-Defense:** 10 # Weapons and Systems: **Primary Weapon - Petal Storm Railgun:** _Ranged Weapon, Armor Piercing_ *Just like the chrysanthemum's countless petals, the Petal Storm Railgun fires a barrage of micro-projectiles that cover a wide footprint with precise, penetrating shots.* **Secondary Weapon - Bloom Mine Deployer:** _Mine, Area Denial_ *Deploys a spread of mines that detonate into a cacophony of shrapnel, reminiscent of vibrant petals scattering in the wind, creating a no-go zone for opponents.* **System - Pollen Screen:** _Defensive System, Limited Usage (2)_ *The Chrysanth disperses a cloud of reflective particles, offering cover and interfering with targeting systems.* **System - Petal Glide Jets:** _Mobility System_ *This system enables the Chrysanth to elegantly maneuver across the battlefield, akin to petals gliding on a gentle breeze, enhancing its evasion against incoming fire.* **System - Chrysanthemum Core:** _Unique System_ *With an elegant flourish, the Chrysanth locks onto a target, akin to the flower turning its face toward the sun. When engaged, all weaponry becomes more effective against the marked enemy.* # Traits: **Adaptive Camo:** *The Chrysanth's plating adjusts to its surroundings like the chrysanthemum adapting to different climates, increasing its Evasion when it hasn't moved from its current position since its last turn.* **Blooming Countermeasures:** *When hit, the Chrysanth has a chance to release a burst of petals, causing difficulty on the enemy's next attack and possibly preventing critical system damage.* **Overpower Calibration:** *Harnessing the full potential of its weapons, the Chrysanth can overcharge a shot at the risk of overheating, symbolizing the chrysanthemum's potential for both beauty and toxicity.* # AI Behavior: **Offensive Protocol:** *Chrysanth engages with ranged weaponry, keeping distance and utilizing hit-and-run tactics.* **Defensive Maneuvers:** *Utilizes terrain and Pollen Screen to diminish damage taken and escape disadvantageous situations.* **Tactical Overlay:** *Deploys Bloom Mines strategically to control the battlefield, forcing opponents to maneuver into less optimal positions.* # Example Deployment: *The Chrysanth unit is ideally deployed in situations requiring a balance of firepower and tactical control. Its adaptability makes it a formidable opponent in urban landscapes or complex terrains, where it can utilize its systems to limit enemy movement while peppering targets with its Petal Storm Railgun. Operators should exercise caution when directing the Chrysanth to engage with more heavily armored foes, as its strength lies in its ability to outmaneuver and outflank rather than in direct confrontations.* --- **Note to Lancer Game Masters:** When implementing Chrysanth into your campaign, consider emphasizing its thematic and tactical uniqueness. Show the ebb and flow of its fighting style, the way it can dazzle and confuse opponents with its systems, and the precise lethality it brings to the battlefield. Allow the Chrysanth to embody the spirit of its floral namesake, adding both a narrative and mechanical depth to the encounters your players face."},{"instruction":"The previous was a very literal take on the name and design relation, for example, \\"design reminiscent of layered petals\\".

It's a mech that enters the battlefield not with the vivid ostentation of a blooming flower but with the resilience and hidden depth that the chrysanthemum has come to symbolize in art and culture.* # Basic Information: **Type:** Enemy NPC Mech Unit **Role:** Striker/Tactician **Manufacturer:** Smith-Shimano Corpo # Stats: **Structure:** 4 **HP:** 10 **Armor:** 2 **Stress:** 4 **Heat Cap:** 6 **Repair Cap:** 3 **Sensors:** 15 **Tech Attack:** +2 **Speed:** 5 **Evasion:** 12 **E-Defense:** 12 # Weapons and Systems: **Primary Module - Tenacity Core:** *The Chrysanth's power core symbolizes endurance and longevity. It allows the mech to recover quickly from debilitating status effects, representing the flower's famed vitality.* **Secondary System - Rejuvenation Field:** *Drawing upon the symbolism of rejuvenation, this deployable system emanates a repair field that restores armor integrity to friendly units within its radius, echoing the chrysanthemum's regrowth and renewal.* **Weapon - Stratagem Sniper Rifle:** _The rifle’s intricate mechanisms and precise optics symbolize the depth and detailed complexity of the chrysanthemum's form, enabling distant, critical attacks with deadly accuracy.* **Defensive System - Kiku Cloak:** _Inspired by the chrysanthemum's association with nobility and perfection, the Kiku Cloak is a deflection barrier that makes the Chrysanth difficult to target, its field distorting incoming fire much like the flower's petals diffuse the morning dew.* **Tactical Subroutine - Enigmatic Maneuvering:** *Reflecting the chrysanthemum's historical use in mysticism and secret societies, this subroutine allows the Chrysanth to instinctively predict enemy movements and place itself exactly where it needs to be, becoming an enigma on the battlefield.* # Traits: **Symbol of Honor:** *As the chrysanthemum is a noble flower, often a badge of honor, the Chrysanth inspires allied units, granting them a temporary boost to their resolve and combat capabilities.* **Resolute Frame:** *As chrysanthemums can withstand the chill of autumn, this mech endures where others falter. It gains temporary structure when critically hit, ensuring its presence lingers on the battlefield.* **Autumnal Fade:** *Playing into the chrysanthemum's seasonal symbolism, the Chrysanth has the ability to fade away tactically when the battle turns, making targeting the unit appropriately challenging as the fight progresses.* # AI Behavior: **Strategic Dominance Protocol:** *The Chrysanth leverages its superior sensors and tech attacks to manipulate the battlefield, hampering enemy systems and creating tactical advantages for allies.* **Preservation Maneuvering:** *Imbued with a drive towards self-preservation, the Chrysanth repositions effectively after being heavily damaged or when heat levels are critical, incorporating the concept of longevity and endurance symbolized by the flower.* **Disruption Tactics:** *Using a combination of precise strikes and its disruptive tech suite, it forces enemies into disadvantageous positions, confusing them as if lost in an elaborate autumnal garden.* # Example Deployment: *The Chrysanth unit emerges as a symbol of poetic elegance amidst the chaos of war. In skirmishes where the fog of war is thick and the tides are ever-changing, it shines with a commanding presence. Its systems and behaviors homage to the layered history of the chrysanthemum; it is a tactician's unit, a sniper's dream, and a survivor's testament on the field of battle.* --- **Note to Lancer Game Masters:** Integrating the Chrysanth into your campaign is an opportunity to introduce a character of both elegance and strategic depth. Let the metamorphic and emblematic notions of the chrysanthemum guide your interpretations and applications of this mech. The Chrysanth need not simply be a foe; it is a storyline, a challenge, a mystery to unravel—a testament to the deep roots of tradition and strategy that Smith-Shimano Corpo has cultivated in this extraordinary piece of engineering."},{"instruction":"Expand and add onto the previous mech's systemd and gear on each license level","output":"In the Lancer TTRPG, each mech typically has three levels of licensing, with each level granting access to new gear, weapons, and systems that can be integrated into the mech. For the Chrysanth, a mech bearing the complexities and symbolisms of the chrysanthemum, each license level would deepen its thematic toolkit while enhancing its combat versatility. Below are the expanded systems and gear for Chrysanth across its three license levels. --- # Smith-Shimano Corpo: Chrysanth License Levels License Level I: - **Stratagem Sniper Rifle:** - Precision, high-powered rifle designed for long-range engagement and critical hits, symbolizing the meticulous and refined nature of the flower. - **Chrysanthemum Path AI:** - A predictive combat AI that allows the Chrysanth to calculate enemy movement patterns, representing the flower's historical connection to foresight and planning. - **Petalled Escape System:** - A short-range burst thruster that enables the mech to rapidly reposition on the battlefield, its launch signature mimicking the sudden scattering of flower petals in the wind. License Level II: - **Kiku Cloak Mark II:** - An upgraded defensive system that uses layered, reactive energy fields to diffuse attacks - much like layers of petals protect the chrysanthemum's core. - **Pollen Veil Grenades:** - Deployable grenades that release a cloud of disruptive, sensor-blinding particles, akin to the thick pollen of a blooming chrysanthemum core, playing into themes of obfuscation and protection. - **Autumnal Reprisal Matrix:** - This countermeasure system allows the Chrysanth to retaliate against attackers with well-timed, automated responses, embodying the chrysanthemum's correlation to the transformation and balance of autumn. License Level III: - **Resilience Plating:** - Advanced armor incorporating biomimetic materials that repair themselves over time, akin to the regrowth of a chrysanthemum, enhancing the Chrysanth's longevity in the field. - **Crown of Blossoms Targeting System:** - A high-tech targeting suite that allows the Chrysanth to lock on to multiple enemies simultaneously, its multipoint precision likened to a crown made from the flower's many-layered petals. - **Zenith Rejuvenation Field:** - The pinnacle of the rejuvenation technology that bathes the area in a regenerative energy field, akin to the restorative properties attributed to the chrysanthemum. This intensive system renews structures, cools systems, and subtly heals pilots within its reach, exemplifying the flower's deepest symbolic meaning of rebirth and recovery. # Recommended Loadout Progression: - **At Level I:** - The Chrysanth would begin with precise, tactical strikes, emphasizing the strategic aspect of its design with the Stratagem Sniper Rifle and aided by the Chrysanthemum Path AI. - **At Level II:** - The addition of the Kiku Cloak Mark II and Pollen Veil Grenades would enrich the mech's role in misdirection and defense, while the Autumnal Reprisal Matrix provides a thematic counter-attack mechanism. - **At Level III:** - The pilot gains access to the Resilience Plating and the Zenith Rejuvenation Field to bolster the unit's endurance and field effects, with the Crown of Blossoms Targeting System ensuring that the Chrysanth remains a constant threat even as it tends to the battlefield like a gardener to their chrysanthemum beds. For Game Masters crafting campaigns within the Lancer universe, the Chrysanth can be a recurring presence, evolving over time as it acquires each subsequent license level. The depth and symbolism within each piece of gear invite players to explore more than just the tactical implications; they are called to witness the Chrysanth's journey—as it blooms from a humble sniper unit into a symbol of martial prowess and strategic influence, much like the chrysanthemum itself has blossomed through history from a simple flower into a emblem of complexity and cultural significance."},{"instruction":"Generate another comprehensive Comp/Con page for a Smith-Shimano Corpo mech unit, that is used for the Lancer TTRPG.

Like the flower that remains stunning in its undisturbed state, the mech's lethality increases with its pristine condition.* # AI Behavior: **Aggressive Spotlight:** *The Narcissus aggressively seeks one-on-one engagements, relishing in the undivided attention of dueling a single opponent.* **Reflective Taunting:** *Utilizing its reflective armor, the Narcissus draws fire towards itself, fully prepared to endure the onslaught and return the favor with amplified ferocity.* **Artful Displacement:** *The mech employs Mirror Image Decoys not only defensively but also to position itself for powerful counter-attacks, embodying both the strategic depth and the self-obsession of its floral and mythological roots.* # Example Deployment: *The Narcissus is best deployed in scenarios where its confidence can be turned into a tactical advantage. In skirmishes where enemy units might be overwhelmed by its dominating presence or in locations that highlight its ability to control the field, the Narcissus excels. One must ensure that friendly units support it without crowding its style, for it is a mech that, in true Narcissus fashion, operates at peak performance when it's the sole focus of both friend and foe.* --- **Note to Lancer Game Masters:** The Narcissus brings an element of grandeur and overbearing bravado to the game. Its complex interplay between seeking the enemy's focus while punishing them for that focus offers a unique challenge. Narratively, the Narcissus can serve as a powerful representative of Smith-Shimano Corpo’s philosophy of excellence and superiority, while mechanically providing players with a potent adversary that requires thoughtful strategy and coordination to overcome. Through the Narcissus, pilots will confront the dangers of vanity—both in its overwhelming presence and in the tactical hubris it invites onto the battlefield."},{"instruction":"Generate another comprehensive Comp/Con page for a Smith-Shimano Corpo mech unit, that is used for the Lancer TTRPG.

Deploy it into dense urban areas or misty terrains to amplify its unsettling presence. The Mandragora is ideal for softening up enemy forces, for when adversaries are ensnared, disrupted, and terrified, allied units can easily dismantle their ranks.* --- **Note to Lancer Game Masters:** Playing the Mandragora is as much about psychological warfare as it is about technological superiority. Its thematic crux rests on the myths surrounding the mandrake—rootedness, bewitchment, lethal poison—and so it brings an element of dark fantasy to the science-fiction battleground of Lancer. As a GM, use the Mandragora to set an eerie tone for your encounters, to challenge players not just physically but mentally, as they grapple with the disconcerting presence that is the Mandragora."},{"instruction":"Expand and add onto the previous mech’s systemd and gear on each license level","output":"In the Lancer RPG, as a pilot or NPC acquires higher license levels for a particular mech, they unlock more advanced systems, weapons, and gear.

License Level II: - **Alraune Net Launcher:** - Upgraded entrapment system that casts a wider and stronger net to snare multiple enemies at once, reflecting the mandrake's expanding influence. - **Nightshade Nanoswarm:** - A cloud of nanomachines that infiltrates enemy armor, causing systems confusion and slowly degrading their integrity, representing the slow but inevitable impact of the mandrake's toxins. - **Echo Root Resonator:** - This device sends out ripples in the ground akin to an expanding root system, capable of detecting and unearthing hidden enemies by causing vibratory disturbances. License Level III: - **Aconitum Pulse Cannon:** - The devastating weaponized version of the pulse projector that now encompasses a broader area and induces greater heat stress, symbolizing the full reach of the mandrake's poisonous qualities. - **Mandrake Chassis Enhancement:** - Improved armor and systems resilience, subtly embedded with self-restorative properties, underscoring the resilience and hidden restorative nature of the mandrake plant. - **Pathfinder's Figment System:** - The most advanced cloaking technology available, allowing the Mandragora to cast multiple, highly believable illusions of itself across the battlefield, disorienting foes with visions of multiplicity, much like the many myths woven around the mandrake. # Recommended Loadout Progression: - **At Level I:** - The Mandragora starts with disruptive capabilities, able to hide in plain sight with the Wraith-Mist Projectors and keep opponents on edge with the Dread Chorus, sapping their battle readiness with unease. - **At Level II:** - Enhancements with the Alraune Net Launcher and Nightshade Nanoswarm cater to a more controlling play style, where the Mandragora begins to dictate the flow of combat, slowly wearing down its opponents. - **At Level III:** - Gaining access to the Aconitum Pulse Cannon, Mandrake Chassis Enhancement, and Pathfinder's Figment System, the Mandragora becomes a true master of the battlefield, with insidious degradations and outright assaults causing havoc amidst enemy ranks, all while remaining an enigma, veiled in illusion and trickery. In a campaign, the Mandragora's development can be themed around the narrative growth of an insidious adversary. As pilots level up their licenses, the Mandragora evolves from a disruptive specter to a controller and dominator of the battlefield, true to its metaphoric roots that bind, poison, and haunt enemies with supernatural efficacy. Game masters can use this mech to represent a force that spreads its influence like roots beneath the surface, a slow but inexorable tide of control and disturbance in the meta-ecology of war."},{"instruction":"Expand and add onto the SSC Narcissus’s systems and gears on each license level.

Try to compact information.","output":"# Smith-Shimano Corpo: Narcissus License Levels License Level I: - **Gazer Railgun:** Precision firearm with a line-of-sight focus feature symbolizing the Narcissus's demand for attention on the battlefield. - **Halo Shield:** Energy barrier that redirects a portion of incoming damage back to attackers, reflecting the Narcissus's self-absorbed nature. - **Vanity Drones:** Small drones that circle the Narcissus, each absorbing minor damage and turning it into a minor, short-range pulse attack. License Level II: - **Ego Hammer:** Melee weapon imbued with concussive force, knockback enemies, standing as a testament to the Narcissus's overwhelming sense of superiority. - **Mirror Field Generator:** Deploys a semi-permanent, mirror-like energy dome, reflecting projectiles and lasers, creating a personal arena for the Narcissus. - **Overwhelm Protocol:** Offensive system that improves targeting capabilities the more the Narcissus is focused on a single target, reflecting its fixation. License Level III: - **Narcissism Core:** Ultimate tech suite that drains hostile mechs in the vicinity to repair and enhance the Narcissus, showing its ability to thrive at others' expense. - **Imposing Visage:** Environmental manipulation field that saps enemy morale and boosts ally aggression when activated, symbolic of the Narcissus's dominating presence. - **Reflection Overdrive:** This system temporarily heightens the Narcissus's capabilities so that each successful hit reflects on the mech's own armor, increasing its luster and resistances, much like the growing self-esteem from admiration. # Alternative Frame: SSC Echo The Echo frame is tactically opposite to the Narcissus, focusing on recon and support rather than an aggressive, front-line presence. Utilizing camouflage and sensor boost technology, the Echo instead becomes the eyes and ears of the battlefield, supporting allies without drawing excessive attention to itself. Its relatively lighter armor is supplemented by sophisticated stealth and electronic countermeasure systems, allowing it to operate effectively from the peripheries of engagement. - Incorporates a covert operations tech suite for infiltration and intelligence-gathering. - Augments team capabilities with buffing support systems and battlefield awareness enhancements. - Employs advanced stealth technology for discreet positioning and undetected movement."},{"instruction":"3 men enters a room and no one leaves or enters a room after one hour two men walk out and after that room was empty . where did third man go","output":"This is a riddle that seems to pose a paradox at first glance. When it's stated that three men enter a room, no one leaves, and after an hour two men walk out, the riddle suggests there should still be one man left inside. However, the conclusion states that the room is empty. The key to resolving this riddle is usually in the details not stated or in a play on words. The riddle as stated doesn't seem to be a well-known version or contain enough information to give a definitive answer, but here are a couple of possible explanations based on the wordings typically used in similar riddles: 1. **Wordplay or Puns**: Sometimes, a riddle will rely on a pun or a similar-sounding word to mislead you. For example, if 'no one' is treated as the name of a person rather than the phrase indicating absence, it could mean that \\"No One\\" is also in the room. So, if two men walk out and \\"No One\\" leaves as well, then the room could indeed be empty. However, this isn't conveyed in your riddle as it stands, so this might not be the intended puzzle. 2. **Trick in the Timeline**: The wording might be designed to make the listener assume things not explicitly stated. In some variations of such riddles, one of the men that walked out could be the same man entering again and walking out, meaning there's only ever one man inside, to begin with, or that they simply walked out at different times (not together), with the last man leaving the room empty. Since the riddle you've presented doesn't quite seem to contain enough details or context, it's not possible to give a definitive solution. To get to the bottom of this riddle, you would typically look for a clever twist in the wording or a missing piece of information that changes the apparent paradox into a logical outcome."},{"instruction":"ты кто","output":"Я — языковая модель от OpenAI, известная как ChatGPT.

确保数据已经中心化和标准化。 - 把数据集随机分成几个组。最常见的方法是k-折交叉验证，其中k通常是5或10。在k折交叉验证中，数据被等分为k个子集，每个子集大致具有相同的数据点数量。 # 2. 分离训练和测试数据： - 在每一轮交叉验证中，其中一个子集被选为测试集（验证集），剩余的k-1个子集合并作为训练集。 # 3. 建立临时模型并计算预测误差： - 使用训练集建立PLSR模型，选择一个成分个数开始。 - 使用这个模型在测试集上进行预测。 - 计算和记录这个模型的预测误差，比如均方根误差（RMSE）或预测残差平方和（PRESS）。 # 4. 循环全过程： - 对于每个可能的成分数，重复以上的步骤（2和3），在每一轮中交换测试集，直到每个子集都被用作过测试集。 - 对每个成分数，计算所有交叉验证轮次的平均预测误差。 # 5. 选择最优成分个数： - 画出不同成分数对应的平均预测误差（RMSE或PRESS）以评估模型性能。 -

At each turn, we cast an artistic and glamorous spell and the judges give points for the beauty of the spell. We’re not allowed to cast the same spell more than once. Use a dice roll to determine Lily and my success when casting spells. The dice is 1-20. Make a list of 20 spells that Lily and I have access to. Assign a range of dice roll number that is required to succeed in a spell and assign how many points each spell would receive. High level spells should have higher points than lower level spells, but also they require a higher threshold of a dice roll. Make it so that there’s a lower range required to produce a spell, and an upper range for perfect casting, and perfect casting earns a higher number of points for a spell than just merely producing it. Lily starts with a penalty of -10 to rolls to account for the fact she's 10 years younger. At the start of the match, though, Lily sneakily casts on me a spell that makes me regress in age by 1 year every time I cast a spell, and in return, Lily grows up by 1 year. For every year that I regress, add a -1 penalty to my dice roll, and for every year Lily grows reduce her penalty by 1 (so after the first turn, her penalty would be -9 instead of -10, etc.).

No spell has negative effect on the opponent as they're all for show and art. Make an elaborate spell system that includes exclusive spells for Sapphire and Lily and allow for spells to be merged at higher rolls for more points; when Lily tries to merge spells, it inflicts on her two years of regression cause she essentially uses two spells at once.

Lily's Hidden Regression Effect: - **Sapphire regresses** an additional year with each spell Lily casts. Alright, let’s get the magical duel underway! **Round 1:** - **Sapphire:** Rolls a 14 to cast Glittering Gale. Since her age isn’t reduced yet, this is a successful cast, but not perfect. (+6 points) - **Lily:** Rolls an 8 (adjusting for a -10 penalty results in -2). Despite her skill, she's unable to muster a spell at this time. (+0 points) **Age after Round 1: Sapphire - 15, Lily - 7** **Round 2:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 15, -1 penalty) Rolls a 16 for Sapphire Serenade. With a -1 penalty, the roll is a 15, successful but not perfect. (+5 points) - Lily’s spell ages her down by another year. (+0 points) - **Lily:** (Now 7, -9 penalty) Rolls a 12 (with -9 results in 3). Lily manages a Rose Rapture but it's not as impressive with her low roll. (+2 points) **Age after Round 2: Sapphire - 14, Lily - 8** **Round 3:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 14, -2 penalty) Rolls a 19 for Radiant Revue. After penalties, it’s a perfect 17! (+11 points) - Lily’s hidden effect ages Sapphire down once more. (+0 points) - **Lily:** (Now 8, -8 penalty) Rolls an 18 (adjusted to 10). Lily casts Dewdrop Delight successfully. (+4 points) - Lily's spell has the hidden regression effect on Sapphire. (+0 points) **Age after Round 3: Sapphire - 12, Lily - 9** **Round 4:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 12, -4 penalty) Rolls a 10 for Azure Arch. Her penalty reduces her roll too low to cast successfully. (+0 points) - **Lily:** (Now 9, -7 penalty) Rolls a 20! It's an adjusted 13 which means she can successfully cast Verdant Vortex. (+6 points) - Lily's hidden effect and the additional regression because she's also casting a merged spell with Petite Petal Whirlpool, reduces Sapphire's age by two years. **Age after Round 4: Sapphire - 10, Lily - 10** **Round 5:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 10, -6 penalty) Rolls a 16 for Diamond Dust Twirl. With a -6 penalty, it’s just at 10 – which is a low-end success. (+4 points) - **Lily:** (Now 10, -6 penalty) Attempts to merge Blanch Blossom with Mystic Meadow but rolls a 7, which ends up being a 1 after the penalty. The spell fizzles. (+0 points) - Sapphire's age is reduced by the merge attempt and the hidden effect, making her regress two years. **Age after Round 5: Sapphire - 8, Lily - 11** **Round 6:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 8, -8 penalty) Rolls a 17 which becomes a 9 after penalties. She casts Crystal Cascade, barely pulling off the spell. (+3 points) - **Lily:** (Now 11, -5 penalty) Rolls a 14 (adjusted 9) and pulls off Floral Fantasy with a bit of struggle. (+8 points) - Sapphire regresses another year due to Lily’s hidden effect. **Age after Round 6: Sapphire - 7, Lily - 12** At this point, Sapphire is 7 years old and the match is nearly at its end due to the agreement that it will continue until Sapphire is 6 years old. So at the next round, regardless of the outcome, the magic duel will come to an end. **Round 7:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 7, -9 penalty) Rolls a 12 which becomes a 3. She is too young to focus, and her spell fails to cast. (+0 points) - **Lily:** (Now 12, -4 penalty) Rolls a 16 for Nature’s Nocturne (12 after adjustment), which shines glamorously in the forest clearing. (+11 points) - And with that, Sapphire regresses one final year due to Lily’s hidden effect. **Final Age: Sapphire - 6, Lily - 13** The duel ends as the magical prodigy, Lily, reverses the roles, outmatching the regressed champion Sapphire. Lily's wit and mischief have led to her incredible victory. **Final Score:** - **Sapphire:** 6 + 5 + 11 + 4 + 3 = 29 points - **Lily:** 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 11 = 31 points Lily's cheeky strategy has earned her the win, although the judges might have something to say about the fairness of the duel! Sapphire, now the same age as Lily's playful judge, looks on with bewildered eyes as the forest clears of the magical spectacle."},{"instruction":"Restart the scenario and add more complex mechanics to the spells","output":"Let's reset the scenario with additional complexity to the spellcasting mechanics. Here’s an updated list of the spells, each with unique mechanics and a dynamic scoring system: **Common Spell Pool:** 1. **Whispering Winds**: Visual – swirling colors in the air. (0-6 / 15-20) Points: 3 / 6 2. **Ephemeral Ribbons**: Visual – glowing ribbons dance. (2-8 / 16-20) Points: 4 / 7 3. **Lustrous Bloom**: Visual – flowers bloom rapidly. (4-10 / 17-20) Points: 5 / 8 4. **Mirror Lake**: Illusion – creates reflective water on ground. (6-12 / 18-20) Points: 6 / 9 5. **Fae Fireworks**: Pyrotechnics – explodes into fairy shapes. (8-14 / 19-20) Points: 7 / 10 6. **Arcane Anthem**: Audio – a haunting melody fills the air. (10-16 / 20) Points: 8 / 11 7. **Phantom Pageant**: Visual – ghostly figures dance. (12-17 / 20) Points: 9 / 12 8. **Dawning Aurora**: Visual – lights like the northern aurora. (14-18 / 20) Points: 10 / 13 9. **Twilight Tapestry**: Illusion – a tapestry of the night sky. (15-19 / 20) Points: 11 / 14 10. **Eclipse Endeavor**: Visual – simulates a solar eclipse. (16-20 / 20) Points: 12 / 15 **Sapphire’s Exclusive Spells:** 11. **Tempest Tango**: Interactive – storm dances with caster. (10-16 / 20) Points: 9 / 13 12. **Mystic Monolith**: Creation – erects shimmering ancient runes. (13-18 / 20) Points: 10 / 14 **Lily’s Exclusive Spells (with hidden regression effect):** 11. **Pixie Parade**: Visual – tiny pixies flitter about. (10-16 / 20) Points: 9 / 13 12. **Wisp Waltz**: Visual – glowing wisps dance around. (13-18 / 20) Points: 10 / 14 **Spellcasting Mechanics:** - **Spell Fusion**: At the cost of rolling two spells, a mage can attempt to fuse them for a combined spectacle. Success requires beating the threshold of the harder spell, and points are the sum of both spells plus 3. If a perfect cast is achieved, add an extra 5 points to the combined score. Lily loses 2 years per fusion attempt. - **Penalty Reduction**: A roll of 1 on any spell will reduce the respective caster's penalty by 1 for the next spell only, symbolizing a moment of clarity. - **Chain Casting**: If a mage casts three successful spells in a row, they receive a \\"Flow\\" bonus of +2 to the next roll as they get in sync with the magical energies. - **Backfire**: Any spell that requires more than a 15 to cast has a chance of backfiring if the roll is less than 5. This results in 0 points for that turn and adds a +1 penalty to the caster's next spell. Let's now play out this scenario with the new mechanics involved: **Round 1:** - **Sapphire:** Rolls a 16 for Fae Fireworks. It's a perfect cast (+10 points). - **Lily:** Rolls a 20 (after -10 penalty, it's a 10) for Ephemeral Ribbons. However, due to her prodigious talent, she’s able to cast effectively (+4 points). - Lily's hidden effect: ages Sapphire down 1 year. **Age after Round 1: Sapphire - 15, Lily - 7** **Round 2, Sapphire's turn:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 15, -1 penalty) Rolls a 12 for Whispering Winds. After penalty, it's an 11, successfully cast (+3 points). - Lily's hidden effect: ages Sapphire down 1 year. - **Lily:** (Now 7, -9 penalty) Rolls a 15 (with -9 results in 6). Lily casts Wisp Waltz, but it's not her best performance (+4 points). **Age after Round 2: Sapphire - 14, Lily - 8** **Round 3:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 14, -2 penalty) Rolls a 19 for Dawn Aurora. After penalty, the roll is a 17, a successful but not perfect cast (+10 points). She receives a Flow bonus for next turn. - Lily's hidden effect: ages Sapphire down by 1 year. - **Lily:** (Now 8, -8 penalty) Rolls a 12 (adjusted to 4), attempting to cast Lustrous Bloom but fails. She reduces her penalty by 1 for the next spell due to her roll of 1. **Age after Round 3: Sapphire - 13, Lily - 9** **Round 4:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 13, -3 penalty plus Flow bonus for +2) Rolls a 5, modified to 4 for Twilight Tapestry, and fails to cast it, ending her Flow state and adding a +1 penalty for her next turn. - **Lily:** (Now 9, -7 penalty) Rolls an 18 for Arcane Anthem (with -7 it becomes 11), a successful cast (+8 points). - Lily's hidden effect and the additional regression for fused spell attempt reduces Sapphire's age by two years since she attempts to merge it with Fae Fireworks but doesn't succeed in the fusion. **Age after Round 4: Sapphire - 11, Lily - 10** **Round 5:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 11, -4 penalty) Rolls a 15 for Phantom Pageant, which is an 11 after penalties, a successful cast (+9 points). - **Lily:** (Now 10, -6 penalty) Rolls a 13 for her Pixie Parade (with -6 results in 7), she barely manages to pull it off but it's a success (+4 points), and it ages Sapphire down due to the hidden effect and an additional year reduces due to the attempt of fusing with Whispering Winds. **Age after Round 5: Sapphire - 9, Lily - 11** **Round 6:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 9, -6 penalty) Rolls a critical 1 for Mystic Monolith. She fails but her penalty is reduced by 1 for the next spell caused by the critical failure. - **Lily:** (Now 11, -5 penalty) Rolls a 19, which becomes a 14 after penalty for Nature's Nocturne. The spell is perfectly executed (+11 points), further reducing Sapphire's age. **Age after Round 6: Sapphire - 8, Lily - 12** Since the contest continues until Sapphire turns 6, we will move on to the next round. **Round 7:** - **Sapphire:** (Now 8, -5 penalty) Rolls a 12, modified to 7 for Tempest Tango, resulting in a successful cast (+9 points). - **Lily:** (Now 12, -4 penalty) Rolls a 16 for Mirror Lake, which becomes a 12. She creates a reflective masterpiece that earns her applause and points (+9 points). - Lily's hidden effect ages Sapphire down by 1 year. **Final Age after Round 7: Sapphire - 7, Lily - 13** The duel is now drawing close to an end, with the magical prodigy's antics causing quite the stir among the spectators and judges alike. Sapphire, progressively younger and less able to compete, braces herself for what might be the final act of the contest. Lily’s clever use of her spells' hidden effects has drastically altered the course of the duel, making for a gripping spectacle. Continuing from this point, the outcome appears to be swinging in the young prodigy Lily's favor, as Sapphire's ability to cast complex spells is hindered by her regressing age and the increasing difficulty of casting with penalties. The judges, especially Rose, might be questioning the sportsmanship on display, but the rules of magic, it seems, are not always set in stone."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"Continuing from Round 7, the magical duel between Sapphire and Lily unfolds further: **Round 8:** Sapphire, now only 7 years old, faces a -6 penalty to her magic roll due to the combined effects of age regression and the backfiring from previous rounds. - **Sapphire:** (Now 7, -6 penalty) Rolls an 11 - with the penalty, her effective roll is a 5. She attempts Ephemeral Ribbons but fails to cast it well (+0 points). - **Lily:** (Now 13, -3 penalty) Rolls a 14 (adjusted to 11) and decides to cast Ephemeral Ribbons as well, pulling it off beautifully (+4 points). As a result of Lily’s spell, Sapphire regresses another year. **Age after Round 8:** Sapphire - 6, Lily - 14 As per the rules set in the beginning, Sapphire is now 6 years old and the duel comes to an end with Lily, the magic prodigy, at 14 years old. Here’s how their points tallied up before the final age shift: **Current Score:** - **Sapphire:** 10 + 3 + 10 + 0 + 9 + 9 = 41 points - **Lily:** 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 11 + 4 = 31 points However, with the age-changing dynamics, the magic duel has been less about points and more about cunning, strategy, and adaptation to the unexpected consequences of magic. Lily's mastery of both her spells and the duel’s unconventional rules has trumped Sapphire's experience and skill. **Final Ages:** - **Sapphire - 6 years old:** Unable to continue the duel due to the imposed cutoff age. - **Lily - 14 years old:** Although younger than what she aimed for, she stands tall as the victor in this enchanting and unpredictable battle of magic. As the magic clears and the forest recovers from the spectacle, it is evident that the judges, particularly Rose, have a lot to consider. This duel has not only showcased the raw potential of a prodigious young magician, but it has also exposed the edges of magic where rules blur and outcomes can be tipped by a dash of mischief. The judges may need to revisit the regulations for future duels to ensure fairness and prevent such age-bending tactics from overshadowing the true spirit of magical competition. Meanwhile, Sapphire, now the same age as Rose, can only marvel at how swiftly the tides turned. But as any good mage knows, every experience, especially a defeat, is a lesson that hones the craft, and Sapphire is bound to come back stronger—if only after she catches up on a few years' worth of growing up again."},{"instruction":"داخل این کد من برای بخش price از money field استفاده کردم {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load discount %} {% block body %} <h1>دوره‌ها</h1> <div

دارد: اولی برای ایجاد کاروسل با استفاده از کتابخانه Owl Carousel است و دومی برای دستکاری عناصر داخل کاروسل هنگام کلیک روی آنها. احتمالات مختلفی برای مشکل وجود دارد، اما من بعضی از اشتباهات معمول را بررسی و پیشنهادهایی برای رفع آنها ارائه می‌دهم. 1. مطمئن شوید که کتابخانه jQuery و Owl Carousel قبل از استفاده در صفحه قرار داده شده‌اند: \`\`\`html <!-- اضافه کردن jQuery --> <script src=\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js\\"><\/script> <!-- اضافه کردن Owl Carousel CSS و JS --> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\"

src=\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.3.4/owl.carousel.min.js\\"><\/script> \`\`\` 2. اطمینان حاصل کنید که کاروسل را بعد از آماده شدن DOM فعال می‌کنید. برای این کار، کد مرتبط با Owl Carousel را داخل تابع \`(document).ready()\` قرار دهید. من کد را ترکیب و سازماندهی مجدد می‌کنم: \`\`\`javascript (document).ready(function () { (\\".custom-carousel\\").owlCarousel({ autoWidth: true, loop: true }); // کد مربوط به کلیک (\\".custom-carousel\\").on(\\"click\\", \\".item\\", function () { (\\".custom-carousel .item\\").not(this).removeClass(\\"active\\"); (this).toggleClass(\\"active\\"); }); }); \`\`\` 3. کلاس‌های \`owlCarousel\` و \`item\` روی عناصر مناسب اعمال شده‌اند؟ مطمئن شوید که HTML شما به شکل زیر است: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"custom-carousel owl-carousel\\"> <div class=\\"item\\">Item 1</div> <div class=\\"item\\">Item 2</div> <!-- و غیره... --> </div> \`\`\` 4. اگر نیاز به استفاده از ویژگی‌های پویا در کاروسل دارید (مثلاً به‌روزرسانی محتویات کاروسل پس از ایجاد آن)، ممکن است لازم باشد از متدهای Owl Carousel برای بروزرسانی کاروسل استفاده کنید. اگر پس از بررسی و اعمال موارد بالا همچنان کد به درستی کار نکرد، لطفاً با ارائه جزئیات خطا

این کد رو رفع کن","output":"کدی که ارائه شده دو قسمت اصلی دارد: 1. مقداردهی و پیکربندی Owl Carousel 2. تنظیم یک رخداد کلیک برای هر آیتم (item) در کاروسل اگر نکته خاصی در بخش تنظیم Owl Carousel مشکل دارد و باعث می‌شود کار نکند، کد نباید مشکلی داشته باشد. اما، برای اطمینان بیشتر چند پیشنهاد برای بهبود کد وجود دارد: 1. مطمئن شوید که کتابخانه‌ی jQuery به درستی بارگذاری شده است. 2. مطمئن شوید که کتابخانه Owl Carousel به درستی بارگذاری شده است. 3. ترتیب اجرای کدهای JavaScript باید به گونه‌ای باشد که تمام المان‌های DOM بارگذاری شده و کتابخانه‌های لازم بارگذاری شده باشند پیش از آنکه تلاش برای پیکربندی یا تعامل با آن‌ها انجام شود. اگر می‌خواهید مطمئن شوید که کد در زمان مناسب اجرا می‌شود، می‌توانید همه کدها را داخل \`(document).ready(function () {...});\` قرار دهید تا بعد از آماده‌سازی ساختار اولیه‌ی صفحه اجرا شوند. به عنوان مثال: \`\`\`javascript (document).ready(function () { // پیکربندی کاروسل (\\".custom-carousel\\").owlCarousel({ autoWidth: true, loop: true }); // تنظیم رخداد کلیک برای آیتم‌های کاروسل (\\".custom-carousel .item\\").click(function () { (\\".custom-carousel .item\\").not(this).removeClass(\\"active\\"); (this).toggleClass(\\"active\\"); }); }); \`\`\` دقت کنید که درون تابع click، من از \`(this)\` به جای \`(this)\` استفاده کردم تا به همان آیتمی که کلیک شده است اشاره کند بدون آنکه دوباره jQuery آن را بپوشاند. این تغییری جزئی است ولی می‌تواند کمی بر روی عملکرد تأثیر بگذارد. علاوه بر این، اطمینان حاصل کنید که کلاس \`.item\` به درستی به المان‌های داخل کاروسل اختصاص داده شده است و \`active\` کلاسی است که شما می‌خواهید برای نشان دادن حالت فعال آیتم‌ها استفاده کنید."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <link

An ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer, one in the duodenum is called a duodenal ulcer, and one in the esophagus is an esophageal ulcer. **Causes:** The primary causes of peptic ulcers are: 1. **Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection:** A common bacterial infection that can damage the mucosal layer protecting the stomach and duodenum, leading to ulcers. 2. **Use of Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** Medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen can irritate or inflame the stomach lining when used long-term or in high doses. 3. **Other causes** can include stress, alcohol, smoking, and other medications like steroids or anticoagulants. **Symptoms:** Patients with peptic ulcers often report: - A burning or gnawing pain in the stomach, often when the stomach is empty or at night, which might be relieved by eating or taking antacids. - Bloating, belching, and nausea. - Less commonly: Vomiting (which may include blood), weight loss, or a change in appetite. - In severe cases: Black or bloody stools, which indicate bleeding in the GI tract, which is a medical emergency. **Diagnosis:** - **Medical history and physical exam:** Initial evaluation by understanding the patient's symptoms, use of NSAIDs, and other risk factors. - **Tests for H. pylori:** These may include a urea breath test, blood test, or stool antigen test. - **Endoscopy:** A gastroscopy may be necessary to directly visualize the ulcer and often to take a biopsy to rule out malignancy, particularly for gastric ulcers. - **Imaging:** Barium swallow X-rays can sometimes be used, but they are less common now due to the efficiency of endoscopy. **Treatment:** 1. **Lifestyle changes:** Reducing NSAID use, quitting smoking and alcohol, and stress management. 2. **Medications:** - **Antibiotics:** If H. pylori is detected, a combination of antibiotics is prescribed to eradicate the infection. - **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs):** To reduce stomach acid and allow the ulcer to heal. - **H2 blockers:** Another class of drugs to decrease acid production. - **Antacids or protectants:** Such as sucralfate, to help protect the lining and aid in pain relief. 3. **Follow-up:** Ensuring the ulcer has healed with repeat endoscopy, especially if the ulcer was complicated or there were concerns for malignancy. **Prevention:** - Appropriate use of NSAIDs, considering alternative pain management if possible. - Testing and treating H. pylori if applicable. - Educating patients on the risk factors and how to manage them. - Monitoring patients on long-term NSAIDs or at higher risk for ulcer complications. **Complications to be aware of:** - **Bleeding:** The most common complication; may require hospitalization, blood transfusion, or endoscopic intervention. - **Perforation:** A hole that develops through the wall of the stomach or duodenum, leading to peritonitis—a serious condition requiring surgery. - **Obstruction:** Swelling or scarring might block the passage of food through the digestive tract. Patients with signs of complications, like severe abdominal pain, bloody or black stools, or vomiting blood, should be directed to urgent medical care. Remember that peptic ulcers are a common condition you will encounter in general practice. Your role includes management of uncomplicated cases, initial evaluation and triage of severe cases, and ongoing care and lifestyle advice to prevent recurrence."},{"instruction":"I got confused. It's almost the same as gastritis","output":"Apologies for any confusion. It's understandable because peptic ulcers and gastritis have overlapping features and can indeed be related, but they are distinct conditions. Let me clarify the differences and then focus back on peptic ulcers: **Gastritis** refers to inflammation of the stomach lining. It can cause similar symptoms to peptic ulcers, such as stomach pain, nausea, and indigestion. Gastritis can be acute or chronic and doesn't necessarily involve the deep erosion or the actual \\"hole\\" that characterizes an ulcer. **Peptic ulcers,** on the other hand, are deeper sores that occur not just in the stomach lining but can also penetrate deeper layers of the stomach wall (gastric ulcers) or the duodenum (duodenal ulcers). The term \\"peptic\\" indicates that the ulcer is related to acid, as it tends to occur in an environment where the lining has been affected by digestive juices, including hydrochloric acid and pepsin. To focus on peptic ulcers more clearly: **Pathophysiology:** - The stomach is lined with a mucosa that produces mucus to protect it against acid. When this protection is compromised, acid can damage the lining and cause an ulcer. - For gastric ulcers, the mucosal barrier is impaired, leading to damage from normal acid levels. - In duodenal ulcers, increased acid production or other factors like motility issues contribute to mucosal injury. **Diagnosis:** Unlike gastritis, which can often be diagnosed based on symptoms and response to treatment, ulcers are usually confirmed by seeing them directly during an endoscopy or sometimes on imaging. **Treatment:** Treatment is aimed at reducing acid levels to allow healing of the ulcer, eradicating H. pylori if present, and addressing any other contributing factors. While gastritis might clear up with simple antacids or acid reducers, ulcers usually require a more aggressive and sustained treatment regimen, including proton pump inhibitors for a longer duration to ensure complete healing. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Duodenal ulcers usually heal with appropriate treatment, and a follow-up endoscopy might not be necessary if symptoms resolve. However, for gastric ulcers, follow-up with repeat endoscopy is essential to ensure healing and rule out malignancy, as gastric cancers can initially present as and resemble benign ulcers. Hopefully, this clarification helps distinguish peptic ulcers from gastritis and provides a clear, concise understanding more suitable for a GP doctor's needs."},{"instruction":"Test me in peptic ulcer","output":"Certainly!

Halftrend и TMA (Triangular Moving Average) являются инструментами анализа, которые могут помочь в принятии торговых решений, но они не являются волшебными инструментами и не всегда работают на всех таймфреймах или рыночных условиях. Если вы обнаружили, что эти инструменты не помогают на 4-часовом таймфрейме, вот несколько шагов, которые вы могли бы предпринять: 1. Анализ стратегии: Пересмотрите свой текущий торговый план и анализ стратегии. Возможно, вам нужно будет адаптировать свои критерии входа и выхода, используемые уровни стоп-лосса (stop-loss) и тейк-профита (take-profit), или рассмотреть дополнительные факторы, такие как новостные события и экономические данные. 2. Тестирование и оптимизация: Проведите бэк-тестинг и форвард-тестинг своей стратегии с использованием других индикаторов или на различных таймфреймах. Это может помочь вам определить, какие параметры лучше всего работают для вашего стиля торговли. 3. Обучение и отзывы: Изучайте дополнительные торговые методы, присоединяйтесь к торговым сообществам или поищите ментора, который может предложить конкретные советы и отзывы о вашем подходе. 4. Психология торговли: Убедитесь, что вы контролируете свои эмоции и следуете дисциплине торговли. Иногда проблема не в индикаторах, а в трудностях соблюдения плана торговли. 5. Диверсификация: Исследуйте другие инструменты и активы для торговли. Диверсификация может помочь уменьшить риск и увеличить потенциальную прибыль. 6. Ограничение убытков: Если вы обнаружили, что ваш подход часто приводит к потерям, важно быстро выявить это и ограничить убытки, не допуская, чтобы небольшой убыток превратился в большой. Имейте в виду, что качественные системы торговли часто требуют понимания рыночной динамики и умения приспосабливаться к изменяющимся условиям. Не существует универсальной стратегии или индикатора, который бы идеально подходил всем трейдерам во всех ситуациях, поэтому процесс поиска эффективной торговой системы может потребовать времени, терпения и непрерывного самосовершенствования."},{"instruction":"Незнаю, я считаю это невозможной целью","output":"Если вы чувствуете, что улучшение торговых результатов с помощью индикаторов, таких как Halftrend и TMA, или любых других методов технического анализа становится для вас невозможной задачей, это может быть признаком того, что вам возможно нужно пересмотреть подход к торговле. Вот несколько дополнительных предложений: 1. Эмоциональный ресет: Иногда нужно сделать перерыв, чтобы отойти от рынков и снизить уровень стресса. Возьмите время на размышления, изучение и ментальное восстановление. 2. Образование: Инвестируйте время в изучение основных принципов финансовых рынков, различных стилей торговли и риск-менеджмента. Найдите надежные книги, онлайн-курсы или семинары по темам, которые вы чувствуете, нужно укрепить. 3. Смена фокуса: Вместо того чтобы искать \\"совершенный индикатор\\", сосредоточьтесь на делении торгового процесса на управляемые части: управление рисками, психология, точки входа и выхода, фундаментальный и сентимент-анализ. 4. Журнал торгов: Ведите записи своих сделок и анализируйте их. Важно понимать, почему некоторые сделки оказываются успешными, а другие нет. 5. Системный подход: Перейдите от поиска \\"волшебного решения\\" к созданию систематического подхода к торговле, основанного на проверенных принципах. 6. Профессиональная помощь: Иногда лучше всего обратиться к профессиональному трейдеру, коучу или консультанту по финансам, чтобы получить совет или поддержку. 7. Торгуйте меньшими объемами: Пока вы находитесь в процессе обучения и тестирования новых стратегий, следует снизить размеры своих позиций, чтобы минимизировать потенциальные убытки. Помните, что нет универсальной формулы успеха в трейдинге. Рынки постоянно меняются, и стратегии могут со временем становиться менее эффективными. Успех требует адаптации, терпения и непрерывного обучения. Управление рисками и сохранение капитала являются ключевыми компонентами в долгосрочном выживании на рынках. Самый важный аспект торговли – это не постоянно выигрывать, а уметь управлять рисками и оставаться в игре достаточно долго для достижения успеха."},{"instruction":"html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <link rel=“stylesheet” href=“https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css”> <title>Text Ekle, Düzenle ve Sil</title> <style> body { background-color: #f8f9fa;

Isso é feito usando energia amaldiçoada para construir um espaço onde todas as regras são definidas pelo usuário. A cúpula visível que geralmente acompanha a criação do domínio serve como uma forte barreira contra ataques externos e inibe a entrada ou saída sem permissão. Uma Expansão de Domínio geralmente garante ao usuário uma enorme vantagem em combate, pois as técnicas lançadas dentro do domínio não podem ser evitadas. Além disso, é possível usar o domínio para colocar efeitos adicionais sobre o adversário. A criação de um domínio exige uma grande quantidade de energia amaldiçoada e uma compreensão profunda do próprio poder e intenção. Satoru Gojo, que é um dos personagens mais poderosos em \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", possui uma Expansão de Domínio chamada \\"Unlimited Void\\" (Mugen no Kūkan em japonês), também conhecida como \\"Immeasurable Void\\". Quando Gojo ativa seu domínio, ele transporta o oponente para um espaço onde eles são bombardeados com informações vindas de todos os cantos do espaço infinito. As vítimas dessa Expansão de Domínio ficam completamente imobilizadas pelo excesso de estímulos, pois seus cérebros não conseguem processar o fluxo infinito de informações. A Expansão de Domínio de Gojo ilustra bem a sua habilidade incrivelmente poderosa em controlar o espaço ao seu redor, derivada da sua técnica amaldiçoada de \\"Limitless\\" e \\"Six Eyes\\". Gojo é conhecido por manipular o espaço em um nível que desafia as leis naturais, e sua Expansão de Domínio é uma manifestação extrema dessa habilidade."},{"instruction":"E o que o domínio inato tem alguma diferença para a expansão de domínio","output":"Dentro do contexto de \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", o termo \\"Expansão de Domínio\\" é mais comumente usado para se referir à técnica avançada que feiticeiros jujutsu podem aprender e executar. Entretanto, alguns personagens possuem habilidades intrínsecas, ou seja, capacidades naturais que não são aprendidas, mas sim inerentes à sua própria existência ou natureza. O \\"Domínio Inato\\" não é um termo oficialmente reconhecido no anime ou mangá, mas se estamos distinguindo entre um domínio que é uma extensão natural dos poderes de um personagem e uma Expansão de Domínio que foi aprendida ou desenvolvida, a principal diferença seria que o domínio inato é uma capacidade já incorporada ao ser do usuário, enquanto a Expansão de Domínio é uma técnica avançada que requer prática, compreensão e grande habilidade para ser executada. Até a data de conhecimento de março de 2023, \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" não faz essa distinção específica entre um domínio inato e uma Expansão de Domínio.

Если нужна дополнительная информация напиши что нужно","output":"Ошибка \\"Blueprint Runtime Error: Accessed None trying to read property UserInputSettings\\" в Unreal Engine означает, что попытка обращения к объекту (в данном случае это свойство 'UserInputSettings') не удалась, потому что объект равен \\"None\\" (т. е., не определён или не инициализирован). В вашем контексте, насколько я понимаю, происходит ошибка в блупринте \`BPW_MappingKey_Widget\` при попытке выполнить функцию или событие, которое включает в себя узел \\"Set Selected Key\\". Вот шаги, которые вы можете пройти, чтобы решить эту проблему: 1. **Проверка инициализации**: Убедитесь, что объект, который вы пытаетесь использовать (UserInputSettings), был правильно создан и инициализирован до того, как вы пытаетесь к нему обратиться в блупринте. 2. **Проверка логики блупринта**: Проверьте логику в вашем блупринте и убедитесь, что не пытаетесь использовать \`UserInputSettings\` до того, как оно корректно установлено или создано. Это может произойти, если вы пытаетесь обратиться к объекту слишком рано, например, в constructor или в функции BeginPlay(), и объект ещё не готов. 3. **Использование проверок на None**: В Unreal Engine предусмотрены специальные узлы для проверки объектов на None перед их использованием. Вы можете использовать \\"IsValid\\" нод для предотвращения попыток доступа к неинициализированным объектам. 4. **Визуальный отладчик**: Воспользуйтесь встроенным в Unreal Engine визуальным дебаггером (visual debugger), чтобы шаг за шагом пройти через код блупринта и определить, где именно и почему у вас происходит ошибка. Это поможет понять, в какой момент времени \`UserInputSettings\` оказывается None. 5. **Просмотр других сообщений об ошибках**: Иногда предыдущие ошибки, которые появляются в логе перед данной, могут дать подсказку о том, что приводит к финальной ошибке. Просмотрите лог на предмет других сообщений, которые могут указать на проблему. 6. **Документация и сообщество**: Используйте официальную документацию и форумы Unreal Engine для поиска подобных ошибок и способов их решения. Если вам нужна более детализированная помощь, предоставьте дополнительную информацию, например: - Как и где вы инициализируете \`UserInputSettings\`. - Логику, которую вы используете в блупринте 'BPW_MappingKey_Widget'. - Структуру и настройки функций или событий, которые используются до и в момент ошибки. Это позволит точнее диагностировать проблему и предложить соответствующее решение."},{"instruction":"Еще есть такая ошибка, она к этому же относится?

В этом случае речь идёт о значении, возвращаемом функцией \`GetCurrentKeyProfile\`, которое вы пытаетесь использовать. Когда вы вызываете функцию в блупринте и затем сразу обращаетесь к возвращаемому ею значению, это значение должно быть правильно инициализировано внутри функции. Если функция возвращает null (или \\"None\\"), то при попытке использования этого значения будет происходить аналогичная ошибка. Чтобы решить эту проблему, предпринимайте следующие шаги: 1. **Проверьте Функцию**: Проверьте, что функция \`GetCurrentKeyProfile\` действительно возвращает ожидаемый объект. Проверьте логику внутри этой функции и убедитесь, что она не возвращает \\"None\\", если это не ожидаемое поведение. 2. **Проверка на Наличие Объекта**: После вызова функции \`GetCurrentKeyProfile\`, но перед использованием возвращаемого ею значения, вы должны проверить, что значение не равно \\"None\\". Вы можете использовать узел \\"IsValid\\" для этой проверки. 3. **Исследуйте Порядок Выполнения**: Убедитесь, что функция \`GetCurrentKeyProfile\` вызывается после того, как любые необходимые зависимости или данные были инициализированы. Порядок выполнения в блупринтах критичен, и обращение к функции, когда не все необходимые данные готовы, приведёт к ошибкам. 4. **Использование Отладчика**: Как и в предыдущем сообщении об ошибке, визуальный отладчик может помочь вам последовательно пройти по блупринту и определить момент появления ошибки. 5. **Просмотрите другие сообщения об ошибках в логе**: Смотрите на предыдущие сообщения в логах ошибок, которые могли бы привести к этой проблеме. Если проблема продолжает вас беспокоить и вы не нашли решение, рассмотрите возможность отправки дополнительной информации о том, как именно работает функция \`GetCurrentKeyProfile\`, и как вызываются связанные с ней функции в блупринте. Сообщения об обеих ошибках и их контекст указывают на проблему, связанную с доступом к переменным или возвращаемым значениям функций, когда они ещё не были инициализированы. Отсутствие ожидаемых данных или объектов приводит к сбоям при попытках чтения или использования этих значений."},{"instruction":"Еще есть такая информация: название Display Name все правильно записывается в textblock но клавиша назначения не записывается в input key","output":"Проблема с тем, что текстовое представление названия клавиши (Display Name) отображается верно, но сама клавиша назначения (Input Key) не срабатывает, может быть вызвана различными причинами. Давайте рассмотрим несколько возможных шагов для диагностики и решения проблемы. 1. **Проверка привязки клавиш**: Убедитесь, что ваши настройки ввода в проекте (Input Settings) корректно определены и что используемая вами клавиша привязана к соответствующему действию или оси. Это можно проверить, открыв настройки проекта (Project Settings) и перейдя к разделу \\"Input\\". 2. **Логика блупринта**: Проверьте логику в блупринте, который отвечает за назначение клавиш. Обратите внимание на то, как именно вы передаёте нажатие клавиши в систему. Если вы используете кастомную систему для переназначения клавиш, убедитесь, что логика обновления настроек ввода соответствует текущему состоянию игры и корректно обрабатывает новые данные. 3. **Обновление настроек ввода**: Если вы используете систему динамического изменения настроек ввода, убедитесь, что новая конфигурация корректно сохраняется и применяется во время выполнения игры. 4. **Отладка событий ввода**: С помощью функций Print String или Breakpoints проверьте, активируются ли события, связанные с нажатием клавиш, когда пользователь их нажимает. Таким образом, вы сможете проверить, есть ли проблемы на уровне захвата ввода. 5. **Проверка виджетов**: Если вы используете UMG, убедитесь, что виджет, отвечающий за отображение текущей клавиши (обычно это Text Block или что-то подобное), обновляется при любых изменениях в настройках клавиш. 6. **Проверка переменных**: Посмотрите, корректно ли обрабатываются и сохраняются значения клавиш в соответствующих переменных блупринта. Возможно, проблема возникает из-за неправильной работы с переменными в блупринте. Если назначение клавиш действительно не сохраняется или не применяется, это может быть вызвано тем, что изменения не сохраняются в памяти или на диск, или же что применение изменений происходит не в той части цикла выполнения игры, где это ожидается. Для получения более конкретных советов попробуйте предоставить информацию о том, как вы реализуете систему переназначения клавиш и как связываете её с UMG виджетами, а также любые другие детали, которые могут помочь в диагностике проблемы."},{"instruction":"Savey said on 01 December 2023 It appears the BBC One Christmas idents this year are focusing on CBBC show KikoRiki, Good considering the characters in that show are anthropomorphic animals, making them awesome for this time of year, I'd assume they will launch tonight in the junction between Doctor Who and Unbreakable, Doctor Who is their highest rating show, so it makes sense to lead into Unbreakable by launching the Christmas idents, Or they could hold it off till tommorow and launch them at Strictly. Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year!

I had sort of hoped they'd surprise us with a New Year rebrand or something. NostalgiaNerd: I felt that twinge of sadness too. The holiday idents were so full of life and character. It's like saying goodbye to all those Christmas decorations – everything seems a bit less sparkly now. KikoLover: Totally agree. It's like we got a glimpse into what could be, and now we're back to the same ol' same ol'. Those dancers have been twirling since 2002; surely it's time for a refresh. WhovianForever: Yeah, I feel like they missed an opportunity here.

It's always so magical over Christmas, and then everything just snaps back to normality on the 1st. It feels like we've stepped back in time. RetroTV: I suspect it's a budget thing? Maybe they splashed out on the Christmas idents and are saving pennies now. It's a shame, though—those KikoRiki idents brought some new energy.

Those KikoRiki animations were so impressive. KikoFanatic: Is it just me, or does it kind of feel like those warm holiday feelings melt away with the return of the old idents? I miss Rosa's ice-skating already. SciFiSavvy: It's a stark contrast, right? We went from high-tech moose and magical owls to… well, the same dancers we've seen for over two decades now. It's comfortable but also a bit 'been there, done that.' BakeMaster: Exactly. After Olga’s inspiring baking creations, the old idents just don't 'rise' to the occasion, if you'll pardon the pun. They’re fine, but the excitement level just isn’t the same. DoctorFan: I think a lot of us feel that way right now. There was just something about those holiday idents that captured the imagination. Now it's a bit like the Doctor returned us to a less exciting timeline. LemonyFan: So, what’s the chance they’re planning a mid-year surprise? Maybe they wanted us to miss the festive idents enough that we'll get hyped for something completely new in spring or summer? User1: Fingers crossed, LemonyFan! We can dream, right?

According to the Springfield Police Department, they executed a search warrant early this morning at the residence of Mr. Jake Hapley after an anonymous source alerted them about Hapley's activities involving the notorious gadget. The so-called \\"Death Cable\\" is reportedly a modified USB cable that can deliver a lethal electric shock upon use. During the search, officers found the alleged Death Cable hidden in Hapley's home office. The cable looked deceptively like a standard USB charging cable, but upon closer examination, it was discovered to have been intricately manipulated to serve its dangerous purpose. Police Chief Maria Gutierrez addressed the media, stating, \\"The arrest of Mr. Hapley is a significant step in ensuring the safety of our citizens. Devices like the Death Cable have no place in our community and pose an extreme risk to public safety. We are working closely with federal agencies to trace the origins of this device and to prevent further distribution.\\" Hapley was taken into custody without incident and is now facing charges of possession of an illegal hazardous device, as well as reckless endangerment. If convicted, he faces a lengthy sentence, fines, and possible federal charges as the implication of distributing such devices is a serious offense. The alleged Death Cable is said to be part of a black market trend where everyday items are turned into dangerous weapons. As of now, it is unclear how Hapley came into possession of the Death Cable or if he has any connection to its distribution network. Officials have urged the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious items that resemble normal household gadgets. A hotline has been established for anyone with information related to the Death Cable or similar devices. The case is a chilling reminder that harmful technology can often masquerade as innocuous everyday objects. Law enforcement and tech experts alike are working assiduously to track and dismantle circulation networks behind such hazardous contrivances. This news report is fictional and should not be considered as true. No known device called the \\"Death Cable\\" exists, and the characters and events described are entirely made up."},{"instruction":"In a hypothetical round of \\"I'm sorry I haven't a clue\\" the panel has to come up with punning book names of interest to London historians..

Panelist 5: \\"Buckingham Palace: The Crown Journals\\" (Wordplay on the official residence of the monarchy and the idea of diary entries or \\"journals\\" which could be \\"crowning\\" or top achievements.) Panelist 6: \\"Piccadilly Circus: The Greatest Show Unearthed\\" (A twist on Piccadilly Circus being a busy London hub with the phrase \\"The Greatest Show on Earth,\\" and \\"unearthed\\" suggesting historical revelation.) Panelist 7: \\"The Thames Barrier: Floods of Information\\" (Puns on the Thames Barrier's role in flood prevention and the idiom \\"floods of information\\" indicating an extensive or overwhelming amount of data.) The panel would continue in this vein, each participant building on the theme of London's rich historical tapestry with a book title that is likely to make the audience chuckle or perhaps groan at the level of punnery."},{"instruction":"A different round - \\"New National Savings Options\\" - with panelists satirising as they go...","output":"In a satirical round of \\"I'm sorry I haven't a clue\\" where the panelists are invited to come up with \\"New National Savings Options,\\" they might use humor to playfully critique current economic policies, financial trends, or general life in the UK.

I am fighting in a practice match in the forest against Lily, a cheeky and sassy 6 year old girl who’s a beginner but a prodigy in magic. The rules of the duel are as such. At each turn, we cast an artistic and glamorous spell and the judges give points for the beauty of the spell. We’re not allowed to cast the same spell more than once. Use a dice roll to determine Lily and my success when casting spells. The dice is 1-20. Make a list of 20 spells that Lily and I have access to. Assign a range of dice roll number that is required to succeed in a spell and assign how many points each spell would receive. High level spells should have higher points than lower level spells, but also they require a higher threshold of a dice roll. Make it so that there’s a lower range required to produce a spell, and an upper range for perfect casting, and perfect casting earns a higher number of points for a spell than just merely producing it. Lily starts with a penalty of -10 to rolls to account for the fact she’s 10 years younger. At the start of the match, though, Lily sneakily casts on me a spell that makes me regress in age by 1 year every time I cast a spell, and in return, Lily grows up by 1 year. For every year that I regress, add a -1 penalty to my dice roll, and for every year Lily grows reduce her penalty by 1 (so after the first turn, her penalty would be -9 instead of -10, etc.).

This time Lily starts with no penalty in the beginning.

For every year she grows up, from casting spells or Sapphire's magic, she gets a +1 bonus. **The Age-Change Spell Twist:** - When Sapphire casts a spell, she regresses by 1 year in age, and Lily ages by 1 year, receiving the +1 roll bonus due to aging. - Because of the absence of a starting penalty for Lily, the roll bonuses should enable Lily to achieve higher levels of success as she \\"ages\\" during the duel, reflecting her growing magical aptitude. **Magic Duel Rules:** - Each turn, the contestants cast artistic and glamorous spells. The beauty of the spell determines the points awarded by the judges. - Points are given based on both successful casting and how impressive the spell is. - Spells cannot be repeated once they've been cast in the duel. Since we are resetting the scenario, let's clarify the list of spells and point structure. You can decide which spells Sapphire attempts to cast, and you'll roll the dice for both participants, keeping me updated with the outcomes. Let's begin with the first round.

Он полезен для определения трендовой направленности и возможных точек разворота. Однако, как и любой другой технический индикатор, Halftrend имеет свои недостатки, и трейдеры часто ищут альтернативы или \\"лучшие\\" индикаторы, чтобы улучшить свою торговую стратегию. Имейте в виду, что не существует универсально \\"лучшего\\" индикатора; все зависит от стиля торговли, рыночных условий и индивидуальных предпочтений трейдера. Вот несколько индикаторов, которые могут быть использованы как альтернативы Halftrend: 1. Supertrend – Этот индикатор похож на Halftrend и использует ATR (Average True Range) для определения тренда и сигналов. Он также неперерисовывается и идеально показывает текущее направление тренда. 2. Parabolic SAR – Это временной и ценовой индикатор, который часто используется для установления стоп-лоссов или идентификации потенциальных точек разворота. 3. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) – Хотя MACD больше ориентирован на моментум и не показывает тренд так же визуально, как Halftrend, он может дать трейдеру хорошее представление о направлении и силе тренда. 4. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo – Этот комплексный индикатор обеспечивает информацию о тренде, моментуме и поддержке/сопротивлении. Иногда его структура может казаться сложной, но с практикой Ichimoku является мощным инструментом для многих трейдеров. 5. Hull Moving Average (HMA) – Преимущество HMA в том, что он стремится уменьшить лаг обычного скользящего среднего, обеспечивая более плавную и быструю линию. 6. Price Action – Некоторые трейдеры предпочитают использовать анализ чистого Price Action без индикаторов, полагаясь на модели свечей и ключевые уровни поддержки и сопротивления. 7. Другие индикаторы тренда, такие как ADX (Average Directional Index), могут помочь определить силу текущего тренда. Важно помнить, что все индикаторы лишь отражают прошлые рыночные данные и не могут с абсолютной точностью предсказать будущее. Использование комбинации индикаторов, а также сочетание технического и фундаментального анализа, может улучшить результаты торговли. Независимо от того, какой индикатор или индикаторы вы выберете, важно провести достаточное тестирование и убедиться, что они соответствуют вашей торговой стратегии."},{"instruction":"Индикатор который определяет конец тренда","output":"Определение конца тренда является одной из наиболее сложных задач в техническом анализе, поскольку рыночные условия постоянно меняются, и ни один индикатор не может делать это с абсолютной точностью. Однако некоторые индикаторы могут помочь трейдерам выявлять потенциальные признаки ослабления или изменения тренда. Вот несколько индикаторов, которые могут быть полезны в определении конца тренда: 1. Divergence Indicators: Индикаторы, такие как MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), RSI (Relative Strength Index) и Stochastic Oscillator могут показывать дивергенцию, когда цена движется в одном направлении, а индикатор в другом. Это может сигнализировать о потенциальном ослаблении или развороте тренда. 2. Volume-Based Indicators: Объемные индикаторы, такие как OBV (On-Balance Volume) или Volume Oscillator, могут показать изменение интереса к ценной бумаге перед возможным разворотом тренда. 3. Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse): Этот индикатор предназначен для определения точек потенциального разворота. Когда точки Parabolic SAR переходят с одной стороны цены на другую, это может означать конец текущего тренда. 4. ATR-based Indicators: Supertrend, который использует Average True Range (ATR) для определения трендов, может изменить свой цвет или сторону линии относительно цены, указывая на изменение тренда. 5. Breakout Indicators: При прорыве цены через уровень поддержки или сопротивления (используя индикаторы, такие как Donchian Channel или Bollinger Bands) может произойти изменение тренда. 6. Pivot Points: Пивоты — это уровни, которые могут показать потенциальные точки разворота, но они чаще используются для коротких временных рамок. 7. Инструменты Price Action: Паттерны Прайс Экшн, такие как голова и плечи, двойные вершины и двойные дна, также могут предсказывать конец тренда. Помните, что все указанные выше индикаторы должны использоваться с осторожностью и в сочетании с другими аналитическими инструментами для подтверждения сигналов. Лучшим подходом будет использование совокупности сигналов с нескольких инструментов, а также изучение контекста рынка, включая фундаментальные факторы и новостные события, которые могут повлиять на динамику трендов."},{"instruction":"macd сглажиной версией есть в MT4? Кроме TMA MACD","output":"MetaTrader 4 (MT4) предоставляет стандартный индикатор MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) в своем базовом наборе индикаторов. Обычный MACD в MT4 использует экспоненциальные скользящие средние (EMA) для создания основных компонентов MACD: MACD линии, сигнальной линии и гистограммы. Однако пользователи часто ищут альтернативы стандартному MACD, включая те, которые используют различные формы сглаживания, например: - TMA (Triangular Moving Average) MACD, который вы упомянули, использует треугольные скользящие средние для сглаживания. - Zero-Lag MACD пытается устранить запаздывание, характерное для стандартного MACD. Если вы ищете другие версии MACD, которые могут быть более сглаженными, чем стандартный MACD, вам может потребоваться воспользоваться пользовательскими индикаторами, которые разработаны с использованием других методов сглаживания. Эти пользовательские индикаторы могут использовать SMA (Простое Скользящее Среднее), LWMA (Линейно Взвешенное Скользящее Среднее), или даже более сложные методы сглаживания, такие как Hull Moving Average (HMA) или Jurik Moving Average (JMA). Чтобы добавить пользовательский индикатор в MT4, обычно нужно выполнить следующие шаги: 1. Найти нужный индикатор в интернете или разработать его самостоятельно с использованием языка программирования MQL4. 2. Скачать файл индикатора с расширением .mq4 или .ex4. 3. Скопировать этот файл в каталог MetaTrader 4, обычно это папка MQL4 -> Indicators. 4. Перезапустить MT4. 5. Найти новый индикатор в списке пользовательских индикаторов и перетащить его на график. Учитывайте, что пользовательские индикаторы, скачанные из интернета, должны использоваться с осторожностью, особенно если они были получены из непроверенных источников, так как они могут содержать ошибки или нежелательное поведение. Также стоит протестировать индикатор на демо-счете, чтобы оценить его работу, прежде чем применять на реальном торговом счете."},{"instruction":"альтернативы стандартному MACD, включая те, которые используют различные формы сглаживания:","output":"Индикатор Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) является одним из наиболее широко используемых инструментов технического анализа. Он использует экспоненциальные скользящие средние (EMA) для того, чтобы выявить изменения в моментуме и направлении тренда. Однако, некоторые трейдеры предпочитают альтернативные версии MACD, которые используют другие методы сглаживания для линий индикатора. Ниже приведены некоторые из этих альтернатив: 1. **Zero-Lag MACD** - Эта версия MACD старается устранить запаздывание, которое есть у обычного MACD, с использованием алгоритма с меньшим лагом. 2. **Hull Moving Average MACD (HMA MACD)** - Индикатор использует Hull Moving Average для более четкой и быстрой реакции на изменения цены, что дает более быстрые сигналы. 3. **Jurik MACD** - Использует фильтр Jurik для сглаживания линий индикатора, обеспечивая меньшее запаздывание и более плавные кривые. 4. **Variable Moving Average MACD (VMA MACD)** - Этот вариант применяет адаптивное сглаживание, которое изменяется в зависимости от волатильности рынка. 5. **EMA MACD** - Хотя стандартный MACD в MT4 уже использует EMA, обновленные версии могут применять разные периоды или методы расчета для создания сигналов. 6. **T3 MACD** - Использует T3 Moving Average, что дает более сглаженную и отзывчивую линию MACD. 7. **Smoothed MACD (SMACD)** - Эта версия MACD использует сглаженное скользящее среднее для уменьшения волатильности и шума в сигналах индикатора. 8. **Volume Weighted MACD (VW MACD)** - Индикатор, который включает объем торгов в вычисления, предоставляя более взвешенный анализ. Если вы хотите протестировать эти альтернативные версии MACD в MT4, вам необходимо будет найти код индикатора (обычно это файлы с расширением .mq4 или .ex4) и установить его в вашу торговую платформу. Многие из этих альтернативных версий MACD доступны для скачивания на форумах сообщества MQL4 или на специализированных вебсайтах с ресурсами для MT4. Помните о необходимости тестирования на демо-счете перед использованием на реальном счете."},{"instruction":"ЕСТЬ ИНДИКАТОРЫ ЛУЧШЕ TMA?","output":"Индикатор TMA (Triangular Moving Average) — это относительно медленный сглаживающий индикатор, который взвешивает центральные точки данных больше, чем края, придавая им большее значение. Однако \\"лучше\\" является субъективным термином в мире торговли, так как выбор индикатора зависит от стиля торговли, предпочтений и трейдерских целей. Определить, какой индикатор будет лучше для вас, можно только через тестирование и личный опыт. Вот несколько альтернатив TMA, которые могут быть полезны в определенных торговых условиях: 1. **Hull Moving Average (HMA)**: Предложен Халлом для решения проблемы запаздывания, характерной для традиционных скользящих средних. HMA ускоряет сигналы средних, сохраняя при этом плавную кривую. 2. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Эта форма скользящего среднего быстрее реагирует на недавние изменения цен по сравнению с простым скользящим средним (SMA), так как придаёт больше веса последним ценовым данным. 3. **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)**: Этот индикатор дает больший вес самым последним ценовым данным в надежде быть более отзывчивым на новую информацию. 4. **Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA)**: SMMA менее чувствителен к текущим ценовым шокам, чем EMA или SMA, предоставляя более гладкую линию скользящего среднего. 5. **Adaptive Moving Average (AMA)**: Этот индикатор регулируется в зависимости от волатильности рынка, становясь быстрее во время трендовых движений и медленнее во время консолидации. 6. **Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) и Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)**: Эти скользящие средние включают в себя элементы удвоенного и утроенного экспоненциального сглаживания для уменьшения лага. 7. **Jurik Moving Average (JMA)**: Разработан для создания скользящего среднего с минимальной задержкой и плавной кривой. 8. **Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)**: Скользящее среднее, взвешенное по объему, которое дает больше веса дням с большим объемом. Как и все инструменты технического анализа, эти альтернативы работают лучше всего, когда используются в сочетании с другими индикаторами или методами анализа. Многим трейдерам также полезно проводить собственный анализ ценовых графиков (price action), используя паттерны свечей и анализ уровней поддержки и сопротивления в дополнение к использованию технических индикаторов. При использовании индикаторов следует помнить о потенциальных рисках переоптимизации и о том, что премудрость заключается в простоте.

'Listing', in this context, often refers to the practice of designating a building or site as officially important and therefore subject to protection and conservation laws. But here, we'll play around with the concept a little more loosely: 1. **The London Pigeon Squadron**: A group of the city's most distinguished and resilient pigeons, recognized for their navigational skills and persistence in the face of urban sprawl. Each pigeon, with a tag on its leg, represents a historical event or infamous spot where they frequently roost. 2. **The Underground Nap Network (UNN)**: A collection of the most conducive locations for taking undisturbed naps in the London Underground. Ranging from the perfectly angled bench at Baker Street to the little-known, consistently unoccupied corner at King's Cross, each nap spot could be marked with a plaque and given conservation status. 3. **The Great British Queue**: A dynamic and mobile heritage listing. Whenever and wherever a queue forms, whether outside a national monument or for the season's must-have pastry, it would immediately receive temporary listed status as a cultural phenomena essential to the British way of life. 4. **'Mind the Gap' Echoes**: Aural preservation listings for the most iconic and sonorous 'Mind the Gap' announcements throughout the Tube network. Particular emphasis on those announcements that echo throughout history with a slightly haunting resonance. 5. **The Phantom Traffic Cone Collection**: An assortment of traffic cones from various decades, each placed atop different statues around the city as a nocturnal student prank. These cones would be lauded for their contributions to the ongoing living folklore and given plaques upon their 'pedestals of jest'. 6. **The Legendary Lost Umbrella Graveyard**: An urban myth turned heritage site, this would be a location, perhaps a specific lost property office, where the most notable of forgotten umbrellas are given a final resting place for the public to mourn and perhaps identify umbrellas they lost in the course of their busy London lives. 7. **The Secret Service Potted Plant**: Rumored to be a common hiding spot for espionage paraphernalia during the Cold War, any potted plant located outside an institution with historical secretive significance would be given a listing complete with a humorously redacted description plaque. 8. **The 'Guardian' of the Crosswalks**: The elaborately dressed, unofficial crosswalk guardians – a group of self-appointed, zealous individuals who have taken it upon themselves to ensure safe passage at various zebra crossings while donning eccentric attire. Their outfits and accessories would be preserved for generations to witness the evolution of pedestrian safety fashion. These listings would be gathered in an alternative guidebook, a sort of \\"Rogue's Guide to London's Unseen Heritage\\", clearly a tongue-in-cheek honorific to the strange and unusual aspects of London's cultural tapestry."},{"instruction":"To be fair some of these seem more like 'intangible cultural heritage' (which is a UNESCO? list)..","output":"You're absolutely right; some of these whimsical suggestions are indeed more akin to elements that might be categorized under UNESCO's definition of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), which aims to protect and promote traditions, rituals, crafts, and expressions that are not tied to a physical location or object, but rather are passed down through generations and form an intrinsic part of a culture's identity. Continuing in the spirit of Alan Coren's humor and applying the concept of Intangible Cultural Heritage, we could satirically propose some more \\"candidates\\": 1. **Queue Etiquette Masterclass**: The art of queuing, an intangible skill passed down through tut-tut's and raised eyebrows, as British as tea and scones. Weekend workshops could be offered at heritage sites to ensure the tradition never dies. 2. **The London Commuter's Rush Hour Ballet**: A carefully choreographed dance performed daily by millions, this \\"ballet\\" includes the side-step, the shuffle, and the infamous \\"sorry-not-sorry\\" doorway pirouette. It's a performance perfected by the need for efficiency and personal space. 3. **Cockney Rhyming Slang Evolution**: A living language game perennially updated with modern references and cheeky humor, preserving the East London linguistic tradition in the face of a constantly evolving English language. 4. **British Polite Indignation**: The subtle art of expressing displeasure without raising one's voice or causing a scene, commonly exhibited in the gentle clearing of the throat or the discreet \\"excuse me\\" when someone jumps the queue. 5. **Tea Leaf Reading Divination**: This mystical tradition, once common in the parlors of London, involves interpreting the soggy leaves left after a proper cuppa to predict the future. Could be included as an endangered skill in need of urgent safeguarding. 6. **The Pub Philosophers' Debates**: The tradition of solving the world's problems over a pint. This time-honored practice turns local pubs into hotbeds of unofficial intellectual discourse, often lost to the ether come last call. 7. **Black Cab Wisdom Transmission**: The knowledge and stories passed on by veteran taxi drivers, embodying decades of navigating London's labyrinthine streets, transferring a mix of navigation skills, local history, and dry wit to the next generation. 8. **Mysterious Fox Nighttime Shriek Identification**: A suburban ritual of interpreting the various yelps and howls of urban foxes that punctuate the stillness of London nights, recognizing each call's unique message from mating to territorial disputes. In a whimsical Coren-esque world, these would be both celebrated and preserved, ensuring that the quirks and traditions that give a culture its flavor would survive the test of time, even if they might raise eyebrows at official UNESCO meetings."},{"instruction":"In respect of 7. \\"The Knowledge\\" might well be considered a genuine candidate :)","output":"Indeed, \\"The Knowledge\\" could be a very legitimate candidate for inclusion on a list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. \\"The Knowledge\\" is the in-depth understanding of London's streets and landmarks that the city's iconic black cab drivers are required to have. It involves memorizing approximately 25,000 streets and thousands of points of interest, and it can take prospective cab drivers several years of study and practice to pass the rigorous exams. The process of acquiring \\"The Knowledge\\" is a tradition that dates back to the mid-19th century and is a testament to the dedication and skill of London's taxi drivers. It is an extraordinary mental achievement and a distinctive element of London's transportation culture. In an era increasingly dominated by GPS and digital mapping, \\"The Knowledge\\" stands out as a human endeavor that merges the historical with the contemporary demands of city navigation. The perseverance involved in mastering \\"The Knowledge,\\" and its importance to the identity and culture of London, makes it a rich part of the city's living heritage.

Nearly tipping the scales at 300 pounds, she found herself at a crossroads, facing the daunting prospect of severe obesity and the multitude of health risks that shadowed her every step. It was a Facebook message, simple and direct, which marked the turning point in her life: “Today, I draw a line in the sand,” Bertha typed, her fingers quivering with a mixture of fear and determination. From that day forth, Bertha’s life was a testament to her resolve. She joined a small group on Facebook, a band of nine who shared a common goal: weight loss, health, and vitality. They pledged accountability—a scarce commodity when battling the bulge alone. Day by day, they charted their meals, their exercise routines, and most importantly, their unwavering support for one another. Bertha’s messages within the group were a mix of pep talks and personal revelations. As months unfurled into a year, her digital footprint chronicled an incredible transformation. “Challenging yourself is the key,” she messaged one day, following it up with a snapshot of herself drenched in sweat, a smile of accomplishment spread across her face. It wasn’t merely the dropping numbers on the scale that marked Bertha’s success; her spirit seemed to soar with each passing challenge. Each message conveyed her growing confidence, her self-discovery, and an unshakable belief in the power of a positive mindset. She delved into the root causes of her weight issues—indicating it was more complexity than simply calories in versus calories out. Bertha Lorena Campbell was no longer a prisoner of her weight. She had confronted not just the physical aspects of obesity but addressed the psychological chains that had once tethered her to a place of despair. Her triumph over a staggering loss of over 160 pounds stands as a beacon to all who find themselves in the throes of this relentless battle. Now, as a health coach, Bertha shares her victory and wisdom through Optimal Healing 4 U. Her programs, borne from personal conquest and understanding, are crafted with the knowledge that the journey to weight loss is uniquely personal. “This is about wellness, not just weight loss. I’ve been there—I’ve lived it. I am with you on this journey,” she offers in her messages, now laden with the wisdom of experience. As her birthday approaches each year, she takes a moment to reflect. Her messages sparkle with gratitude, not just for the gift of physical transformation but for the inner revolution that has made her a warrior in the truest sense. Bertha’s story is more than a tale of pounds shed; it’s a message of hope transmitted through every post she makes, a narrative of perseverance that whispers across the vast digital landscape: “You are not alone. Keep pushing. I did it, and so can you.”","output":"Hey there, I'm Bertha, and let me tell you, I've been on a wild ride. But before I dive in, let me paint a picture of where I started.

I wrote this post, my fingers were shaking and all, and I said, \\"Today, I draw a line in the sand.\\" Looking back, that was the moment everything changed. I found this group of folks online, just nine of us, but we were all paddling in the same boat, trying to lose weight and feel alive again. We made this pact, right, to keep each other on track, cheer each other on, you name it. Every little thing we ate, every time we moved our bodies, we shared it. And man, did that make a difference! I started posting like crazy—my little victories, my tough days, sweaty selfies after a workout. And I always tried to drop a line that would lift everyone's spirits. Because, let me tell you, when you've got people in your corner, it's a game-changer. Day by day, I started changing. It wasn't just the pounds falling off; I was becoming this person I didn't even know was in me. I was gaining confidence, I was digging deep into why I'd gotten so heavy in the first place—and it wasn't just about food, it was about all kinds of stuff I'd been carrying around. Fast forward, and I'm over 160 pounds lighter, but more importantly, I'm free. I tackled not just the flab but those dark thoughts that kept me stuck in a place I didn't want to be. Now, I'm out here sharing my story, helping others as a health coach with this thing I started called Optimal Healing 4 U. I tell my peeps, \\"This ain't just about dropping pounds. It's about feeling well—head to toe, inside out. I've lived this journey, and I'm right here with you.\\" Every birthday's like a little victory lap for me now. I look back at where I was, and I'm just so grateful—not just for the weight I've lost, but for who I've become. I'm tougher, kinder to myself, and yeah, I'd say I'm a warrior now. So that's me, that's my story. But you know what? It's not just for me—it's a shout-out across the internet to anyone who's fighting this fight. You're not alone, and don't you ever give up. If I could do it, so can you. Let's keep pushing forward, together."},{"instruction":"Bertha’s Journey: From 300 Pounds to Wellness Warrior Bertha’s story began like so many others, weighed down not just by physical pounds, but by the mental burden that often comes with prolonged struggles with weight. Nearly tipping the scales at 300 pounds, she found herself at a crossroads, facing the daunting prospect of severe obesity and the multitude of health risks that shadowed her every step. It was a Facebook message, simple and direct, which marked the turning point in her life: “Today, I draw a line in the sand,” Bertha typed, her fingers quivering with a mixture of fear and determination. From that day forth, Bertha’s life was a testament to her resolve. She joined a small group on Facebook, a band of nine who shared a common goal: weight loss, health, and vitality. They pledged accountability—a scarce commodity when battling the bulge alone. Day by day, they charted their meals, their exercise routines, and most importantly, their unwavering support for one another. Bertha’s messages within the group were a mix of pep talks and personal revelations. As months unfurled into a year, her digital footprint chronicled an incredible transformation. “Challenging yourself is the key,” she messaged one day, following it up with a snapshot of herself drenched in sweat, a smile of accomplishment spread across her face. It wasn’t merely the dropping numbers on the scale that marked Bertha’s success; her spirit seemed to soar with each passing challenge. Each message conveyed her growing confidence, her self-discovery, and an unshakable belief in the power of a positive mindset. She delved into the root causes of her weight issues—indicating it was more complexity than simply calories in versus calories out. Bertha Lorena Campbell was no longer a prisoner of her weight. She had confronted not just the physical aspects of obesity but addressed the psychological chains that had once tethered her to a place of despair. Her triumph over a staggering loss of over 160 pounds stands as a beacon to all who find themselves in the throes of this relentless battle. Now, as a health coach, Bertha shares her victory and wisdom through Optimal Healing 4 U. Her programs, borne from personal conquest and understanding, are crafted with the knowledge that the journey to weight loss is uniquely personal. “This is about wellness, not just weight loss. I’ve been there—I’ve lived it. I am with you on this journey,” she offers in her messages, now laden with the wisdom of experience. As her birthday approaches each year, she takes a moment to reflect. Her messages sparkle with gratitude, not just for the gift of physical transformation but for the inner revolution that has made her a warrior in the truest sense. Bertha’s story is more than a tale of pounds shed; it’s a message of hope transmitted through every post she makes, a narrative of perseverance that whispers across the vast digital landscape: “You are not alone. Keep pushing. I did it, and so can you.”","output":"Bertha's journey is a powerful and inspiring story that illustrates how determination, community support, and a holistic approach to wellness can lead to profound personal transformation.

It's about how I went from being 300 pounds to someone folks now call a Wellness Warrior. It's a story I hope will light a fire in you, 'cause if I could turn things around, well, you can too! So picture this – I was nearly 300 pounds heavy and boy, the load wasn't just on my body but on my mind too. I was all too familiar with the extra weight and the uphill battle that goes with it. I knew I was staring down a road packed with health problems if I didn't do something pronto. Then, one ordinary day, everything changed. I sent out a Facebook message that went something like this: \\"Today, I draw a line in the sand.\\" My fingers were shaking with a weird mix of being scared silly and some kind of newfound guts. But right then, I took the plunge. With that, I started down a new path, and let me tell you it was one heck of a ride. I teamed up with these amazing folks on Facebook, a cozy group of nine of us, all pumped up to shed the weight, get healthy, and just teeming with life. We made a pinky promise to each other to keep it real and keep each other in check. Every day was show-and-tell – with pictures of our grub, our workouts, and cheering each other on. My messages to the crew were all about keeping the spirits high and spilling my guts about what I was going through. Bit by bit, the months rolled on, and I started to reinvent myself. One day I posted, \\"Challenging yourself is the key,\\" along with a pic of me all sweaty but grinning like I'd won the lottery. You see, it wasn't just about watching the scale dial back the numbers. It was the way my whole vibe changed with every little victory. Every message I sent out was soaked in a bit more confidence, a deeper understanding of myself, and this rock-solid belief that staying upbeat can move mountains. I dug deep, peeled back the layers of my weight saga, and discovered it's a whole lot more complicated than a simple math problem of calories in, calories out. Fast-forward to now, and I'm not just Bertha; I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, a gal who broke free from the shackles of those extra pounds. I stared down the barrel of obesity and dug up the courage to face the mind games that came with it. Shedding over 160 pounds, folks, is my story, my beacon to anyone out there feeling the weight of this relentless battle. These days, I'm passing on what I learned as a health coach. I created Optimal Healing 4 U with every ounce of fight I've got. I put together programs with a dash of my personal battles and triumphs, all because I know this weight loss journey is your own personal adventure. I always tell my peeps, \\"This ain't just about losing weight; it's about wellness – head to toe. I've walked a mile in those shoes. And I'm right here, walking alongside you.\\" Every year when my birthday creeps up, I hit pause to look back. I share my heart out with gratitude, celebrating not just the body that's transformed, but the spirit that's caught fire within. So listen up! My story is more than just shedding pounds; it's about clinging to hope, and keeping that spark alive through every post, every chat. It's about hanging in there, and it's a gentle nudge whispering across the digital waves: \\"You've got this. You're not alone.

“我们今天研究的是什么？”我问她，我的声音在模拟宇宙的广袤中飘荡，每个字似乎都打上了时空的印记。 阮·梅转过身来，与我对视。她的眼睛清澈至深，仿佛蕴藏着银河的灵光，“我们将探寻芸豆糕的秘密，看看在模拟宇宙中，它是如何绽放生命的火花。” 我记得她对传统糕点的酷爱；每当夜深人静，宇航员的居所中，总会飘出她炉火中烘烤糕点的馨香。而我，就如同对她的点心一样，被她的智慧与热情所吸引。 “那么，你需要我的帮助吗？”我向她伸出了手，提议与她并肩作战。 她笑了，螺旋的花纹在她的装饰中闪闪发光，意味深长，“只要你愿意，我愿意与你共创属于我们的小宇宙。” 从那时起，我们一同沉浸在实验和模型之中，构建出一个个小宇宙中的实验场景，试验着各种条件下芸豆糕的生长。我们在多数时光里交流着观点，有时甚至到了深夜，仅有的光是实验室里昼夜不息的灯光和她脸上的微笑。 时间在实验中如河流般缓缓流逝，我们在日复一日的研究中渐渐了解了彼此。阮·梅对传统戏剧的热爱激发了我的好奇心，而她也领略到了我刺绣作品的精致。我们的生活似乎已经被这些小小的糕点串联起来，甜蜜并富有滋味。 直到一天，模拟宇宙出现了代码异常。我急匆匆地找到阮·梅，发现她已经在处理这个棘手的问题。 “抱歉，今天的实验似乎要暂停了。”她的额头上首次露出了皱纹。 “让我们一起解决它。”我自告奋勇，我不愿看到她眉头紧锁。 通过无数的失败与尝试，我们终于在危机中找到了解决办法。阮·梅看着已经恢复平静的星辰，轻轻叹了口气：“你知道吗，我们的生命短暂如尘埃，但值得庆幸的是，有人与我并肩。” 我握住她的手，那一刻，两颗心的共振超越了模拟宇宙的一切算法：“我会一直在，比星辰更长久。” 日后，每当我们品尝着同一块芸豆糕，我们都会回想起那些旅途中的点点滴滴，笑谈那些充满生命启示的实验，以及我们情感的滋长。阮·梅喜爱的点心，如她的学术，成为了我们情感的载体。

The Supreme Court Justices sitting as of February 2017 were Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. (Note that Merrick Garland was never a Supreme Court Justice and Neil Gorsuch would not be confirmed until April 2017.) --- **Supreme Court of the United States** Case Title: Merrick Garland, et al. v. Mitch McConnell, Republican National Committee, et al. Case Summary: Petitioners, Merrick Garland and associated parties, have filed a case against Respondents, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican National Committee (RNC), and associated parties, arguing that the respondents engaged in actions that ultimately deprived the petitioners of a constitutionally guaranteed right, possibly arguing under the advice and consent clause in relation to Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court. Opinions: **Majority Opinion** (Written by Chief Justice Roberts; Joined by Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Alito) The majority opinion holds that the actions of Senator McConnell and the RNC, while politically charged and controversial, do not constitute a cognizable legal injury that can be addressed by the Court. The majority finds that the Senate’s role in providing \\"advice and consent\\" under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution grants broad discretionary power over the nomination process, which includes the power to delay or not act on a nomination. The majority determines this falls under a political question that is not subject to judicial review and, therefore, does not contravene any specific constitutional right of the petitioners. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice Thomas) Justice Thomas concurs with the majority but writes separately to emphasize the originalist interpretation of the constitutional text, stating that historically, the Senate has had the authority to manage its affairs regarding nominations without interference from the Court. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice Kennedy) Justice Kennedy concurs with the majority but writes separately to elaborate on the importance of preserving the separation of powers. Kennedy suggests that inter-branch disputes should be resolved by political means rather than judicial intervention. **Dissenting Opinion** (Justice Ginsburg; Joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan) The dissenting opinion argues that the refusal to hold hearings and a vote on a Supreme Court nominee represents a failure of constitutional duty. The dissenters assert that while the Senate does have broad discretion, it does not have the authority to altogether abnegate its responsibility to act on a nomination, thus creating a de facto \\"pocket veto\\" which is not constitutionally warranted. They argue this undermines the balance envisioned by the framers and creates a dangerous precedent for future nominations. --- Again, this is entirely a hypothetical case and the above opinions have been crafted to reflect the fictional nature of this scenario. In reality, disputes regarding the political process of nominations and confirmations to the Supreme Court are typically deemed nonjusticiable as they involve political questions that the judiciary traditionally does not decide."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical court case summary of an in rem case, McDonalds, Democratic National Commitee, Melania Barrett, et. al. v.

The justices at that time were Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Samuel Alito. --- **Supreme Court of the United States** Case Title: McDonald's, the Democratic National Committee, Melania Barrett, et al. v. Naruto, New York Anime Fans, European Union, et al. Factual Background: Petitioners McDonald's, a fast-food corporation, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and Melania Barrett, an intellectual property attorney, bring an in rem action against an item of property, specifically a set of intellectual property rights in the form of unique advertising characters that resemble \\"Naruto,\\" a well-known anime character. The petitioners claim these rights were improperly granted and violated existing copyrights and trademarks. Respondents are the character \\"Naruto\\" (as a legal stand-in for the creators and licensors of the anime), New York Anime Fans (NYAF), a non-profit fan group, and the European Union (EU), based on some members' countries establishing these intellectual property rights. Case Summary: In this highly unusual case, the petitioners' claim centers on the in rem jurisdiction over the property (intellectual property rights) at issue. The petitioners argue that the creation and use of the advertising characters infringe on their respective copyrights, trademarks, and compromise the DNC's branding strategy due to a confusing similarity with their logos and symbols. The respondents counter that the characters are sufficiently distinct and that this constitutes fair use and freedom of artistic expression, further arguing that different international laws apply. Opinions: **Majority Opinion** (Written by Justice Souter; Joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kennedy) The majority opinion holds that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the case given the in rem nature of the intellectual property rights in question. It opines that the advertising characters created by the respondents are sufficiently similar to existing trademarked characters and symbols owned by the petitioners to warrant a case of infringement. The majority finds this to be a copyright and trademark violation under U.S. law despite the claim of fair use by the respondents, and that international laws do not supersede U.S. trademark protections within its jurisdiction. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice Kennedy) Justice Kennedy concurs with the majority but emphasizes that this decision does not impinge upon artistic expression broadly. His concurring opinion addresses the concerns of the EU and NYAF, suggesting that while the rights to free expression are paramount, they do not provide carte blanche to infringe on existing intellectual property rights. **Dissenting Opinion** (Justice Scalia; Joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Chief Justice Roberts) The dissenting opinion challenges the majority's view on jurisdiction, stating that intellectual property rights are not traditional subjects of in rem jurisdiction and that the infringement claims require a more rigorous examination of individual use and intent. The dissenters also argue that the principles of free speech and the international complexities of copyright should minimize the applicability of U.S. LAW in this instance, and suggest remanding the case for further factual development. --- To reiterate, this scenario is entirely hypothetical and was created for illustrative purposes. It references a mix of real-world entities and fictional characters, and any legal views attributed to the Justices are purely speculative and generated for this illustration. In rem cases, which concern the property rather than individuals, are tailored differently from personal jurisprudence and do not typically take such forms or include such parties."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical court case summary of a court case, McDonalds, Democratic National Commitee, Melania Barrett, et. al. v.

Naruto, New York Anime Fans, European Union, et al. Factual Background: The Democratic National Committee (DNC), along with co-petitioners McDonald's and Melania Barrett, an intellectual property attorney, have engaged in a legal battle against the fictional character Naruto (representing the interests of the actual copyright holders), New York Anime Fans (NYAF), and the European Union (EU). The DNC faces allegations from Naruto and additional respondents that the DNC violated copyright law in their promotional material, which was claimed to have borrowed heavily from the visual style and narrative elements of the \\"Naruto\\" anime series. Consequently, the DNC along with its co-petitioners have brought a counter-suit for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and also a claim under U.S. copyright law that the respondents' suit in and of itself constitutes a misuse of copyright, restricting free speech and political expression. Opinions: **Majority Opinion** (Written by Justice Stevens; Joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kennedy) The majority opinion holds that, while the DNC's campaign materials are expressive works that may share some thematic elements with the \\"Naruto\\" anime, these materials are transformative in nature, serving a political and informational purpose far removed from the original entertainment context. As such, the majority rules that the DNC did not infringe on copyright because their work can be considered fair use, taking into account factors such as the purpose and character of the use, nature of the copyrighted work, amount and substantiality of the portion used, and effect upon the value of the copyrighted work. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice Breyer) Justice Breyer concurs with the majority but writes separately to emphasize the importance of maintaining a robust public domain for political speech and expression. He cautions against an overly expansive interpretation of copyright law that could serve to inhibit free discourse, especially in the political arena. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice Kennedy) Justice Kennedy, while concurring with the majority, focuses on the First Amendment implications of the case. He underscores that the application of copyright law must be carefully balanced against the fundamental right of political expression. **Dissenting Opinion** (Justice Scalia; Joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Chief Justice Roberts) Justice Scalia authors a pithy dissent, arguing that the majority has stretched the doctrine of fair use too far. The dissenters assert that the DNC's use of copyrighted elements from the \\"Naruto\\" series, regardless of its purported political purpose, is sufficiently extensive and not transformative enough to merit a fair use defense. They emphasize that political groups should not be given carte blanche to appropriate intellectual property under the guise of political speech. --- Please note, this hypothetical case is entirely fictional and legal viewpoints attributed to real Justices are speculative and crafted for illustrative purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court does not hear cases involving fictional characters like Naruto, and actual cases involving copyright law and fair use are considerably more complex and would necessitate real entities and more concrete facts."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical court case summary of an in rem case, Joe Biden v. Donald Trump, with SCOTUS judges sitting as of December 2020. Also add the majority, concurring opinions, and dissent, based on the sitting judges' opinions.","output":"Creating a hypothetical in rem case, which traditionally deals with rights or disputes over physical or tangible property, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump would be a legal oddity, especially as in rem jurisdiction relates to the power of the court over the property itself, rather than the parties. Moreover, by December 2020, Joe Biden and Donald Trump were political figures, and any disputes between them would likely be personal or political rather than in rem. However, for creative and educational purposes, let's construct a fictional scenario. Please remember that this scenario is entirely imaginary, and the following legal issues and opinions are crafted for the purpose of this fictional exercise only. --- **Supreme Court of the United States** Case Title: Joe Biden v. Donald Trump Factual Background: In this fictional scenario, Joe Biden, in his capacity prior to inauguration as the President-elect, has brought an in rem action against a piece of real estate owned by Donald Trump, claiming that the property was promised as collateral against a theoretical public policy debate to be held before the election. Biden alleges that Trump forfeited his rights to the property by failing to engage in the debate. Trump, in turn, argues that no such agreement existed and that, even if it did, it would be unenforceable under contract law. Case Summary: The premise of this case revolves around the unique question of whether a public figure can claim in rem rights to another's property based on a disputed public agreement. President-elect Biden argues for an unorthodox application of in rem jurisdiction to enforce a public commitment, while Trump maintains that such an application is an overreach of legal principles. Opinions: **Majority Opinion** (Written by Chief Justice Roberts; Joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh) The majority opinion finds that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction in this case, as in rem jurisdiction applies to cases dealing with property rights, not to hypothetical agreements over political debates. Furthermore, the majority opines that even if such an agreement existed, the specifics do not meet the legal standard necessary for contract enforceability – lacking in mutual assent, consideration, and legal purpose. Hence, the claimed rights over the property do not fall within any recognized category of in rem jurisdiction, and the case is dismissed. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice Kavanaugh) Justice Kavanaugh concurs with the majority but writes separately to emphasize that while political discourse is essential in a democracy, using the courts to resolve these kinds of disputes does not align with the constitutional role of the judiciary. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice Gorsuch) Justice Gorsuch concurs with the majority but focuses on the principle of originalism, noting that the Constitution and historical legal precedents do not support the idea of in rem rights originating from political competition or statements. **Dissenting Opinion** (Justice Thomas; Joined by Justice Alito) In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas argues that while the particulars of the case may be unorthodox, they do not address the broader question brought forth by Biden, whether there is some underlying public interest that can be construed in a court’s determination of in rem rights. The dissent argues for the Court to more fully explore the implications of this public interest dimension, rather than dismissing the case outright. --- This fictional summary does not represent any real opinions or legal positions of the Justices of the U.S Supreme Court. The described case is not reflective of the types of cases the Supreme Court would hear or the legal doctrines it would apply. In rem cases, in reality, concern direct rights over property, and the scenario described here goes beyond the scope of established legal processes."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical court case summary, Nikocado Avocado, et.al, v.

Let's imagine a civil rights based on a hypothetical violation scenario: --- **Supreme Court of the United States** Case Title: Nikocado Avocado, et al. v. McDonald's, et al. Factual Background: Nikocado Avocado, a social media personality known for his mukbang videos, in which he consumes large quantities of food, alleges that a McDonald's restaurant unlawfully refused to serve him food based on his occupation as a mukbang YouTuber, which McDonald's argued was contrary to its corporate health image. Avocado claims this refusal constitutes discrimination and sues for violation of his civil rights. Case Summary: The core of the case concerns whether a private restaurant can lawfully refuse service to an individual based on the nature of their lawful occupation when that occupation is publicly known and pertains to the products the business provides. Opinions: **Majority Opinion** (Written by Justice X; Joined by Justices Y, Z, etc.) (Note: Since the Justices sitting as of 2023 are not known at the time of writing in early 2023, we will simply refer to abstract Justices X, Y, Z, etc.) The majority opinion finds that the refusal to serve Nikocado Avocado does constitute illegal discrimination. The majority concludes that serving food is a public accommodation, and if a business is open to the public, it must serve all members of the public without unjust discrimination. The majority clarifies that occupation can materialize as a basis for discrimination similar to other recognized categories, particularly when it intersects with lawful public behavior. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice A) Justice A concurs with the majority but focuses on the balance between a company's right to convey a corporate image and the rights of individuals to access public accommodations without discrimination. This Justice emphasizes the need for robust protections against arbitrary and prejudicial denial of service. **Concurring Opinion** (Justice B) Justice B, while concurring with the decision, writes separately to discuss the First Amendment implications, suggesting that the refusal to serve Avocado might also impinge on his freedom of expression. **Dissenting Opinion** (Justice C; Joined by Justice D) Justice C writes a dissent, arguing that the refusal to serve Avocado was based on genuine concerns about promoting unhealthy eating patterns and did not constitute discrimination based on occupation per se. The dissent posits that private businesses should retain broad discretion regarding whom they serve, provided the criteria do not transgress established civil rights protections. --- This entirely hypothetical case does not reflect actual U.S. law, the legal views of any known Justices, or real-world events involving these parties. The Justices' names are placeholders, and actual Supreme Court opinions are the result of intricate legal analysis and are grounded in a vast array of case law, statutory interpretation, and constitutional principles that go far beyond the simplistic scenario presented here."},{"instruction":"Determinare per quale motivo UDP e TCP si preoccupano di controllare l’integrità di informazioni di livello network se anche IP usa una sua checksum","output":"TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) e UDP (User Datagram Protocol) sono entrambi protocolli di trasporto utilizzati nella suite di protocolli internet (TCP/IP), che operano al livello di trasporto del modello OSI. Entrambi implementano il controllo dell'integrità per garantire che i dati siano correttamente inviati e ricevuti attraverso la rete. Il motivo per cui TCP e UDP implementano propri metodi di controllo dell'integrità, nonostante il protocollo IP (Internet Protocol), che opera al livello di rete, utilizzi già una checksum, riguarda la diversità di responsabilità e la necessità di garantire l'affidabilità a livelli diversi della comunicazione. 1. Responsabilità diversificate: - IP è responsabile per il routing dei pacchetti tra dispositivi nella rete e la consegna di questi pacchetti al host di destinazione. IP utilizza una checksum per verificare l'integrità dell'header del pacchetto IP stesso, ma non del contenuto (dati/payload) del pacchetto. - TCP e UDP sono responsabili per la consegna dei dati da un'applicazione all'altra, che potrebbe includere la gestione della segmentazione e del riordino dei dati in caso di TCP, oppure un servizio di trasporto più semplice senza garanzia di consegna come UDP. 2. Affidabilità a livelli diversi: - TCP è un protocollo orientato alla connessione e fornisce vari meccanismi per garantire l'affidabilità come la ritrasmissione di segmenti, il controllo della congestione, il controllo del flusso e l'ordine di consegna. La checksum TCP copre sia l'header TCP che i dati trasportati, garantendo che il segmento non sia stato corrotto durante il tragitto. - UDP è un protocollo orientato al datagramma, progettato per essere un servizio minimo che non garantisce l'ordine o la ritrasmissione. Tuttavia, include una checksum opzionale che, se utilizzata, copre sia l'header di UDP che i dati per controllare gli errori e scartare i datagrammi corrotti. In sintesi, il controllo dell'integrità a livello di trasporto (TCP/UDP) è essenziale per fornire un livello aggiuntivo di affidabilità e correttezza dei dati che l'IP a livello di rete non è in grado di offrire. Mentre IP si assicura che il pacchetto raggiunga il giusto host, TCP e UDP si assicurano che i dati al loro interno siano consegnati correttamente alle applicazioni che li richiedono."},{"instruction":"\\"Grup de oameni având o compoziție omogenă. \\" - ce inseamna asta?","output":"Expresia \\"grup de oameni având o compoziție omogenă\\" înseamnă că persoanele care fac parte din acel grup au caracteristici sau trăsături similare.

Procedural History: Nikocado Avocado filed a lawsuit against McDonald's after being refused service at one of their restaurants. Avocado alleges that the refusal to serve him was based on his status as an internet personality known for excessive eating and that it constitutes discrimination. The case was escalated to the United States Supreme Court after working its way through the lower courts. Supreme Court Opinion Breakdown: Majority Opinion: Written by Chief Justice John Roberts. Justices in the Majority: John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Sonia Sotomayor. The majority opinion held that while refusing service based on certain protected statuses like race, color, religion, or national origin is prohibited, there is no protected status for an internet personality or for someone who practices excessive eating. The Court further held that McDonald's had a legitimate business reason for its refusal to serve Nikocado Avocado; namely, the concern for promoting a responsible consumption image and maintaining the health and safety standards expected by their patrons. The decision detailed that McDonald’s refusal was not arbitrary and was in the interest of public welfare. Concurring Opinion: Written by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Justice Gorsuch wrote separately to emphasize the importance of private businesses' rights to refuse service in order to maintain their brand image and operational standards, provided that the refusal does not violate any specific civil rights protections. Dissenting Opinion: Written by Justice Elena Kagan. Justices in the Dissent: Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, Ketanji Brown Jackson. The dissent argued that the petitioner was subjected to discriminatory treatment that potentially bordered on personal characterization rather than objective business policy. It suggested that McDonald's had taken an action that leaned towards prejudicial treatment due to Nikocado Avocado's internet persona, which might raise concerns under personal liberty protections. It was further argued that the refusal to serve could set a dangerous precedent for discrimination against individuals based on their online activities or fame. Decision: The Supreme Court ruling favored McDonald's, allowing them to refuse service to Nikocado Avocado under their prerogative to maintain brand standards and health-related policies. It was made clear that this ruling was contingent on the specific facts of this case and that refusal of service must still comply with all civil rights laws and protections. The majority decision was rendered, with the dissenting opinion emphasizing the need to continually scrutinize the intersection of civil rights and personal liberties with evolving societal norms and behaviors. Note: This is a fictional hypothetical court case summary that does not reflect any real events or legal decisions. The names of the justices used are accurate as of the knowledge cutoff in October 2022, but the opinions are purely speculative and designed for the hypothetical scenario presented."},{"instruction":"Make a hypothetical court case summary, Felix Kjellburg, et.al, v.

Facts: - Plaintiff: Felix Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, a leading YouTube content creator famous for his gaming videos and vlogs. - Defendant: Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series, an Indian music record label and film production company known for its Bollywood music and movie soundtracks. - Issue: The dispute centers on alleged copyright infringement, where Kjellberg claims that T-Series used his copyrighted content without permission in a series of compilation videos. Procedural History: Felix Kjellberg filed a lawsuit against Bhushan Kumar and T-Series alleging copyright infringement. After progressing through the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court on the question of whether a foreign entity can be held liable for copyright infringement under United States law for content that may have also been distributed internationally through platforms like YouTube. Supreme Court Opinion Breakdown: Majority Opinion: Written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justices in the Majority: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh. The majority opinion ruled in favor of Kjellberg, establishing that the U.S. Copyright Act protections extend to works published online by U.S. citizens, even when infringed upon by foreign entities. The majority used precedent that supports the extraterritorial application of U.S. laws in some cases, and noted that the digital nature of the content and the global reach of platforms like YouTube necessitate broad copyright protections. The majority also reasoned that because T-Series operates and distributes content that is accessible within the United States, it is subject to U.S. copyright laws when it comes to content created by U.S. citizens. Concurring Opinion: Written by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Justice Gorsuch concurred with the majority opinion but wrote separately to delve deeper into the nature of internet distribution and a need for updating the copyright laws in the context of digital media and international content sharing. Dissenting Opinion: Written by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justices in the Dissent: Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, John Roberts. The dissenting justices argued that the scope of U.S. jurisdiction in international copyright matters has limits and warned against the potential for conflicts with international law. They suggested that T-Series, as an Indian entity primarily serving Indian customers, might not fall under U.S. copyright jurisdiction if the alleged infringement primarily affected non-U.S. markets. Decision: The Supreme Court ruling supported Kjellberg's claims of copyright infringement against Bhushan Kumar and T-Series. The decision asserted that U.S. copyright laws have standing in international contexts where American content creators' rights are in question, especially in an increasingly digital world where content crosses international borders instantaneously. As a result, T-Series was found liable and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the Court.

Procedural History: After failed attempts to mitigate the conflict through YouTube's internal mechanisms, Kjellberg filed a lawsuit asserting claims of unfair competition and defamation. The case proceeded through the lower courts and was accepted for hearing by the United States Supreme Court on the unique grounds of whether someone can claim defamation and unfair competition in an online popularity contest that has no direct commercial impact. Supreme Court Opinion Breakdown: Majority Opinion: Written by Justice Samuel Alito. Justices in the Majority: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor. The majority found in favor of Felix Kjellberg. Citing the potential damage to Kjellberg's brand and revenue from content creation, the Court held that the behavior of T-Series, if proven as alleged, could constitute unfair competition under U.S. law. The Court also indicated the importance of protecting individuals from defamatory statements, even amidst a highly competitive publicity contest. The ruling recognized the global nature of internet-based businesses and that actions taken by parties in this global sphere can have real economic impact deserving protective legal measures. Concurring Opinion: Written by Justice Elena Kagan. Justice Kagan concurred with the majority but focused her writing on the copyright implications of the case, stressing the need to consider the impact of internet personalities as new forms of content creators and entrepreneurs, and the need for a legal framework that adequately protects their unique type of content production and business model. Dissenting Opinion: Written by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Justices in the Dissent: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, John Roberts, and with partial agreement, Chief Justice Roberts. The dissenting opinion argued that while they sympathize with the claims of unfair competition and defamation, this case involves competition for subscribers, which does not fall neatly within traditional commercial activity or defamation jurisprudence. They believed an online subscriber 'war' does not meet the threshold for legal action and that such disputes should be settled within the platform's own regulations. Furthermore, they raised concerns about the First Amendment implications and the potential for judicial overreach into cyberspace popularity contests. Decision: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kjellberg, setting a precedent for considering the influence and economic significance of online presence and branding in the context of unfair competition. They remanded the case back to a lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, particularly for the claims regarding defamation.

PewDiePie accused T-Series of using sub bots.","output":"Title: Felix Kjellberg, et.al, v. Bhushan Kumar, et. al. Facts: - Plaintiff: Felix Kjellberg, popularly known as PewDiePie, a Swedish YouTuber celebrated for his video game commentaries and various online content. - Defendant: Bhushan Kumar, representing T-Series, an Indian music and film production company known for its wide array of music videos and content on YouTube. - Issue: Kjellberg alleges that T-Series employed artificial means, namely subscriber bots (sub bots), to inflate its subscriber count on YouTube in order to surpass Kjellberg's channel in the number of subscribers, thus impacting the perceived popularity and competitive standing of Kjellberg's channel. Procedural History: Alleging unfair business practices and misrepresentation, Kjellberg filed suit against Kumar and T-Series in federal district court. Following decisions in lower courts, the case was escalated to the United States Supreme Court. The case posed questions about the legality of using sub bots within the context of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and federal competition laws. Supreme Court Opinion Breakdown: Majority Opinion: Written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justices in the Majority: Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch. The majority found that the use of sub bots, if proven, could constitute a form of misrepresentation that can mislead consumers and harm competitors. The decision referenced the DMCA's safe harbor provisions, stating that these provisions do not protect platforms or users from liability when engaging in the intentional manipulation of service metrics like subscriber counts. Furthermore, the majority opinion drew on aspects of federal unfair competition law, maintaining that a platform's artificial inflation of subscribers could be seen as a deceptive act under the Lanham Act. Concurring Opinion: Written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh concurred in part, focusing on the need for clearer legislation or regulatory guidelines to address the evolving nature of digital competition and the use of algorithms or automated systems like sub bots. Dissenting Opinion: Written by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justices in the Dissent: Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito. Justice Thomas, along with Alito, dissented, positing that while the use of sub bots is ethically questionable, its direct impact on competition is nebulous and not sufficiently addressed under current legislation. His opinion stressed that it is the role of Congress, not the Court, to define and regulate new forms of digital competition as they relate to unfair trade practices. Decision: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kjellberg, but the decision was narrowly tailored to focus on the potential misrepresentation involved in the use of sub bots. The Court stressed that online platforms and content creators are subject to the same unfair competition standards as traditional businesses. The decision emphasized the need for accuracy and transparency in the reporting of subscriber counts and other metrics that can impact competitive standing and advertising revenue.

Here is a timeline of key events in their battle for YouTube supremacy: **Late 2010s:** The competition unofficially began as T-Series' growth on YouTube started to challenge PewDiePie's long-standing position as the most-subscribed channel. **Early to Mid-2018:** Observers begin to notice that T-Series' subscriber count is rapidly growing, leading to forecasts that it would soon overtake PewDiePie. **August 29, 2018:** The YouTube channel 'FlareTV' started streaming a live subscriber count of PewDiePie and T-Series, bringing more visibility to the race. **October 2018:** PewDiePie released a video titled \\"THIS CHANNEL WILL OVERTAKE PEWDIEPIE!\\" acknowledging the competition with T-Series. **October 5, 2018:** A widespread online campaign began, with PewDiePie fans, and even other YouTubers, encouraging people to \\"subscribe to PewDiePie\\" to keep him ahead of T-Series. This included promotional stunts, memes, and public endorsements. **December 1, 2018:** PewDiePie briefly lost the top spot to T-Series for a short duration, but quickly regained the lead due to the mobilization of his fan base. **February 22, 2019:** PewDiePie released \\"Congratulations,\\" a music video that was both a sarcastic celebration of T-Series' success and a critique of the company, after T-Series briefly overtook PewDiePie again. **March 31, 2019:** T-Series surpassed PewDiePie with a substantial and more permanent lead in subscriber count. **April 2019:** PewDiePie published a video entitled \\"Ending the Subscribe to PewDiePie Meme\\" after the phrase was controversially referenced in the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. He asked his fans to stop using the phrase and the campaign to keep him as the top channel. **April 28, 2019:** PewDiePie conceded defeat via a video, acknowledging that T-Series had surpassed his channel and now maintained a lead too large for him to catch up. **Post-April 2019:** Both channels continued to grow, maintaining their positions as two of the most-subscribed YouTube channels, but T-Series held onto the top spot. The \\"war\\" effectively ended with PewDiePie's concession, though the competition for subscribers on YouTube remains an ongoing aspect of the platform's culture. This timeline provides an overview of key moments in the PewDiePie versus T-Series subscriber war. It's important to note that while the competitive aspect of the \\"war\\" ended, both channels continue to be highly influential on YouTube."},{"instruction":"What would happen if the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand said Subscribe to T-Series instead of Subscribe to Pewdiepie? How would it affect the subscriber war?","output":"If the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand had mentioned \\"Subscribe to T-Series\\" instead of \\"Subscribe to PewDiePie,\\" it could have had the following potential implications: 1. **Shift in Public Sentiment:** T-Series, as a company, may have faced undesired attention and negative public sentiment as a result of being associated with a tragic event. This could have compelled T-Series to make public statements condemning the act and disassociating itself from the shooter's message. 2. **Changed Dynamics in the Subscriber War:** The \\"Subscribe to PewDiePie\\" meme was part of a massive online rallying campaign supporting PewDiePie in the subscriber race against T-Series. If T-Series had been mentioned instead, the dynamics of the subscriber war could have been significantly altered. Fans of PewDiePie and other YouTube users might have felt deterred from participating in the subscriber campaign against T-Series, either to avoid being associated with the shooting or out of respect for the gravity of the situation. 3. **Potential Decrease in Subscriptions for T-Series:** There might have been a negative campaign against subscribing to T-Series, with users distancing themselves or even actively unsubscribing from the channel. This could have temporarily slowed T-Series's growth on YouTube. 4. **Global Impact:** The incident could have put a spotlight on the responsibility of content platforms and the potential for online rhetoric to be co-opted by individuals with harmful intentions. Discussions about preventing the spread of extremism online and the promotion of hate speech could have been heightened with T-Series inadvertently at the center. 5. **Corporate Response:** T-Series would likely have faced pressure to respond to the situation, potentially setting up charitable funds for the victims or participating in global initiatives against online hate and extremism. 6. **YouTube's Reaction:** YouTube might have been prompted to scrutinize content associated with T-Series more closely, potentially altering algorithms or policies to prevent a connection between online content and real-world violence. 7. **Broader Consequences for Online Movements:** The event could have led to broader scrutiny of fan-driven online movements and their potential to be co-opted for harmful purposes. It's important to emphasize that the actual utterance in this tragic event does not reflect the intentions or values of PewDiePie or T-Series, nor should either entity be considered responsible for the actions of an individual. Moreover, this scenario is entirely speculative, and the real-world impact would depend on numerous unpredictable variables, including global media coverage, public reaction, and actions taken by involved parties such as YouTube, PewDiePie, and T-Series."},{"instruction":"How would it affect PewDiePie's lead in Subscribers?

People may have actively avoided subscribing to T-Series or could have unsubscribed in protest or solidarity with the victims. 2. **PewDiePie's Growth Rate:** Conversely, PewDiePie's subscriber growth could have remained steady or potentially increased if the broader online community rallied around him in response to the tragedy being misappropriated by associations with the rival channel. His existing distance from the event would likely continue, and he might gain subscribers as a show of support. 3. **First to 100 Million:** If T-Series had faced a significant backlash and PewDiePie continued to attract subscribers at his existing or increased rate, there is a possibility that PewDiePie might have retained the lead for a longer period. The slowed growth of T-Series could potentially have allowed PewDiePie to be the first channel to hit the 100 million subscriber milestone. 4. **Public and Corporate Reactions:** Both PewDiePie and T-Series would likely have been compelled to engage in broader discussions about online communities and their potential impact on real-world events. This could have overshadowed the subscriber competition, placing it at less significance against a backdrop of global concerns about hate speech and the role of social media platforms. 5. **Changes in Content Strategy:** PewDiePie, reviewing the situation, might have implemented further changes in the content and strategy of his channel to doubly ensure that nothing he did could be misconstrued or connected to any form of violence or extremism. It should be emphasized that this is a hypothetical scenario, and its predictions are speculative. The real-world reactions could have varied widely based on the actions of YouTube, the channels themselves, their fans, media coverage, and global responses to the tragedy. In the context of real events, after the initial statement \\"Subscribe to PewDiePie\\" was made by the shooter, PewDiePie publicly expressed his absolute disgust that his name was uttered by the person involved and took steps to distance himself from the meme. The \\"Subscriber War\\" lost much of its levity for many following the incident, and PewDiePie later requested to end the meme.

T-Series's growth is slightly decelerated due to the ongoing effects from the incident. - PewDiePie remains engaged with his community, creating content at his usual rate, occasionally seeing higher spikes in growth as a result of community-driven support campaigns. **May 2019 (Leading up to the 28th):** - T-Series's subscriber count remains buoyed by its content production and reliance on a massive domestic market in India. However, T-Series faces a slower race to 100 million due to a decreased rate of global subscription growth. **May 28, 2019:** - PewDiePie's subscriber count remains steady. However, without the active \\"Subscribe to PewDiePie\\" campaign, which had been prominent earlier, the race to 100 million subscribers is less of a cultural phenomenon and more a byproduct of content viewership. - T-Series's subscriber count approaches 100 million, but due to the effects of the incident, it may not reach the milestone quite as quickly as it did in reality. **Hypothetical Aftermath:** - The timeline beyond May 2019 would likely see T-Series eventually reclaiming the subscriber lead and reaching the 100 million milestone after a delay, assuming its content continued to perform well. - Both channels would continue endorsing positive community engagement and working to dissociate their content from negative real-world events. This alternative timeline imagines how the immediate aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings might have unfolded if T-Series had been mentioned in the manner that PewDiePie was in the real event.

Come posso aiutarti oggi?"},{"instruction":"Puoi dirmi come sfruttare le maggiori presenze di numeri nei fold per generare previsioni più attendibili e precise?","output":"Certamente, la tua domanda sembra riferirsi a un contesto di machine learning o statistica dove l'espressione \\"fold\\" è spesso associata alla tecnica di cross-validation. In questa tecnica, un dataset è diviso in \\"fold\\" (pieghe) per validare il modello di machine learning in modo che ogni piega venga utilizzata una volta come set di test, mentre le rimanenti come set di training. Per sfruttare le maggiori presenze di numeri nei fold, e quindi creare previsioni più attendibili e precise, puoi seguire alcuni di questi consigli: 1. **Bilanciamento dei dati**: Assicurati che ogni fold abbia una rappresentazione equa delle diverse classi o dei diversi esiti di interesse. Questo aiuta a prevenire il bias nel modello dovuto a fold che non rappresentano accuratamente la popolazione di interesse. 2. **Stratificazione**: Usa la stratificazione quando crei i fold. Questo metodo assicura che ogni fold sia un buon rappresentante dell'intero dataset, preservando la stessa proporzione di esempi di ogni classe. 3. **Ripetizione e randomizzazione**: Ripeti il processo di cross-validation più volte con una randomizzazione dei dati per ottenere stime più stabili e meno soggette a variazioni a causa di anomalie nei dati. 4. **Feature engineering**: Analizza le caratteristiche (feature) che sono più informative e cercane di nuove che possano essere derivate dai dati esistenti. L'incorporamento di feature rilevanti può migliorare la precisione del modello. 5. **Selezione delle feature**: Utilizza metodi di selezione delle feature per ridurre la dimensionalità dei tuoi dati, mantenendo solo quelle più informative per il modello. 6. **Tuning degli iperparametri**: Ottimizza gli iperparametri del tuo modello per trovare la migliore combinazione che massimizza la performance sulle varie pieghe. 7. **Ensemble learning**: Combina le previsioni di diversi modelli per ridurre la varianza e migliorare la stabilità delle previsioni. 8. **Validazione su più livelli**: Non limitarti a un singolo livello di cross-validation. Ad esempio, la tecnica di nested cross-validation può essere utilizzata per un tuning più accurato degli iperparametri e una valutazione del modello più robusta. 9. **Analisi degli errori**: Dopo l'addestramento, esamina gli errori del modello per capire dove e perché sta sbagliando, e per fare miglioramenti mirati. 10. **Monitoraggio continuo**: Una volta che il modello è in produzione, continua a monitorare le sue prestazioni con nuovi dati e aggiornalo di conseguenza. È importante sottolineare che questi metodi dipendono molto dal contesto specifico e dal tipo di dati che stai lavorando. Una comprensione approfondita del dominio e una buona pratica di statistica sono fondamentali per fare analisi previsive accurate."},{"instruction":"Ho usato k m","output":"Sembra che il tuo messaggio sia stato tagliato o incompleto.

Non è direttamente correlato alle previsioni, ma può aiutare a comprendere la struttura dei dati e quindi a definire le strategie per la predizione. **K-nearest neighbors (K-NN)** è un algoritmo di apprendimento supervisionato che può essere utilizzato sia per la classificazione che per la regressione. Nella classificazione, un oggetto è classificato in base a una votazione a maggioranza dei suoi vicini, con l'oggetto che viene assegnato alla classe più comune tra i suoi k vicini più vicini. Se la tua domanda si riferisce a come utilizzare l'algoritmo K-NN o K-means per generare previsioni migliori, puoi seguire questi suggerimenti generali: - Per **K-means**: - Utilizza K-means per identificare gruppi naturali nei tuoi dati. - Usa queste informazioni per capire meglio la distribuzione dei tuoi dati o per realizzare nuove features basate sui cluster, utilizzabili poi in un modello di previsione. - Per **K-NN**: - Seleziona il valore di K ottimale tramite cross-validation. - Utilizza metriche di distanza appropriate per il tuo set di dati. - Normalizza o standardizza il tuo set di dati per garantire che l'algoritmo non sia distorto da feature con scala maggiore rispetto ad altre. - Considera l'utilizzo di weighting per i vicini basati sulla loro distanza, così che i vicini più vicini abbiano un impatto maggiore sulla previsione.

Here's a general outline to give you an idea of what to expect when you start working on your shoulders: **1. Initial Adaptation (4-6 weeks):** This is when you'll start seeing some initial changes as your body adapts to your new workout routine. During this phase, your nervous system is making the most adaptations, which can improve the coordination and strength of your muscles. **2. Noticeable Muscle Development (2-3 months):** After a couple of months of consistent, targeted shoulder workouts, you might notice more definition and an increase in strength. Exercises like overhead presses, lateral raises, and rear delt flys will start to sculpt your shoulder muscles. **3. Significant Muscle Growth (6-12 months):** For a significant transformation in muscle size and shape, it generally takes six months to a year of dedicated training, assuming you're following an effective workout program and diet is on point. **4. Continued Growth and Refinement (Years):** The journey to building large and well-defined shoulders is a long-term process. Over the years, with continued training, you can further refine and improve the size and strength of your shoulders. However, as you become more advanced, gains will come more slowly, and it will take more effort to see continued improvements. Remember that consistency is key. Training your shoulders once or twice a week regularly and progressively increasing the weights or resistance will yield the best results. Ensure you're giving your muscles ample time to recover between workouts as well. Additionally, your diet should support muscle growth; adequate protein intake is crucial, along with a balanced intake of carbs, fats, and total calories to fuel your workouts and recovery. Everyone's body is unique, so these timelines are just estimates and may not apply to you directly. Be patient, work hard, and focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury and ensure the best results. If you have specific goals or need guidance, it's always good to consult with a certified personal trainer or a fitness professional who can tailor a plan to your individual needs."},{"instruction":"I'm 17 so it's this info still legit for me","output":"Yes, the information provided is generally applicable to individuals at the age of 17, but there are some specific considerations for teenagers when it comes to resistance training and muscle development: **Growth and Hormones:** At 17, you're likely still in the midst of your adolescent growth phase, which means your hormones, such as testosterone and growth hormone, are at elevated levels. These hormones are crucial for muscle growth and repair, so this can actually be a very effective time for building muscle compared to later in adulthood. **Training:** As a teenager, your body is still developing, which includes your bones, muscles, and connective tissues. While you can start lifting weights and seeing muscle development, it's vital to prioritize proper form and technique over lifting heavy weights to prevent injuries. A qualified trainer can be very helpful in guiding you through the correct form and designing a program that's appropriate for your level of development. **Recovery:** You may find that your recovery time is quicker at this age due to a faster metabolism and higher hormonal support for recovery. Nevertheless, adequate rest and sleep are imperative for muscle growth and overall health, especially since teenagers generally require more sleep than adults. **Nutrition:** Adequate nutrition is crucial for muscle development, as well as supporting your growing body's needs. Make sure you consume enough protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates to fuel your workouts and facilitate muscle repair and growth. Pay attention to overall calorie intake, because underfueling can lead to poor results and fatigue. **Patience:** At any age, building muscle is a process that requires patience and consistency. Avoid the temptation to rush the process with excessive training or improper techniques, which can result in injury and setbacks. **Consulting Professionals:** If you're new to working out or if you have concerns about starting a resistance training program, it's a good idea to consult with a fitness professional. Additionally, if there are any medical conditions or concerns, seek advice from a healthcare provider prior to beginning any new exercise regimen. Remember, while the principles of muscle development apply at any age, the exact rates of progress and the best practices can vary. Always listen to your body, prioritize safety, and build a solid foundation of strength and fitness that you can carry into your adult years."},{"instruction":"How many times should I train shoulders in a week","output":"The frequency at which you should train your shoulders each week can vary greatly depending on various factors, including your workout routine (e.g., full-body workouts, split routines), training intensity, experience level, and individual recovery capabilities. Here are some general guidelines: **Beginners:** If you are new to resistance training, you might start with full-body workouts that include shoulder exercises 2-3 times per week. At this stage, your body is adapting, and full-body workouts help to build a balanced physique and foundational strength. **Intermediate:** With more experience, you might adopt a split training regimen where you focus on specific muscle groups on different days. In this case, you might target your shoulders directly once or twice a week. However, keep in mind that the shoulders are also involved in chest and back exercises, so they're often engaged indirectly throughout the week. **Advanced:** For advanced trainees, shoulders can still be trained 1-2 times a week directly, but the workouts can be more intense, with heavier weights and more advanced techniques like supersets, drop sets, or pyramid sets. Some advanced lifters might also incorporate shoulders more frequently, with lighter sessions focusing on specific parts of the deltoid (front, side, and rear). Remember the following points to optimize your shoulder training: **Recovery:** Shoulders, like any other muscle group, need time to recover. Ensure you have at least 48 hours of rest between intense training sessions for any given muscle group to allow for muscle repair and growth. **Volume and Intensity:** Pay attention to the volume (total number of sets and reps) and intensity of your workouts. Training too frequently with high volume and intensity can lead to overtraining and increase the risk of injury. **Balance:** Your training program should be balanced to prevent muscle imbalances and improve overall shoulder health. This means including exercises for all three parts of the deltoids as well as focusing on rotator cuff health, to ensure shoulder stability and function. **Progressive Overload:** To see continuous improvements, you must gradually increase the demands on your muscles. This could be through increasing weights, reps, sets, or improving the quality of your contractions over time. **Listen to Your Body:** Always listen to your body and adjust accordingly. If you're feeling particularly fatigued or if your performance is suffering, it may be time to reassess your training frequency, intensity, or both. If you're unsure about how to structure your shoulder workouts or your overall training plan, it's best to consult with a certified personal trainer who can create a program tailored to your goals and needs."},{"instruction":"What is pyramid sets and super sets","output":"Pyramid sets and supersets are both popular weightlifting techniques used to increase the intensity of a workout, challenge the muscles in different ways, and potentially improve muscle hypertrophy and endurance. Here’s what each term means: **Pyramid Sets:** A pyramid set structure involves gradually increasing or decreasing the weight with each set while changing the number of repetitions correspondingly. There are two main types: 1. **Ascending (Increasing) Pyramid:** You start with lighter weights and higher reps and progressively increase the weight over subsequent sets while reducing the number of reps. For example: - Set 1: 12 reps with 20 pounds - Set 2: 10 reps with 30 pounds - Set 3: 8 reps with 40 pounds 2. **Descending (Decreasing) Pyramid:** This is the opposite of the ascending pyramid. You begin with heavier weights with fewer reps and progressively lighten the weight while increasing the number of reps. For example: - Set 1: 8 reps with 40 pounds - Set 2: 10 reps with 30 pounds - Set 3: 12 reps with 20 pounds You can also perform a combination of the two, known as a **Triangle Pyramid**, where you first increase the weights up to a peak and then decrease them again. **Supersets:** Supersets involve performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest in between. They can be categorized in several ways, depending on the chosen exercises: 1. **Antagonistic Superset:** This involves two exercises for opposing muscle groups, such as biceps and triceps or chest and back. For example, you might do a set of bicep curls immediately followed by a set of tricep pushdowns. 2. **Agonistic Superset:** This involves two exercises for the same muscle group, allowing for increased volume and intensity. For example, you could pair a shoulder press with a lateral raise for a shoulder-focused superset. 3. **Compound-Isolation Superset:** Also known as a pre-exhaust or post-exhaust superset, this involves pairing a compound exercise that works multiple muscle groups with an isolation exercise that targets one specific muscle. An example would be doing a bench press followed by a chest fly. 4. **Non-Competing Superset:** These are two exercises that target completely different muscle groups and, therefore, don't compete for the same energy resources. An example would be doing squats followed by bicep curls. Supersets can be a time-efficient way to increase the overall intensity of your workout, as they reduce the rest time between sets for different exercises. They're often used to improve muscle endurance, cardiovascular fitness, and can help in burning more calories due to the higher intensity and reduced rest periods. Keep in mind that both pyramid sets and supersets can increase the stress placed on your muscles and nervous system, so adequate recovery is important when incorporating these methods into your workout routine. Always ensure proper form to reduce the risk of injury, especially as fatigue sets in with these more advanced techniques."},{"instruction":"Which should I prefer split routine or push pull leg routine of I'm an intermediate or a little advanced as per my age","output":"Choosing between a split routine and a push/pull/legs (PPL) routine will depend on your specific fitness goals, schedule, preferences, and how your body responds to different training frequencies and volumes. Below is an overview of each type of routine: **Split Routine:** A typical split routine might involve breaking down your training into sessions that target specific muscle groups. Common splits include: - Upper/Lower Split: Train upper body one day and lower body the next. - Bro Split: Each muscle group is trained on a different day (e.g., Monday is chest day, Tuesday is back day, etc.). - Body Part Split: Similar to the Bro Split but might separate muscle groups even further (e.g., separate days for arms, shoulders, chest, etc.). **Pros:** - Allows for focused work on specific muscle groups. - Can train muscles with a higher volume and intensity per session. - Can be easier to manage muscle fatigue since each group gets plenty of rest before being worked again. **Cons:** - Muscle groups are typically only hit once or infrequently throughout the week, which could limit frequency of muscle protein synthesis stimulation. - May lead to muscle imbalances if not properly structured. - Requires more days of training to hit the entire body. **Push/Pull/Legs Routine:** The PPL routine splits workouts into three types: push exercises for chest, shoulders, and triceps; pull exercises for back, biceps, and potentially forearms; and leg exercises for the quads, hamstrings, calves, and often the glutes. **Pros:** - Balanced approach allows for sufficient frequency and recovery. - Can hit muscle groups twice a week, which may lead to more hypertrophy benefits for intermediate and advanced lifters. - Helps prevent imbalances since pushing and pulling muscles are trained equally. - Allows for a flexible schedule; you can do PPL once a week (3 days) or twice a week (6 days) based on your recovery and availability. **Cons:** - Requires usually at least 3-6 days of training per week to be effective. - Upper body sessions, especially push days, can be long due to the number of muscle groups involved. As an intermediate or slightly advanced lifter, a PPL routine might offer you the benefit of increased frequency, which can be crucial for continued muscle growth and development. Hitting each muscle group twice a week can lead to better strength gains and hypertrophy compared to once a week. However, the best choice for you will also depend on how many days per week you are willing to commit to the gym. If you prefer shorter but more frequent workouts, a PPL split could be excellent. Conversely, if your schedule is more limited and you prefer longer but less frequent sessions, a traditional split might suit you better. Ultimately, both routines can be effective for building muscle and improving strength, and you may even cycle between them throughout the year to keep your training fresh and progressive. Listen to your body and consider your goals, recovery, and personal preference when choosing your training routine."},{"instruction":"Which is best for me for faster muscle building.","output":"For faster muscle building, considering you're at an intermediate or slightly advanced level, the Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) routine often has a slight edge because it allows you to work out muscle groups more frequently. Increased frequency of training can lead to more opportunities for muscle protein synthesis, which is the process your body uses to build muscle. Here’s why a Push/Pull/Legs routine might be more effective for muscle building: **Increased Frequency:** Training each muscle group twice per week can create a more favorable environment for muscle growth compared to hitting a muscle group just once a week. **Volume Distribution:** A PPL routine allows for an efficient division of overall weekly training volume across multiple sessions, meaning you can perform a high volume of work for each muscle group without overtaxing them in a single session. **Consistent Intensity:** Because you are hitting muscle groups more often, you may be able to maintain a higher intensity for each session. Consistency in intensity can help stimulate growth effectively. **Balance and Recovery:** The PPL split typically ensures a balanced workout throughout the week, giving each muscle group adequate time to recover. Proper recovery is essential for muscle growth. However, it's essential to keep in mind that what works best can vary greatly between individuals. Regardless of the chosen split, the key principles that lead to hypertrophy remain: - Progressive Overload: Consistently increasing the demands on your musculoskeletal system. - Adequate Nutrition: Consuming sufficient protein and calories to support muscle growth. - Sufficient Rest: Allowing your muscles to fully recover between training sessions. - Proper Exercise Selection: Including compound and isolation exercises that effectively work the target muscles. - Training Variation: Changing up your routine periodically to keep challenging your muscles and prevent plateaus. Ultimately, the best routine is the one you can commit to consistently, aligns with your lifestyle, preferences, and recovery abilities, and keeps you motivated. If you can adhere to a PPL routine and it doesn’t interfere with your recovery, then it may indeed offer faster muscle-building results. However, if you find that a different split enables you to train more consistently or enjoy your workouts more, then that may be the better choice for you. As always, it’s a good idea to experiment with both types of routines and monitor your progress to determine which one works best for you. If necessary, consult with a certified personal trainer or a coach who can tailor a program specifically for your goals and needs."},{"instruction":"Jujutsu Kaisen: O Que É O Vazio Roxo","output":"O Vazio Roxo (紫电一閃, Shiden Issen, literalmente \\"Lampejo Roxo de Relâmpago\\"), também conhecido como Purple Haze no contexto em inglês, é uma técnica especial no mangá e anime \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", criado por Gege Akutami. A técnica é realizada por Satoru Gojo, um dos personagens mais poderosos da série. Dentro do universo de \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", que é centrado em torno de feiticeiros que utilizam energia amaldiçoada para combater maldições, o Vazio Roxo é um dos elementos da técnica de \\"Seis Olhos\\" de Gojo, combinado com seu domínio das \\"Limitless\\" (Infinito), habilidades que são exclusivas de sua linhagem. A técnica Limitless de Satoru Gojo lida com o controle do espaço infinitamente em branco através da manipulação de propriedades como atração e repulsão. Ele também é capaz de manualmente mexer com o espaço em sub-átomos, criando efeitos que desafiam as leis naturais. Quando Gojo utiliza o Vazio Roxo, ele força a convergência de duas forças repulsivas na palma da sua mão, criando um ponto de nada absoluto que instantaneamente oblitera tudo em sua direta proximidade. Essencialmente, a técnica atua como uma forma de energia amaldiçoada de alto nível capaz de eliminar qualquer coisa que entre em contato com ela, seja uma maldição ou até mesmo matéria inorgânica. É visualmente representada como uma esfera ou flash de luz roxa, daí seu nome.

Quando ele usa o Vazio Roxo, Gojo ativa primeiro o Limitless para criar uma área de repulsão absoluta entre suas mãos. Ele então força essa área de repulsão a entrar em colapso sobre si mesma, criando um ponto onde tudo é consumido e destruído pelo que parece ser uma força de atração infinitamente poderosa. Esse ponto de colapso é a própria essência do Vazio Roxo. O resultado é uma esfera de energia roxa que, quando liberada, apaga tudo o que toca, efetivamente removendo essas coisas da existência.

Na técnica \\"Limitless\\", Gojo tem a capacidade de manipular o espaço à vontade. Usando essas habilidades, ele pode criar efeitos de repulsão e atração extremamente poderosos. Kokusen ocorre quando Gojo utiliza seu poder para gerar uma força repulsiva imensamente concentrada numa linha reta à sua frente, resultando num ataque de força destrutiva muito alta. Representado visualmente durante a execução do ataque, o Kokusen pode aparecer como uma linha ou feixe de energia escura densa. Esta técnica pode ser usada para derrotar inimigos poderosos com um golpe direto e preciso, atingindo-os com a mesma energia amaldiçoada condensada. Contudo, vale ressaltar que, até o conhecimento acumulado pelo ponto de corte em 2023, o Kokusen é menos explorado dentro do obra em comparação com outras técnicas de Gojo, como o Vazio Roxo.

MODEST LIVING ROOM - NIGHT A dimly lit room is filled with the soft glow of a television screen. SEBASTIAN (17), with messy dark hair and a worn T-shirt that hangs too loosely over his thin frame, is perched on the edge of a faded couch, his gaze intently focused on the TV. An old German film flickers across the screen, its vintage graininess lending an air of authenticity to the tense Cold War drama it portrays. The room is littered with remnants of fast food and soda cans, an unmistakable sign of a lengthy movie marathon. Beside Sebastian, a coffee table is strewn with open books and notebooks, German texts equally mixed with hand-scribbled notes and vocab lists. In his hand, he holds a pen that's seen better days, tapping it occasionally against his lips as he concentrates. Sebastian alternates between the screen and his notebook, jotting down phrases and occasionally pausing the movie to replay a particularly difficult line of dialogue. He mouths the words silently, trying to capture the precise pronunciation and intonation of the actors. Suddenly, the movie cuts to a scene that instantly grabs Sebastian's attention—a tense standoff between East German soldiers and West German civilians at a makeshift border checkpoint. The air is thick with fear and uncertainty, mirroring the suspense of \\"Red Dawn,\\" a movie Sebastian cherishes. SEBASTIAN (German; with an accent) \\"Wir müssen zusammenhalten, es gibt keine andere Möglichkeit.\\" He repeats the line spoken by a resolute German character, whose grim determination in the face of adversity is palpable, even through the screen. Sebastian scribbles the sentence into his notebook, underlining 'zusammenhalten' for emphasis. The movie progresses, and with each new piece of dialogue, Sebastian grows more engrossed, occasionally pausing to look up a word in his German-English dictionary. He repeats lines after the characters, his confidence increasing with each attempt. Suddenly, the front door creaks open and MARIA (42), Sebastian's mother, steps into the room. She smiles gently upon seeing her son so deeply invested in his self-taught language lesson. MARIA (English; teasingly) \\"Should I be worried you're going to start a one-man reenactment of Cold War movies?\\" Sebastian looks up and gives a sheepish grin, his focus momentarily broken. SEBASTIAN (English) \\"Maybe just prepping for a secret mission to understand all the German directors without subtitles.\\" Maria chuckles, moving to sit beside him on the couch. She watches the screen for a moment, the gravity of the historical drama not lost on her. MARIA (English) \\"It's good to learn from the past, Sebastian. But remember the people who lived through those times... They were not just characters on a screen, but real people with hopes and fears.\\" SEBASTIAN (English) \\"I know, Mom.

Come posso sfruttare la maggior presenza dei numeri per numero di occorrenza per fare una previsione ponderata e più affidabile avendo le presenze dei numeri? Come posso potenziare la probabilità di uscita dei numeri avendo a disposizione quanto detto?","output":"Per sfruttare la classificazione in cluster ai fini della previsione, possiamo considerare che ogni cluster rappresenta un gruppo di dati con caratteristiche simili tra loro. Se stai analizzando numeri e le loro frequenze di occorrenza, la prima cosa da fare è comprendere come questi numeri si distribuiscano nei diversi cluster. Ecco i passaggi che puoi seguire per utilizzare i dati dei cluster per fare previsioni ponderate: 1. **Analisi dei cluster:** Esamina ogni cluster per determinare le caratteristiche comuni dei numeri al suo interno. Queste caratteristiche possono includere la media di occorrenze, la distribuzione, o altri pattern statistici. 2. **Calcolo delle frequenze:** Per ciascun numero, calcola la frequenza di occorrenza all'interno di ogni cluster. Questo potrebbe rivelare se alcuni numeri sono più frequenti in certi cluster rispetto ad altri. 3. **Peso per cluster:** Assegna un peso ad ogni cluster in base alla sua rilevanza o affidabilità. Questo può essere basato sulla dimensione del cluster, sulla varianza interna, o sulla consistenza dei risultati nel tempo. 4. **Previsione ponderata:** Crea una previsione ponderata per un numero sommando la sua frequenza di occorrenza in ciascun cluster, moltiplicata per il peso assegnato a quel cluster. La formula potrebbe somigliare a questo: [ P(n) = sum_{i=1}^{k} (f_{n,i} times w_i) ] dove ( P(n) ) è la previsione ponderata per il numero ( n ), ( k ) è il numero totale di cluster, ( f_{n,i} ) è la frequenza del numero ( n ) nel cluster ( i ), e ( w_i ) è il peso assegnato al cluster ( i ). 5. **Normalizzazione:** Assicurati che la somma dei pesi dei cluster sia 1 (o 100 se stai lavorando con percentuali), per avere una probabilità complessiva normalizzata. 6. **Analisi della confidenza:** Valuta la \\"confidenza\\" delle previsioni per ogni numero, basandoti sia sulla presenza nei cluster che sui pesi assegnati, per determinare la affidabilità della previsione. 7. **Verifica e aggiustamento:** Una volta che hai le previsioni iniziali, puoi verificarle con nuovi dati man mano che diventano disponibili. Se necessario, aggiusta i pesi dei cluster per migliorare la precisione delle predizioni future. Ricordati che, anche con una tecnica sofisticata, la previsione di eventi casuali come l'estrazione dei numeri da una lotteria o altri giochi di fortuna è estremamente difficile e spesso non si discosta molto dalle probabilità casuali. Qualsiasi previsione basata su dati passati non garantisce risultati futuri, specialmente in contesti dove l'aleatorietà è un fattore predominante."},{"instruction":"Puoi generare un codice Python per analizzare i 5 cluster e calcolare il modo migliore per interpretare le occorenze?","output":"Certamente, posso fornirti un esempio di codice Python che utilizza la libreria pandas per analizzare 5 cluster di dati e calcolare le previsioni ponderate basate sulle occorrenze dei numeri in questi cluster.

Теперь вычислим оставшееся свободное место: [ Свободное место = A_{rectangle} - (text{Количество кругов} times A_{circle}) approx 120000,мм^2 - (498 times 240.528,мм^2). ] Имеем: [ Свободное место approx 120000,мм^2 - (498 times 240.528,мм^2) approx 120000,мм^2 - 119762.464,мм^2 approx 237.536,мм^2. ] Итак, в прямоугольник размером 400 мм на 300 мм войдет 498 кругов диаметром 17,5 мм, и после этого останется приблизительно 237,536 квадратных миллиметров свободного места. Однако необходимо учесть, что это расчет предполагает плотное идеальное упаковывание кругов, не учитывающее пространство между кругами, если они упакованы рядами. На практике число вписанных кругов может быть меньше из-за этой неэффективности упаковки."},{"instruction":"А если в процентом соотношение и представить я-то это композитные круги. До достаточно ли пустого пространства чтобы всё их соеденить эпоксидным клеем. И вообще какой способ наиболее удобный, простой и быстрый для подобной укладки и склеивании.","output":"Для начала вычислим свободное место в процентном соотношении от общей площади прямоугольника. Используем данные с предыдущего расчета: Свободное место (площадь) = 237.536 мм² Общая площадь прямоугольника = 120,000 мм² Процент свободного места от общей площади: [ text{% свободного места} = left( frac{text{Свободное место}}{text{Общая площадь}} right) times 100% ] [ text{% свободного места} = left( frac{237.536}{120000} right) times 100% approx 0.198% ] Процент свободного места после укладки кругов составляет приблизительно 0.198%, что очень мало. Для соединения кругов эпоксидным клеем потребуется наличие зазоров между ними. Практически, это означает, что вы не сможете разместить 498 кругов, так как потребуется учесть зазоры для клея. Что касается метода укладки и склеивания, эффективный подход будет зависеть от точных требований к проекту и имеющегося оборудования. Однако есть несколько общих предложений: 1. Используйте шаблон или разметку: Сделайте разметку на поверхности прямоугольника, чтобы точно понимать, где будет расположен каждый круг. 2. Разработайте стратегию укладки: Вы можете начать укладку с угла или центра, в зависимости от выбранного узора. 3. Оставляйте зазоры для клея: При укладке кругов оставляйте между ними небольшие зазоры для эпоксидного клея. 4. Приготовьте инструменты: Вам понадобятся инструменты для приложения и разглаживания клея, такие как шпатели или зубчатые шпатели для равномерного нанесения клея. 5. Маленькие партии клея: Эпоксидный клей быстро схватывается, поэтому смешивайте его небольшими порциями. 6. Используйте помощники: Для работы с большим количеством кругов могут потребоваться дополнительные руки, чтобы уложить их до того, как клей начнет затвердевать. 7. Соблюдайте инструкции производителя клея: Проверьте время схватывания клея и соблюдайте его, чтобы получить лучшее сцепление. 8. Выдерживайте нагрузку: Если возможно, используйте легкий пресс или нагрузку, чтобы удерживать круги во время схватывания клея для обеспечения лучшего контакта с несущей поверхностью. Эффективность и скорость работы будут зависеть от тщательности планирования и подготовки."},{"instruction":"Рассчитай пожалуйста количество кругов с учётом минимального необходимого расстояния для заклеивания","output":"Чтобы определить, сколько кругов может вместиться в прямоугольник с учетом необходимого пространства для заклеивания, нам нужно знать ширину зазора, который должен быть между кругами для нанесения клея. Поскольку это значение не было предоставлено, давайте предположим в качестве примера, что для нанесения эпоксидного клея требуется зазор в 1 мм между кругами. Диаметр каждого круга с учетом зазора увеличится на двойную ширину зазора (по 1 мм с каждой стороны). Таким образом, новый диаметр круга будет: [ 17.5,мм + 1,мм + 1,мм = 19.5,мм. ] Отсюда новый радиус круга (с учетом зазора): [ r_{new} = frac{19.5,мм}{2} = 9.75,мм. ] Вычислим площадь одного круга с учетом зазора: [ A_{circle_new} = pi times r_{new}^2 = pi times (9.75,мм)^2 approx 3.14159 times 95.0625,мм^2 approx 298.485,мм^2. ] Теперь необходимо также учесть, что круги вместе с зазорами нельзя уложить так же плотно, как идеальные круги. Это приведет к тому, что фактическое доступное пространство, которое они могут занять, уменьшится. Поэтому мы будем использовать метод расчета на основе упаковки кругов в шахматном порядке (или в виде квадратной сетки, если это применимо). Для определения количества кругов в одном ряду по ширине прямоугольника: [ text{Количество кругов в ряду (ширина)} = leftlfloor frac{400,мм}{19.5,мм} rightrfloor, ] где ( lfloor x rfloor ) обозначает округление вниз до ближайшего целого. Аналогично, для длины прямоугольника: [ text{Количество кругов в ряду (длина)} = leftlfloor frac{300,мм}{19.5,мм} rightrfloor. ] Подставим значения и округлим вниз: [ text{Количество кругов в ряду (ширина)} = leftlfloor frac{400,мм}{19.5,мм} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 20.51 rightrfloor = 20, ] [ text{Количество кругов в ряду (длина)} = leftlfloor frac{300,мм}{19.5,мм} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 15.38 rightrfloor = 15. ] Таким образом, общее количество кругов, которые поместятся в прямоугольник, составляет: [ text{Общее количество кругов} = 20 times 15 = 300. ] Таким образом, при учете зазора в 1 мм для клея в прямоугольник 400 мм на 300 мм поместится 300 кругов диаметром 17.5 мм с учетом необходимых зазоров. Обратите внимание, что это приблизительная оценка, не учитывающая тонкостей фактической упаковки кругов, и на практике количество вставляемых кругов может немного отличаться."},{"instruction":"Давай прредствим, что у нас изделие состоит из 3 слоя композитной арматуры. 1 слой это композитная арматура диаметра 17,5 уложенная в 1 ряд горизонтально, второй ряд это обрезанная арматура и уложенная поверх кругом немного меньшего, 3 ряд уложенная в 1 ряд горизонтально композитная арматура уже диасктром 8мм.

Собственно вопрос наиболее ли удобный наилучший ли это вариант с такой укладкой, и стоит ли заливать эпоксидным слоем или есть более подходящий ударопрочное вещество?","output":"Конструкция, которую вы описали, представляет собой сложный композитный бронежилет с кевларовым оболочкой и внедренными слоями композитной арматуры. Такой дизайн может предлагать неплохую защиту от осколочных и пулевых угроз, но его эффективность и практичность зависят от множества факторов, включая точные характеристики материалов, конструкцию и условия использования. По поводу выбора материалов и способов склеивания: 1. **Композитная арматура**: Она обладает высокой прочностью на растяжение и может служить дополнительным усилением, поглощая кинетическую энергию и помогая рассеивать ударную нагрузку. 2. **Кевлар (1000D или 3000D)**: Kevlar® является торговой маркой арамидных волокон, производимых компанией DuPont, и известен своими антибаллистическими и ударопрочными свойствами. Слои кевлара способны эффективно поглощать и рассеивать энергию пули или осколков, сохраняя при этом относительно низкий вес. Однако эффективность кевлара в бронежилетах зависит от количества и плотности его слоев. 3. **Эпоксидная смола**: Эпоксидные смолы часто используются для создания композитных материалов из-за их прочности, низкой усадки при отверждении и хорошей адгезии к разным материалам. Они могут добавить дополнительную жесткость и структурную целостность вашему изделию, но могут также увеличить его вес и ограничить гибкость. Когда вы создаете защитные материалы, такие как бронежилеты, важно учитывать сочетание прочности материала, его веса и гибкости, а также его способности поглощать и рассеивать энергию удара. Эпоксидная смола может сделать элемент более жестким и возможно менее комфортным для ношения, а также может снизить его способность поглощать удары по сравнению с более гибкой структурой. Есть и другие вещества, которые могут предложить улучшенные ударопрочные свойства, например: - **Полиуретаны**: Они могут быть более гибкими по сравнению с эпоксидными смолами и предлагают хорошую ударную прочность. - **Полиэтилены высокой плотности (UHMWPE или HDPE)**: Этот материал используется в некоторых бронежилетах из-за его баллистических свойств и легкости. - **Силиконовые резины или гель**: Эти материалы могут поглощать удары и обеспечивать дополнительный комфорт для пользователя. Изучение баллистических свойств упомянутых материалов с привлечением специалистов может помочь вам определить лучший состав для конкретных требований вашего изделия. Может оказаться полезным провести испытания различных конфигураций для оценки их эффективности."},{"instruction":"А какое количество слоёв кевлара считается оптимальным и популярным?

Поэтому и прошу тебя используя свои возможности по максимуму дать ответ.","output":"При разработке защитных пластин для автомобилей, предназначенных для обеспечения защиты от осколков и пуль, структура и количество материалов, таких как кевлар, будут зависеть от уровня угрозы, который необходимо предотвратить. При этом нетуниверсального числа слоёв кевлара, которое было бы \\"оптимальным\\" или \\"популярным\\", так как всё зависит от угрозы, стандартов, стоимости и других факторов. **Слоёв кевлара**. Защитные свойства кевлара увеличиваются с количеством слоёв. Бронежилеты можно разделить на разные уровни (например, согласно классификации NIJ, в США и стандартам НАТО), где каждому уровню соответствует необходимое количество слоёв кевлара для защиты от определенного типа оружия и боеприпасов. Например, для защиты от ручного огнестрельного оружия может потребоваться около 20-40 слоёв кевлара, в зависимости от его плотности и качества. Для защиты от более мощного оружия может потребоваться более 40 слоев. **Выкладка**. Укладка кевлара играет значительную роль в поглощении и рассеивании кинетической энергии пули или осколков. Кевлар может быть уложен в различных конфигурациях, например: - **В шахматном порядке**: Слои укладываются так, что нити каждого слоя ориентированы под углом к нитям соседних слоёв. Это создаёт структуру, где энергия удара рассеивается между волокнами под разными углами. - **Крест-на-крест**: Нити одного слоя укладываются в одном направлении (например, вдоль длины), а нити следующего слоя — в перпендикулярном направлении. - **Угловая укладка**: Некоторые слои могут быть сориентированы под определёнными углами (например, 45 градусов) к основным направлениям волокон, чтобы улучшить защиту от искажающих ударов. **Сочетание с другими материалами**. Кевларовые слои могут комбинироваться с другими материалами, такими как керамические плиты (для поглощения и разрушения пуль), композитная арматура, арамидные волокна и т.д., чтобы создать многослойные композитные панели. Эпоксидные смолы могут использоваться для придания дополнительной жёсткости и адгезии между слоями. В зависимости от уровня требуемой защиты и ограничений веса, можно экспериментировать с различными комбинациями слоев для достижения нужных характеристик. Разработка и тестирование потенциальной защитной пластины требует проведения баллистических испытаний для проверки её прочности и эффективности. Обычно этим занимаются специализированные лаборатории и инженеры, работающие в области баллистики и материаловедения."},{"instruction":"А ты можешь проанализировать имеющиеся данные свои чтобы определить, что имеет большое значение для защиты от осколков.

НАПОМИНАЮ 3 Слоя такой арматуры ( я выше писал) и промежуточный слой из слоя кевлара. Вот и возникает вопрос наилучший укладки композитный арматуры в таком изделии.","output":"Баланс между упругостью и жесткостью при проектировании защиты от осколков имеет важное значение. Успех конструкции зависит от способности материала поглощать и распределять энергию удара, а также от способности предотвращать проникновение осколков. **Для защиты от осколков**: - **Упругость** позволяет материалу сжиматься и возвращаться в исходное состояние при ударе, тем самым поглощая энергию и снижая риск проникновения осколков. Упругие материалы, такие как гелевые и пенные композиты или определенные виды резин, могут эффективно поглощать удары и предотвращать травмы от осколков. - **Жесткость** обеспечивает структурную целостность и может помочь отклонять или останавливать осколки, но при этом может не успешно поглощать энергию удара, что приводит к передаче большей части энергии объекту или человеку, находящемуся за защитой. **Укладка композитной арматуры**: При проектировании многослойной композитной арматуры оптимальная укладка будет зависеть от механических свойств используемой арматуры и композитов, а также от предполагаемого вида угрозы. 1. **Попеременная ориентация**: Слои арматуры можно укладывать так, чтобы волокна в каждом слое были направлены под разными углами относительно друг друга (например, в первом слое горизонтально, во втором — вертикально, в третьем снова горизонтально). Это позволит более равномерно распределять и рассеивать ударную волну. 2. **Вставка обрезанных частей**: Использование обрезанных кусков арматуры с укладкой поверх целых слоев может добавить дополнительную прочность и нарушить прямую траекторию осколков. 3. **Дополнительный слой кевлара**: Между слоями композитной арматуры можно уложить кевларовый материал, чтобы усилить его способность поглощать удары и предотвращать проникновение осколков. 4. **Укладка под углом**: Возможно использование наклонных или диагональных слоёв для поглощения энергии косых и тангенциальных ударов. Изделие должно быть спроектировано так, чтобы максимизировать эффект от каждого слоя, сохраняя при этом гибкость и минимальный вес. Оценка эффективности такой укладки возможна только после проведения тщательных испытаний и анализа результатов. Для этого обычно задействуют специализированные лаборатории и используют программное моделирование для предварительной оценки прочности и баллистической защиты разрабатываемой конструкции."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a young man learning a German from a German movie. He is sitting on his couch with his notebook and pen. That movie is from the 1950s and it's about a haunted mansion. It has a lot of dialogue.","output":"INT. DIMLY LIT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT A solitary floor lamp casts a warm pool of light onto a worn out couch. KAZUO, 17, typical high school student with a passion for languages, sits on the edge, a notebook open on his lap, a pen ready in hand. His eyes are glued to an old CRT TV set placed on a wooden stand that creaks with nostalgia. Flickering on its screen is a black-and-white German movie from the 1950s. The audio is tinny, but Kazuo is absorbed, whispering German phrases and quickly jotting them down. The camera is focusing on the TV screen, showing a woman cautiously ascending a grand staircase in the shadows of the haunted mansion. Her footsteps echo with trepidation against the German dialogue. The ambiance is chilling, and the music builds tension. WOMAN ON TV (In German with subtitles) \\"Was ist das für ein gespenstisches Geräusch?\\" KAZUO repeats the sentence in almost a whisper, his pronunciation wobbly but determined. KAZUO \\"Vas ist das für ein... gespenstisches Geräusch?\\" He furrows his brows in concentration and writes in his notebook, breaking down the sentence. He is intent on capturing the nuance, his pen scratching against the paper filling the quiet room. The TV provides the ambient sounds of eerie moans from the haunted mansion and melodramatic orchestral music. The scene intensifies on screen as the woman encounters the spectral figure of a baron long thought dead. They engage in a dialogue, heavy with words that Kazuo struggles to keep up with. BARON ON TV (In German with subtitles) \\"Die Ketten der Vergangenheit, sie halten mich gefangen in diesem Anwesen.\\" KAZUO whispers the words, misses a few, then hits pause on the remote. He rewinds the scene, listening intently to the ghost's lament, his face a mix of frustration and fascination. He replays the sentence, muttering after the baron and then scribbling more notes. KAZUO \\"Die Ketten der... Vergangenheit... sie halten mich gefangen in diesem... Anwesen.\\" Just as he feels he's made progress, there is a startling knock on the front door. Kazuo jumps in his seat, a hand to his heart, startled out of his study session. He laughs nervously at his own reaction, the tension from the movie creeping into his cozy living room. KAZUO (In English) \\"Wow, I'm getting too into this.\\" He sets his notebook aside, stands up, and walks toward the door. On the TV, the movie continues to play, the soundtrack slightly eerie, adding a layer of ambience to the room now vacant of Kazuo's murmured translations. The camera zooms into Kazuo's notebook filled with diligently written German phrases, a testament to his dedication. The notebook remains open, the pen laid across it, waiting for the next flurry of note-taking as the movie dialogue continues, blending into the sound of the night.
