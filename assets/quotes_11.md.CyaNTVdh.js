Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A comprehensive photography project documenting the last ten years has revealed that some areas of London remain unaffected by the financial crash while other pockets of the city have regenerated significantly. Since the project started, the average house price in the capital has increased dramatically, surpassing the £500,000 mark. The photography project was conducted by a group of talented photographers, who spent a decade capturing images of various parts of London. The images reveal stark differences between the various boroughs in terms of their financial prosperity and regeneration status. In some areas, the project found that pockets of London look untouched by the economic downturn, while in others, significant investments have been made to regenerate and rejuvenate previously run-down areas. This project's findings are confirmed by recent figures showing that the average house price in London has surged past £500,000. This rise has been significant, partly due to the regeneration of previously underdeveloped areas, which have now become desirable places to live. However, the soaring house prices have also made it harder for many people to get on the property ladder and caused concerns about pricing young people out of the market. Despite the clear disparities between different areas of the city, the photographs also reveal that London's diversity and multiculturalism remain thriving characteristics. Parts of the city are known for their vibrant and bustling communities, with a range of shops, eateries, and cultural experiences on offer. In conclusion, the ten-year-long photography project offers a fascinating insight into the differences between various areas of London concerning economic prosperity and regeneration. While the average house price in the capital has gone up in the past ten years, there are still parts of the city that remain untouched by the financial crash, while other previously neglected areas have experienced significant rejuvenation. It's important to acknowledge the benefits of this urban regeneration but also to address the implications of the rising house prices and their impact on affordable housing in the city."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

Among the top essential traits of successful people, we find ambition, stability, classiness, open-mindedness, and patience. Each of these attributes plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve their goals and lead fulfilling lives. Ambition is the fuel that drives us forward. It provides the motivation we need to pursue our dreams and make our goals a reality. Without ambition, we would lack direction and purpose, and we would struggle to find meaning in our lives. That's why successful people are always pushing themselves to be better, to aim higher, and to achieve more. Stability is another crucial trait that successful people possess. They understand the importance of balance in their lives, and they work hard to maintain it. They have a stable foundation that supports them through both the good times and the bad. They are not easily swayed by external circumstances, and they can adapt to change while staying grounded. Classiness is a trait that sets successful people apart from others. They know how to comport themselves in any situation, and they are always respectful of others. They understand the value of decorum and etiquette, and they use it to navigate their personal and professional lives with ease. Open-mindedness is a vital trait that helps successful people maintain their edge. They are willing to consider new ideas and perspectives, and they are not afraid to challenge their own assumptions. They understand that innovation and progress rely on being open to change and new possibilities. Finally, patience is a virtue that successful people have in spades. They know that change takes time, and they are willing to put in the effort and wait for the results. They understand that success is not an overnight process and that setbacks and failures are part of the journey. They keep their eyes on the prize and stay committed to their goals despite the obstacles. In conclusion, being ambitious, stable, classy, open-minded, and patient are essential traits for success.

Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be eclectic.

Low costs and high availability brought in business from around the globe, and transformed India into one of the largest kidney transplant centers in the world. However, several problems began to surface. In some cases, patients were unaware that a kidney transplant even took place. In other cases, patients were promised payments that were much higher than what they actually received. These and other ethical issues pushed the Indian government to pass legislation banning the sale of organs. Nevertheless, current laws still contain loopholes. For example, the THOA states that an organ donor must be a relative, spouse, or an individual donating for reasons of \`\`affection'' for the recipient. Often, claims of \`\`affection'' are unfounded and the organ donor has no connection to the recipient. In many cases, the donor may not be Indian or even speak the same language as the recipient.

Many people struggle with peeling garlic cloves, which can be frustrating when you're in the middle of cooking a meal. However, there's a simple trick that can make peeling garlic a breeze - and all you need is a knife. To peel a garlic clove using a knife, start by placing the garlic clove on a cutting board with the flat side facing down. Take a sturdy kitchen knife and use the flat side to press down firmly on the top of the clove. You don't need to use a lot of force, but make sure that you press down enough to break the skin of the garlic clove. Next, use your hands to gently remove the skin from the garlic clove. You should find that the skin slips off easily now that it has been loosened by the knife. If there are any small pieces of skin left on the garlic, you can remove them using the tip of the knife. Not only is this trick a simple way to peel garlic, but it's also much faster than trying to peel each clove individually. You can use this technique to peel multiple cloves at once, which is a huge time saver when you're cooking for a crowd. There are a few other benefits to using a knife to peel garlic cloves. For one, it's much less messy than attempting to peel garlic by hand. When you use your fingers to peel garlic, you're likely to end up with sticky garlic juice all over your hands. This can be difficult to wash off and can leave your hands smelling like garlic for hours. Another benefit to using a knife is that it can be easier on your wrists. Peeling a lot of garlic cloves by hand can be tiring on your hands and wrists, but using a knife allows you to use different muscles and may be less fatiguing. In conclusion, if you're looking for an easy and fast way to peel garlic, using a knife is a great option. By pressing the flat side of a sturdy knife onto the garlic clove, you can loosen the skin and make peeling a breeze. Give it a try the next time you're cooking with garlic and see how much time and effort it can save you!"},{"instruction":"The world #39;s top telecoms equipment makers may have to settle for just a fraction of the multibilliondollar orders they had expected when China builds its nextgeneration mobile phone networks.

In some cases, it can set the tone for the rest of the game, giving one team a lead that they can build on or forcing the other team to play catch-up. But who threw the first touchdown pass of the game? The answer to this question varies from game to game, and it can be difficult to determine without further information. If you're watching the game on television, the announcers will typically provide this information shortly after the touchdown is scored. They may also provide a replay of the play, so you can see exactly who threw the pass and who caught it. If you're not watching the game on television, you may need to do some research to find out who threw the first touchdown pass of the game. You can search online for a recap of the game, which should include information about the scoring plays. You can also check the box score, which should list the players who contributed to each touchdown. Whether you're watching the game live or catching up on the highlights later, knowing who threw the first touchdown pass of the game can be a exciting piece of information. It gives you a sense of which players are performing well and which teams are likely to come out on top.

Use the straight thumbs technique.","output":"When it comes to gripping a golf club, there are a variety of techniques that can be used. One technique that has gained popularity in recent years is the thumb-over-thumb grip. The thumb-over-thumb grip involves placing the thumbs directly on top of the grip, with the left thumb slightly overlapping the right. This creates a secure hold on the club, as the thumbs are able to exert pressure and prevent the club from slipping during the swing. Another grip technique that can be used is the straight thumbs technique. This involves keeping the thumbs straight down the shaft of the club, rather than overlapping each other. This allows for a more natural wrist hinge during the swing, which can lead to more power and accuracy. Both of these grip techniques are worth trying out to see which feels most comfortable and effective for your swing. It's important to experiment with different grips and find the one that works best for you. So, if you're looking to up your golf game, consider trying a thumb-over-thumb grip or the straight thumbs technique.

In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by JeanBaptiste de Lamarck, who called the Vermes une espèce de chaos (a sort of chaos) and split the group into three new phyla, worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had 4 phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps, and infusorians.

Add enough water to turn the aspirin into a smooth paste. Add some honey and mix well. Apply the mixture on your face and wait 7 to 15 minutes. Wash your face with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a towel.","output":"Article Title: DIY Aspirin and Honey Face Mask The pursuit of clear and radiant skin has been a common goal for many individuals. One effective way to achieve this is through the use of face masks. Nowadays, face masks are readily available in the market, but they can be quite pricey. If you're looking for a more affordable option, you might want to try making your very own face mask using aspirin and honey. Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a common pain reliever that is readily available in drugstores. However, what many people might not know is that aspirin is also great for our skin. It contains salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid that can help exfoliate the skin and remove dead skin cells, dirt, and oil. Honey, on the other hand, is a natural humectant that can help keep the skin moisturized while also having antibacterial properties that can help prevent acne. To create the aspirin and honey face mask, you'll need to crush up some aspirin tablets until they become a fine powder. Next, mix them into a bowl with enough water to create a smooth paste. Once you've got a smooth consistency, add in some honey and mix well. Apply the mixture onto your face, making sure to avoid getting it into your eyes. Leave it on for 7 to 15 minutes to allow the ingredients to work their magic. As the mask dries, you might feel a tightening sensation on your skin, which is completely normal. After the time is up, wash your face with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a towel. You might notice your skin is smoother and looks brighter. This is because the salicylic acid in aspirin helps exfoliate your skin, while the honey soothes and moisturizes it. It's important to note that this DIY face mask may not be suitable for every skin type. If you have sensitive skin, it's best to do a patch test first to see how your skin reacts. Also, remember to use this face mask in moderation, no more than once a week, as over-exfoliation can cause irritation. In conclusion, creating your own face mask using aspirin and honey is a cost-effective and natural way to achieve glowing, healthy-looking skin. Try it out for yourself and see how it works for you!"},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Rubin, a sole practitioner in Tucson, says the foundation has quietly done a fabulous job at legal services and civics instruction.

A garden needs sunlight to thrive, and a well-selected location can provide the right conditions for plants to grow optimally. Additionally, having few weeds means that plants can receive the sufficient nutrients and resources they need without having to compete with other unwanted plants. To ensure the success of a garden, it is crucial to choose a site that receives full sunlight for at least six hours a day. Plants rely on sunlight to photosynthesize, a process that allows them to produce food and grow. Without sunlight, plants can suffer from stunted growth or even die. Therefore, if a garden is created in a shaded area, it is unlikely to flourish and may require additional care and attention. Once a garden location with full sunlight has been selected, it is equally important to ensure that the site is relatively weed-free. Weeds compete with plants for nutrients, water, and space, which can significantly hinder their growth. In addition, weeds can also provide shelter to pests, which can later attack and damage garden plants. Removing weeds from a garden can be a time-consuming task, but there are several tips that can help simplify the process. First, it is recommended to remove the roots of the weeds to prevent them from re-growing. This can be achieved by digging around the weed with a tool or by using a herbicide. Moreover, performing regular maintenance of the garden, such as weeding and applying a layer of mulch, can help keep weeds at bay. In conclusion, finding an area that receives full sunlight and has few weeds is crucial for anyone looking to create a successful garden. By selecting the right location and taking steps to prevent weed growth, gardeners can give their plants the best possible conditions in which to grow and thrive. With the right care and attention, a well-placed garden can provide a beautiful and bountiful harvest for years to come."},{"instruction":"From the following options, what is the question Which of the Seven Dwarfs comes first alphabetically ? asking about?

The footage shows the confused dog chasing after the car, desperate not to be left alone. The inconsiderate driver of the car didn't care about the puppy's welfare and left it there as if it were merely junk. It was a despicable act that left the animal all alone. Thankfully, the RSPCA centre was able to rescue the puppy, and it is currently being taken care of as it awaits a loving family to rehome it.

The RSPCA, which has faced many such cases of abandonment, calls for better enforcement of animal welfare laws and stiffer penalties for those caught in the act. It's essential to remember that owning a pet is a responsibility, not a leisure activity, and it's necessary to show kindness and compassion to any creatures we choose to take into our care. Meanwhile, the puppy has suffered a traumatic experience, but with supportive care, we are hopeful that it will make a full recovery and live a long and happy life with a new family.

Abramovich, the owner of Premier League club Chelsea, had held the top spot for many years but now falls to second place with a net worth of £9.8bn. The top 20 has seen a number of changes with new faces appearing as well as old players dropping out. Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov rose two places to third with an estimated net worth of £9.4bn. But despite the changes at the top, some things remain the same. AC Milan's on-loan England midfielder David Beckham remains the richest player in the sport with an estimated net worth of £165m. The report was compiled by finance specialists Wealth-X, who analyse the net worth of the world's ultra-high individuals. According to the report, the ultra-high net worth individuals in the football industry increased by 14% in the last year. It is interesting to note that six of the top 20 individuals are of Middle Eastern heritage, highlighting the growing influence of the region in football. Sheikh Mansour's ownership of Manchester City has seen the club rise to the top of the English game, winning four Premier League titles in the last eight years. Despite Abramovich's recent acquisition of the world's most expensive yacht, his net worth has fallen by over £2bn since last year. This may be due, in part, to Chelsea's failure to qualify for this year's Champions League. In conclusion, football remains a lucrative industry for those at the top with the ultra-high net worth individuals increasing year-on-year. Despite the changes at the top of the football rich list, some things remain the same, with David Beckham retaining his position as the richest player in the sport."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve 144 = 36*j 288 for j.

The ad features customers and staff getting ready to celebrate the joyous season, with the finale being filmed in Wigan in response to a customer's tweet. The festive season is an important time for retailers, and Tesco is hoping that this ad goes some way to repairing their public image. Tesco has been struggling as of late, with falling sales and losing the ongoing price war with budget rivals. In addition to this, the supermarket is currently under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office for allegedly inflating profits, which led to hundreds of millions of pounds being wiped off their stock price.

Despite the challenges that Tesco is facing, the supermarket is hoping to turn things around and regain the trust of their customers. The festive season advertisement is just one step towards achieving this.

While it's often seen as a negative emotion, it can actually be a powerful tool for making positive shifts in our lives. If channeled in the right way, anger can be a motivator for change and growth. One of the first steps to using anger in a positive way is to get to work. Instead of stewing in your anger and letting it fester, take action to address the issue that's causing your anger. This could involve having a difficult conversation, setting boundaries or taking steps to change your situation. It's also important to let yourself be emotional periodically. Holding in your anger and emotions can be detrimental to your mental health, so give yourself permission to feel and express your anger in a safe and healthy way. This could involve talking things through with a trusted friend or therapist, journaling or simply allowing yourself to cry or yell if needed. Getting physical can also be a helpful way to channel your anger. Exercise releases endorphins which can help to elevate your mood and reduce tension. Activities such as running, boxing or yoga can help you to channel your anger in a positive way and release any pent-up frustration. It's important to avoid self-destructive anger management techniques such as substance abuse or lashing out at others. These behaviors may provide temporary relief but they will ultimately create more harm than good. Finally, it's important to understand how anger affects your physical and emotional health. Prolonged anger can have negative effects on your heart, immune system, and overall well-being. By learning how anger affects you, you can take steps to manage it in a healthy way. In conclusion, while anger can be a challenging emotion to deal with, it can also be a powerful tool for making positive changes in our lives. By taking steps to channel our anger positively, we can turn it into a catalyst for growth and transformation."},{"instruction":"With a Queensland state election coming up in Australia, many minor parties and independents will be looking to hold balance of power and making the major parties listen to what they have to say.

Tongo claimed that he had installed locks to prevent murder victim Anni Dewani from escaping. Anni Dewani was just 28 years old when her body was found in Tongo's abandoned shuttle taxi. Tongo's testimony sheds further light on the tragic events surrounding the murder of Anni Dewani. It appears that she was not only the victim of a violent crime, but also had her freedom of movement severely restricted. The details of Tongo's testimony suggest a shocking degree of premeditation on the part of whoever was responsible for Anni's death. The trial of Shrien Dewani has been closely watched both in South Africa and around the world. Dewani, who is British, was accused of arranging the murder of his wife during their honeymoon in 2010. After a lengthy legal battle, he was eventually extradited to South Africa to stand trial. Throughout the trial, there have been conflicting accounts of what happened, with different witnesses offering different versions of events. Tongo's testimony, however, is among the most damning yet. If his claims are true, they suggest that Anni Dewani was the victim of a brutal and premeditated crime that was designed to prevent her from escaping. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the death of Anni Dewani is a tragedy that has affected many people around the world. Her family and friends will no doubt be hoping for a just resolution to this long and painful legal process. For their sake, and for the sake of justice, it is important that the full truth about what happened is uncovered."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: attraction, protect, wall","output":"The high wall was built to protect the castle from unwanted visitors, but it also had an unintended effect of increasing the attraction of the fortress to curious onlookers."},{"instruction":"Why do some people prefer Linux over Windows?

As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and northwest of the Harz mountains, so that eastwest traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.

Change medications.","output":"Massage, Rest, and Medications: Coping with Muscle Twitches Muscle twitches, also known as fasciculations, are spontaneous contractions of muscle fibers that can be quite annoying and distressing. While they are usually harmless and resolve on their own, they can be a sign of underlying health issues, such as anxiety, fatigue, dehydration, or nerve damage. Fortunately, there are several ways to cope with muscle twitches and minimize their impact on your daily life. Massage therapy is a popular and effective method to alleviate muscle tension and spasms, including twitches. By applying pressure and manipulation techniques to your muscles, a licensed massage therapist can increase blood flow, reduce inflammation, and enhance relaxation. Studies have shown that massage therapy can ease muscle pain and stiffness, improve range of motion and flexibility, and boost mood and sleep quality. Regular massage sessions may also help prevent muscle spasms from occurring in the first place. Rest and sleep are crucial for your body to repair and regenerate damaged tissues and cells, including those involved in muscle function. Lack of sleep and rest can lead to fatigue, stress, and anxiety, which can trigger or worsen muscle twitches. Therefore, it is recommended that you get at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night and take breaks throughout the day if your work involves prolonged sitting or standing. You can also try relaxation techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga, to calm your mind and release tension from your muscles. Stimulant substances, such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, can overstimulate your nervous system and exacerbate muscle twitches. Therefore, it is advisable to minimize your intake of these substances or avoid them altogether if possible. You can opt for natural alternatives, such as herbal teas, water, or fruit juices, to keep yourself hydrated and energized. Muscle twitches can be triggered or worsened by certain medications, such as diuretics, corticosteroids, or antipsychotics. If you are experiencing unwanted twitches or other side effects from your medication, you should consult your doctor and discuss the possibility of changing your prescription or dosage. Do not stop or alter your medication without medical supervision. In conclusion, muscle twitches can be an annoying and uncomfortable experience, but they can also be managed and prevented with the right strategies. Massage, rest, hydration, and medication adjustments are some of the effective ways to reduce muscle tension and spasms and improve your overall quality of life. Always consult your healthcare provider before trying new treatments or discontinuing existing ones."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: what's the population of kangaroos in australia?","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot provide the exact population of kangaroos in Australia as it constantly changes due to various factors.
