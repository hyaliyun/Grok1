Report any issues you have with an order with the site’s support page.","output":"When it comes to selling items online, there are a few precautions that you can take to protect both yourself and your buyers. First of all, if a buyer places an unusually large or expensive order, it is wise to communicate with them directly. This can help you to establish a relationship with the buyer and ensure that they are a legitimate customer. It is also important to take detailed pictures of your items before shipping them out. This can help to avoid false damage claims from buyers who might try to scam you. With good quality pictures, you can show the condition of the item before it was shipped and avoid any disputes if the item arrives damaged. Another important step is to get shipping insurance to cover any damage that might occur during transit. While this might cost a bit extra, it can save you a lot in the long run if something goes wrong during shipping. If you are selling items on sites like Craigslist or Facebook, it is best to stick with local buyers whenever possible. This can help to avoid any scams or frauds associated with shipping. It is also recommended to meet at a public place if you are buying or selling an item locally. This can provide a safer environment for both parties involved. Before making payment for an item, it's important to check the quality of the item if possible. This can help to ensure that you are receiving what you are paying for. Lastly, if you encounter any issues with an order, it is important to report them to the site’s support page. This can help to rectify the situation and protect both the buyer and the seller.

One easy way to do this is by taking a cutting from an established rosemary plant and planting it to create a new seedling. To start, select a healthy rosemary plant from which to take your cutting. Use a sharp and clean pair of shears or scissors to cut a stem that's at least several inches long--shorter cuttings may not have enough material to root successfully. Strip away the leaves from the bottom inch of the stem to create a bare section that will be submerged in water. Fill a glass or jar with water and place the stripped stem inside so that the bare section is submerged in the water. Change the water every few days to prevent bacteria buildup and ensure that the cutting stays healthy. After a few weeks, you should start seeing roots emerging from the bare section of the stem. Once the roots are at least an inch long, you can carefully remove the cutting from the water and pot it up in a small container of soil. Be sure to keep the soil moist and in a sunny location--rosemary likes plenty of sunlight and well-draining soil. As your new seedling grows, you can transplant it into a larger pot or even into your garden if you have a sunny, well-draining spot for it. With care and attention, your propagated rosemary plant will thrive and provide you with plenty of delicious and aromatic herb for cooking and flavoring.

During his career, he made some impressive kicks, and many fans often wonder about the lengths of his kicks. In particular, one question that comes to mind is how many yards longer his second field goal was compared to his first. In a game against the Arizona Cardinals on September 10th, 2007, Joe Nedney made two field goals. The first kick was in the first quarter, and it was from 20 yards away. The second kick was in the second quarter, and it was from a further distance of 49 yards. To find out how many yards longer Nedney's second field goal was compared to his first, we need to subtract the distance of the first kick from that of the second kick. Doing the math, we get: 49 yards - 20 yards = 29 yards Therefore, Joe Nedney's second field goal in the game against the Arizona Cardinals was 29 yards longer than his first. While this may not be his longest field goal, fans can appreciate the great kicker's consistent ability to perform even under pressure. It is impressive to see how much further he was able to successfully kick the ball in just the span of one quarter.

While the news has been celebrated in many parts of the world, it has caused concern amongst some who fear that the win could lead to a longer prison term for Xiaobo. Many were surprised when Xiaobo was named the winner of the prestigious award, including his wife who reportedly said, \\"I’ve never dreamed about this.\\" Xiaobo was awarded the prize for his long-standing human rights advocacy work in China, where he has been particularly vocal about political reform and freedom of speech. However, his activism has not gone unnoticed by the Chinese government, and his imprisonment is seen by many as a result of his outspoken views. In fact, as news of the Nobel Peace Prize announcement broke, CNN was blacked out in China, leading to speculation that the Chinese government was attempting to censor coverage of the story. Legal experts are also worried that the Nobel win could lead to a longer prison sentence for Xiaobo. His lawyer has spoken out, arguing that the government may be angered by the international attention and may seek to make an example of Xiaobo by increasing his sentence. Despite the controversy surrounding the award, many are pleased to see Xiaobo’s activism recognized on an international level. Human rights groups have applauded the Nobel committee's decision, noting that Xiaobo’s work has been instrumental in shining a light on the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. It remains to be seen what impact the Nobel Prize will have on Xiaobo’s future, but for now, the award stands as a powerful reminder of the importance of advocating for human rights and fighting for justice around the world."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: A Fortress of Grey Ice, author, J.

This perception is not surprising, considering that more germs can be found on a £1 coin than on a toilet seat. However, only one out of five Europeans wash their hands after handling money. The study also found that men are more likely to avoid cleaning their hands than women. In addition, Britons are the worst in Europe for not washing their hands after handling coins or notes.

It is important to raise awareness about the significance of hand hygiene, particularly when handling money. Effective hand washing with soap and water can reduce the risk of infections caused by harmful bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. As we continue to navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, proper hand hygiene has become even more crucial. The virus can survive on surfaces, including money, for several hours or even days. To protect ourselves and those around us, we must make a conscious effort to wash our hands regularly and thoroughly, especially after handling money.

The wars of Antiochus III brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198 and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute. Antiochus IV Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169 BCE after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence.

Miller also mentions that they both have permission to say anything, and they know each other's fragile places. This reveals that they have strong communication skills and are not afraid to be vulnerable with each other. This is significant because being honest and open in a friendship can strengthen the bond and help avoid misunderstandings.

Pupquest's mission is to halt the operation of puppy mills and support responsible breeders who care for their animals' well-being. While online resources can be useful, it is important to remember that not all breeders listed on these websites may be reputable. It is essential to do your research and ask potential breeders important questions to ensure that they are following ethical breeding practices. Before considering any breeder, you should ask to see health certificates of the parents and puppies, the vaccination records of the puppies, and evidence of genetic testing to ensure that both parents are free from any inherited diseases or conditions. In conclusion, getting a referral or utilizing online resources can help you find a reputable breeder when looking for a new furry friend. However, it is essential to research potential breeders thoroughly and ask vital questions to ensure you find a healthy and happy companion."},{"instruction":"Next question: when did ms dhoni join indian cricket team?","output":"MS Dhoni joined the Indian cricket team in December 2004."},{"instruction":"Are these paraphrases?

This represents an increase from the 14,164 reported in 2014, meaning that there were 1,532 more criminal homicides in 2015 than in the previous year. The increase in criminal homicides in 2015 was particularly pronounced in certain cities and regions of the country. Chicago, for example, saw a jump in its homicide rate, with 478 homicides in 2015 compared to 416 in 2014. Similarly, Baltimore saw a significant increase in its homicide rate, with 344 homicides in 2015 compared to 211 in 2014. There are various factors that may have contributed to the increase in criminal homicides in 2015. Some experts have pointed to the rise in gang violence and drug-related crimes as contributing factors, while others have suggested that cuts to police budgets and staffing may have made it more difficult for law enforcement to prevent and solve homicides. Regardless of the underlying causes, the increase in criminal homicides in 2015 is a significant concern for law enforcement agencies and policymakers across the country. Efforts to reduce the number of homicides will require a multifaceted approach, including increased funding for law enforcement, community-based interventions to address the root causes of crime, and more effective criminal justice policies to prevent recidivism and keep violent offenders off the streets."},{"instruction":"Elizabeth Jane Watson (December 28, 1921 – February 21, 2016) was an American actress and singer known for her roles in musical theatre, especially Laurey in Oklahoma!, creating the role in the London premiere.

The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broadspectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance).

One piece of advice that is often given is to let the other person make the first move in terms of communication. If you find yourself constantly checking your phone and waiting for a text or call from someone you're interested in, it may be time to take a step back and wait for them to reach out to you first. This can be a challenging thing to do, but it allows you to gauge the other person's interest and prevent yourself from coming across as too needy or desperate. Another valuable piece of advice is to ask for advice. If you're unsure about how to approach a situation or how someone is feeling, reach out to a trusted friend or family member for their thoughts. Sometimes getting an outside perspective can help you see things more clearly and avoid potential misinterpretations. When it comes to communicating with the person you're interested in, asking them directly about their thoughts and feelings can be intimidating, but it's often the best approach. Communication is key in any relationship, and being open and honest from the start can set the foundation for a healthy and fulfilling partnership. Taking care of yourself is another crucial aspect of any relationship. This means setting boundaries, prioritizing your own needs and desires, and not settling for less than what you deserve. It's essential to recognize your own value and importance in any relationship and not compromise on things that are important to you. Above all, maintaining your dignity is paramount. Avoid begging or pleading for someone's attention or affection and don't compromise your values or beliefs to please the other person. Remember that you are worthy of love and respect and don't settle for anything less. By following these simple guidelines, you can set yourself up for success in any relationship and lay the groundwork for a happy and fulfilling future."},{"instruction":"Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Whether it's a chance to try something new or pursue a new career path, being open to these possibilities can lead to great success and happiness. However, it's also important to be mindful of which opportunities are worth pursuing. Not every opportunity that comes our way will be a good fit for us, and it's important to evaluate each one carefully before diving in. One way to stay aware of potential opportunities is to always be open to new experiences and situations. This includes trying new things, meeting new people, and exploring different paths in life. By staying curious and open-minded, we can increase the chances of stumbling upon a valuable opportunity. Additionally, it's important to have a clear understanding of our goals and values when evaluating potential opportunities. If an opportunity aligns with our values and will help us reach our goals, it's likely worth pursuing. On the other hand, if an opportunity doesn't align with our values or takes us further away from our goals, it may be best to pass it up.

However, not everybody is blessed with natural curls, and that's where a curling iron comes in handy. If you're interested in getting curls, here are some simple steps to follow: 1. Begin with dry hair. It's important to ensure that your hair isn't damp before using a curling iron, which can cause heat damage and may not give you the desired results. 2. Comb out the tangles. Use a wide-toothed comb to gently comb out any tangles in your hair to ensure that it's smooth and ready for curling. 3. Apply a setting spray or hairspray to your hair. This protects your hair from heat damage and also helps hold the curls in their shape. 4. Use a curling iron with a barrel between ¾ inches and 1 inch. This is the ideal size for creating curls that look bouncy, natural and not too tight. 5. Curl 1-inch sections at a time. Take a small section of hair that is about an inch wide and clamp it with the curling iron. Roll the iron up carefully, holding it vertically, and hold it for around ten seconds. Be sure not to leave the hair in for too long, as your hair may be damaged. 6. Pin up each curl as you go. Once you've finished curling a section of hair, take the curl gently, roll it up with your fingers and pin it up. Continue doing the same for other sections of hair until you've curled all parts of your hair. 7. Alternate the size and direction of each curl. This gives your curls a natural and bouncy look. Do not curl all the sections in the same direction. 8. Spritz your curls with hairspray. This will help keep the curls in their shape for longer. 9. Unpin the curls. Once you've finished spritzing your hair with hairspray, unpin all the curls. 10. Shape the curls with your fingers. Use your fingers to gently run through your hair to shape and move the curls around so that they have a natural flow. In conclusion, getting perfect curls with a curling iron is quite simple, especially when you follow these tips diligently. Ensure that you take your hair's health into consideration and avoid applying too much heat and sprays. With practice, your curling skills will improve, and you'll be able to achieve the perfect curls that suit your preference."},{"instruction":"the premise Two children, running toward the photographer, with a dilapidated tents in the background. true if Two kids are sitting playing with toys indoors.?

The vote, which was scheduled for November 9th, has been the subject of nationwide debate for years. The Spanish government filed a lawsuit claiming that the referendum would be unconstitutional, which the court ultimately sided with. Catalonia, a wealthy region in northeastern Spain, has long pushed for independence from the rest of the country. The Catalonia government has argued that independence would allow the region greater control over its economy and politics. However, Spain's government sees Catalonia's push for independence as a threat to the unity of the nation. Despite the court's decision, many Catalonians remain determined to hold their referendum. Pro-independence activists have organized protests and rallies throughout the region, arguing that the Spanish government is denying them their democratic rights. The court's decision to suspend the referendum highlights the ongoing political tensions in Spain. Many Catalonians feel that their region has been ignored by the federal government, and they view the referendum as a way to voice their opinions. While the court's decision is a setback for Catalonia's independence movement, it is not the end of the battle.

The Ottoman Parliament was initially suspended in 1878 by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, who had grown wary of the growing power of the parliament and feared losing his absolute rule. The suspension of the parliament was met with opposition from various political groups, including the Young Turks, who saw the parliament as a crucial institution for the modernization and democratization of the Ottoman Empire. After years of organizing and mobilizing, the Young Turks launched a successful revolution in 1908, which resulted in the reinstatement of the Ottoman Parliament and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. This revolution is known as the Young Turk Revolution and was hailed as a watershed moment in the history of the Ottoman Empire. The Young Turks were able to gain popular support for their cause by advocating for a modern, secular, and democratic government. They also championed the rights of minorities, such as Armenians and Jews, in the Ottoman Empire.

However, based on a general analysis of NFL games, the average shortest touchdown pass is around 1-5 yards, while the longest touchdown pass can reach up to 80-90 yards. It's important to note that there have been some exceptional cases in NFL history where the longest touchdown pass was significantly longer than the shortest. For example, in 1950, Johnny Lujack threw a 98-yard touchdown pass for the Chicago Bears while Ed Sprinkle threw a 2-yard touchdown pass in the same game. This makes the difference between the longest and shortest touchdown pass in that game an impressive 96 yards. Similarly, in a 2012 game between the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons, Atlantas's Matt Ryan delivered an 85-yard touchdown pass to Roddy White, while Carolina's Cam Newton completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to Greg Olsen in the same game. This results in a 84-yard difference between the longest and shortest touchdown pass. In conclusion, the difference between the longest and shortest touchdown pass can vary greatly and largely depends on game situational factors. However, based on historical data, it is not uncommon for the difference to be around 80-90 yards with particularly exceptional cases exceeding 90 yards."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...who plays michael's nephew on the office??","output":"Jake Lacy played Michael's nephew on The Office."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...who plays doc brown in back to the future??","output":"Christopher Lloyd."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

Slimes spawn in caves located in slime chunks, which are 16 x 16 x 16 block areas. You have a one in ten chance of coming across a slime chunk. When below layer 40, slimes can spawn in any light situation; adding torches will both make mining easier and prevent other hostile mobs from appearing. This constitutes a chunk. Slimes won't start spawning immediately while you're here, but you may be able to force them to do so by adding platforms. These platforms should be stacked on top of each other with three blocks of vertical space between each. Having these platforms increases the possible spawn area for slimes. As with the swamp biome, slimes won't spawn if you're 24 blocks (or closer) away from the spawn area. If you don't see any slimes within a standard night and day cycle, you'll need to find a new cave.

Listen to their response carefully and try to accommodate their needs as best you can. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. Next, it is essential to acknowledge the loss or pain they are experiencing. Let them know that their feelings are perfectly valid and understandable. Often, people want to move on quickly from difficult situations, but it's important to allow them time to process their emotions at their own pace. It can also be helpful to talk to their family and friends to ensure they have the necessary support systems in place. This can range from simple acts of kindness, such as cooking meals or helping with errands, to providing emotional support. If you feel that counseling may be useful, it's vital to approach the subject gently. Be mindful not to make assumptions or suggest that the person is not coping well. Instead, frame the counseling as an option that could be beneficial in helping them. Finally, try to avoid well-intentioned but unhelpful statements. Platitudes such as \\"time heals all wounds\\" or \\"everything happens for a reason\\" can often feel dismissive and offer little comfort.

Whether you’re trying to cool down a stuffy room or looking for a refreshing blast on a hot summer day, finding a cold air source can make all the difference. One simple way to access cold air is to utilize your home’s air conditioning system. If you have central air conditioning, adjust the thermostat to a cooler temperature and wait for the air to start flowing. If you don’t have central air, use a window-mounted air conditioning unit or a portable air conditioner. These devices can be very effective at cooling small spaces quickly. Another option for finding a cold air source is to seek out natural cold spots in your home. This can include a basement, a tiled bathroom or a room with large windows that face north. These areas tend to retain cooler temperatures, and can be a welcome refuge on hot days. You can also try opening windows during cooler parts of the day like early morning or late night to let in fresh cooler air. For outdoor relief, you can head to a shady area or look for a breeze to cool you down. If you’re near water, try dipping your feet in for an instant cooling effect. You can also invest in a personal fan or misting spray to create a cool, refreshing breeze. Remember, staying cool in hot weather is important for your health and comfort.

Bironas' average field goal distance is approximately 38 yards. So 239 field goals by 38 yards equals 9,082 total yards of field goals made by Bironas. To find out the difference between the two, we subtract Bironas' 9,082 total yards of field goals from Janikowski's 17,440 total yards of field goals.

These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal.

Depending on the league, there may have been different players who scored the last goals in these crucial matches. In the NHL, one of the most famous recent game 7s was the Stanley Cup Final in 2019 between the Boston Bruins and the St. Louis Blues. In that game, the last two regulation goals were scored by Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly and Bruins forward Jake DeBrusk. O'Reilly scored at the 10:38 mark of the third period to put the Blues up 3-0, while DeBrusk scored just over a minute later to cut the lead to 3-1. The game ultimately ended with a 4-1 victory for the Blues, securing their franchise's first Stanley Cup. In the NBA, one of the most memorable game 7s in recent history was the 2016 Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors. In that game, the last two regulation goals were scored by Cavaliers forward Kyrie Irving and Warriors forward Andre Iguodala. Irving hit a clutch three-pointer with 0:53 remaining to give the Cavs a 92-89 lead, but Iguodala responded with a layup to cut the lead to 92-91 with 0:30 remaining. The game ultimately ended with a 93-89 victory for the Cavaliers, securing their first NBA championship in franchise history. In MLB, a recent game 7 that stands out is the 2016 World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians. In that game, the last two regulation runs were scored by Cubs outfielder Ben Zobrist and Indians outfielder Rajai Davis. Zobrist hit a double in the top of the 10th inning to drive in what would be the game-winning run, while Davis hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth inning to tie the game at 6-6. The game ultimately ended with an 8-7 victory for the Cubs, securing their first World Series championship in over 100 years. In conclusion, depending on the league and the era, the last two players to score in regulation in game 7 can vary widely. However, some recent examples in the NHL, NBA, and MLB can give us a sense of the drama and excitement that can accompany these clutch moments in sports."},{"instruction":"Outstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre.

Note that in French, the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring bitumensoaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application.

Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19thcentury development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses. Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.

The city was founded as Maleth by the Phoenicians in around the 8th century BC, and it later became part of the Roman Empire under the name Melite. The ancient city was surrounded by walls, but very few remains of these have survived. The city walls were rebuilt a number of times, including by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century AD, the Arabs in around the 11th century, and the Kingdom of Sicily in the medieval period until the 15th century. Most of the extant fortifications were built by the Order of Saint John between the 16th and 18th centuries. The city has withstood a number of sieges, and it was defeated twice first by the Aghlabids in 870 and then by Maltese rebels in 1798. Today, the city walls are still intact except for some outworks, and they are among the best preserved fortifications in Malta.

The Teutonic Order was founded in the 12th century and reached the peak of its power in the 14th century, controlling vast territories in Eastern Europe. During this time, the order was led by a grandmaster who wielded immense political and military authority. Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye and Andreas von Stierland were both grandmasters of the Teutonic Order, but they did not hold the position at the same time. Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye was grandmaster from 1393 to 1407, while Andreas von Stierland was grandmaster from 1414 to 1441. Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye was born in Germany and joined the Teutonic Order as a young man. He served as the grand commander of Prussia before being elected as grandmaster. During his tenure, he successfully repelled several attacks by the Kingdom of Poland, which was expanding into Teutonic territory. He also oversaw the construction of several major fortifications, including the castle at Marienburg. Andreas von Stierland was also a German-born Teutonic knight who rose through the ranks of the order before being elected grandmaster. His tenure was marked by conflict with the Kingdom of Poland, which culminated in the Grunwald/Hanibal's battle in 1410. The Teutonic Order suffered a crushing defeat in this battle, which led to a long period of decline. In conclusion, both Wennemar Hasenkamp von Brüggeneye and Andreas von Stierland were important figures in the history of the Teutonic Order, serving as grandmasters at different times.

Nominal claims, which are claims made in name only without any official action, may have existed before any official territorial claims were made. However, it is also possible that territorial claims were made and then later recognized through formal treaties or agreements. In general, the Burmese have a long history of claiming territory along the coast of present-day Myanmar, including the Tenasserim coast. The first Burmese kingdom, the Pagan Empire, had trading connections with the region as early as the 11th century. Over the years, various Burmese kingdoms and dynasties have attempted to exert control over the region, often coming into conflict with the Thai and European colonizers who also sought to dominate the area. During the 19th century, the British Empire became the dominant colonial power in the region. They signed a treaty with the Burmese kingdom in 1826, which ceded control of Tenasserim to the British. This led to a series of conflicts and uprisings, as some Burmese leaders continued to resist British control. In summary, while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact timeline of claims made by the Burmese on the Tenasserim coast, it is clear that they have a long history of asserting their influence and control over the region. The idea of a nominal claim versus a territorial claim may not be useful in this context, as these claims were likely intertwined and fluctuated throughout history."},{"instruction":"Insects (from Latin insectum, a calque of Greek ἔντομον [éntomon], cut into sections) are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a threepart body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. a good answer to the question How many parts comprise the body of an insect?

It is essential to prioritize safety before charity, and one must consider the possible consequences of their actions before attempting dangerous stunts.

Dry the fabric with a shammy towel.","output":"If you want to keep your car's hood looking brand new, then it's important to know how to clean it properly. The steps are pretty straightforward, but it's important to follow them carefully for the best results. First, rinse the hood with water. This will help to remove any loose dirt or debris from the surface. Use a hose or a pressure washer if you have one, and make sure to spray the hood thoroughly, taking care to get all the corners and crevices. Next, you'll need to clean the fabric with auto shampoo. Choose a high-quality product that is specifically designed for automotive use, as this will give you the best results. Apply the shampoo to the fabric using a soft cloth or sponge, and work it into a lather. Make sure to cover the entire surface of the hood with the shampoo, and take your time to really work it in. After you've applied the shampoo, it's time to scrub the fabric with a stiff brush. This will help to remove deep stains and embedded dirt, so it's an important step. Choose a brush with bristles that are tough enough to remove stains, but not so tough that they'll damage the fabric. Use circular motions to scrub the hood, making sure to pay extra attention to any areas that are particularly stained or dirty. Finally, you'll need to dry the fabric with a shammy towel. This type of towel is great for drying automotive surfaces because it absorbs water quickly and leaves no streaks or residue behind. Use the towel to gently pat the fabric dry, taking care not to rub too hard or you could damage the fibers. And that's it! Following these steps will help you keep your car's hood looking great for years to come. Just remember to rinse, clean, scrub, and dry, and you'll have a hood that looks as good as new."},{"instruction":"Question: What is not the same between hand made and robotic amde mosaics?

If we consider the history of the National Football League (NFL), the player who holds the record for the longest touchdown pass is former Oakland Raiders quarterback, Rich Gannon. In a 2002 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Gannon threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice, setting the record for the longest touchdown pass in NFL history. However, if we consider all levels of football (professional and amateur), the answer to this question may be different. According to Guinness World Records, the longest touchdown pass ever thrown was by quarterback Devin Duron, who played for West Mesquite High School in Mesquite, Texas. In a 2014 game, Duron threw a 98-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver T.Q. Jackson. It is important to note that records such as these are constantly changing as players continue to push their limits on the field. While Gannon and Duron currently hold the records for the longest touchdown pass in their respective leagues, it is possible that another player may one day surpass their achievements.
