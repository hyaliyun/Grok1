Confine your golden retriever puppy when you can’t watch her. Reward your puppy when she pees or poops outside. Stay calm if you catch your puppy in the middle of an accident.","output":"House training your Golden Retriever puppy can be a challenging process, but it is also an essential part of their early development. It is crucial to start house training as early as possible, preferably when your puppy is around eight weeks old. At this age, puppies have better control of their bladder and bowel movements, making it easier for them to learn. Positive reinforcement and consistency are key to successful house training. Praise and treats after your puppy relieves themselves outside will encourage good behaviour. On the other hand, negative reactions will only confuse and discourage your puppy. A regular feeding schedule will also help with house training. If you feed your puppy at the same time each day, you can predict when they will need to go outside. Taking your puppy out at regular intervals will reduce accidents inside the house. A good rule of thumb is to take them outside before and after naps, playtime, and meals. Keeping a close eye on your puppy is critical during the training process. Supervision is necessary to prevent accidents from happening. If you can't watch your puppy, consider confining them to a small and comfortable space where they can still move around. A crate or a playpen are great options. When your puppy successfully relieves themselves outside, be sure to reward them with plenty of praise and their favourite treat. This positive reinforcement will help your puppy better understand what behaviour is expected of them. It is crucial not to punish your puppy for accidents. Puppies are still learning, and accidents are inevitable. Instead, clean up the mess promptly and stay calm when you catch your puppy mid-accident. In conclusion, house training your Golden Retriever puppy requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Start early, be observant, and follow a regular schedule. By providing a stable and positive environment for your puppy, you'll teach them good bathroom habits from the start."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just eleven players named in the starting lineups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.

Veteran New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond also sold for maximum 750,000.","output":"The Indian Premier League cricket series recently concluded its auction for the upcoming season, and it was notable that no Pakistan players were bought. This may be a reflection of the political tensions between India and Pakistan, but it is also indicative of the strict budget limitations placed on teams this year. Only 11 of the 66 players on offer were snapped up, as teams were forced to operate with a maximum budget of 750,000. One player who did fetch the full amount was West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard. Four teams bid for the dynamic performer, and his value was recognized by those who were able to spend big. Veteran New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond also sold for the maximum amount, demonstrating that quality will always find a way to attract interest. However, it is worrying that no Pakistani players were deemed worth the investment. Pakistan has a rich history of producing high-caliber cricketers, and their absence from the IPL only serves to highlight the ongoing political tensions between the two neighboring countries. It is important that sports remain separate from political disputes, and the decision not to include Pakistani players risks undermining the spirit of the IPL. In conclusion, while the IPL auction showed that quality will always carry value, it was also a stark reminder of broader political tensions. The absence of Pakistan players is a cause for concern and serves as a reminder that sports and politics should remain separate. Let us hope that future IPL auctions see a more diverse range of players, reflecting the true spirit of cricket as a global game."},{"instruction":"Sad day<br>Stacey always wanted to be a mom.

If you're looking for a paper that will give your printed materials a professional and high-quality look, heavy weight paper is a great option to consider. Heavy weight paper is exactly what it sounds like - a paper that is thicker and heavier than standard printer paper. This type of paper is great for things like business cards, brochures, and other marketing materials that you want to look and feel substantial. One advantage of heavy weight paper is that it is less likely to wrinkle, curl, or tear during the printing process. This can be especially important if you're printing a large batch of materials or if you're using a printer that tends to be finicky. Another benefit of heavy weight paper is that it can be ideal for printing graphics and images. The thicker paper stock allows for a better color saturation and sharper detail, resulting in a higher quality printed image. This can be especially important if you're printing something like a product catalog or a brochure that relies heavily on images to convey information. So, how do you choose the right heavy weight paper for your printing needs? One important factor to consider is the weight of the paper. Heavy weight paper typically ranges from around 100 to 300 grams per square meter (gsm), with higher gsm numbers indicating a thicker, heavier paper. For most purposes, a weight of 200 gsm or higher is recommended. Another consideration when choosing heavy weight paper is the finish. A matte finish can be a good choice if you want a more subtle, understated look for your printed materials. A glossy finish, on the other hand, can be great for making colors pop and adding a bit of shine to your marketing materials. Overall, heavy weight paper can be a great investment if you want to elevate the look and feel of your printed materials. Just make sure to choose a paper that is appropriate for your specific printing needs and remember to adjust your printer settings accordingly to get the best results."},{"instruction":"Are the following two questions the same?

Oil it up again. Put your cast iron in the oven. Bake your cast iron.","output":"Cast iron is a popular cooking material due to its durability and heat retention capabilities. However, it requires regular maintenance to ensure its longevity. One vital step is to reseason the cast iron when necessary. This involves removing any burnt-on food or rust and applying a layer of new seasoning. A simple way to do this is by heating the cast iron and wiping it with vegetable oil. After cooking, it's essential to wash the cast iron with mild soap and a brush to remove any food particles. Avoid using harsh scouring pads or detergents as they can strip the seasoning. Once clean, dry the cast iron thoroughly. To keep the seasoning intact, it's crucial to oil up the cast iron after washing. This involves applying a small amount of vegetable oil or any other high-smoke-point oil and wiping off the excess with a paper towel. Finally, baking the cast iron in the oven can help to reinforce the seasoning. Preheat the oven to 350°F and place the cast iron upside down on the middle rack. Bake for one hour, then let it cool in the oven before removing.

Tics can be difficult to manage and control, often disrupting daily routines and causing embarrassment or discomfort. However, with the right approach and support, it is possible to learn how to suppress tics and improve overall quality of life. One important step is to identify the preemptive urge that triggers the tic. This may involve paying close attention to the body's sensations or signals just before the tic occurs. Once you understand these urges, you can work on suppressing the tic itself by engaging in a different behavior. This can be anything from squeezing a stress ball to taking deep breaths or using a relaxation technique. It's also important to work with a behavioral therapist who specializes in tic disorders. They can help you identify triggers, develop coping strategies, and provide support and guidance throughout the process. With their expertise, you can create a targeted treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and goals. Finally, it's important to be patient throughout the process. Learning to suppress tics takes time and consistent practice. Don't get discouraged if progress is slow or if setbacks occur.

The story is incomprehensible, the music is forgettable, and the CGI is uncanny and unsettling. The film follows a group of \\"jellicle\\" cats as they compete for a chance to ascend to the \\"heaviside layer\\", but this flimsy plot is merely a vehicle for a series of unrelated musical numbers that make no sense and are impossible to follow. The characters are all played by recognizable actors who are unrecognizable under layers of digital fur, and their singing and dancing is both over-the-top and underwhelming at the same time. While some may argue that the film is a campy, so-bad-it's-good experience, the reality is that it is a deeply unpleasant and uncomfortable watch. The decision to use CGI to create the cats instead of practical effects is a major misstep, resulting in characters that look like grotesque monstrosities instead of lovable felines. The film is also too long, suffering from pacing issues and an inability to stay focused on any one plot point. Ultimately, Cats is a movie that should never have been made.

Stand one metre away from the player with the ball if you are a defender. Follow the threesecond ball possession rule. Remain in your designated position zone. Keep the ball in bounds.","output":"Basketball is a game of strategy, teamwork and skill. To ensure fair play, there are several rules that must be followed by every player on the court. Here are some important rules that every basketball player should know: Firstly, when you have the ball, you must not move at all with it. This is called traveling, and it can result in a turnover, giving the ball to the other team. It’s important to pass the ball quickly to an open teammate, or shoot it into the basket if you’re in a good position. Secondly, each team must keep seven players on the court at all times. If a team has fewer than seven players, they will forfeit the game. This rule ensures that teams have an equal number of players, and that the game can continue without any unfair advantage. Thirdly, if you are a defender, you must stand one metre away from the player with the ball. This is known as the defending distance rule. If you get too close to the player with the ball, you risk getting a foul, which gives the other team free throws. Fourthly, the three-second ball possession rule states that a player cannot hold the ball for more than three seconds while closely guarded by an opponent. If a player fails to pass or shoot the ball before the three seconds are up, they will lose possession of the ball. Fifthly, each player must remain in their designated position zone. There are five positions in basketball: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Each player must play within their assigned zone, and cannot simply wander around the court wherever they please. Finally, players must keep the ball in bounds at all times. This means that the ball must stay within the sideline and baseline boundaries of the court. If a player touches the ball when it’s out of bounds, or steps out of bounds while holding the ball, the other team will gain possession of the ball.

The report has called for the resignation of the attorney general and the replacement of the police commissioner as a result of their alleged involvement in these illegal activities. The report, compiled by United Nations investigator Philip Alston, accuses security forces in Kenya of killing hundreds of men in a crackdown that took place in 2008. Alston’s investigation found that many of these killings were carried out by police death squads who received orders from senior officials within the government. The report has prompted widespread outrage and calls for action from human rights groups and the public alike. Many are now calling for those responsible for the deaths of innocent individuals to be held accountable for their actions. In response to the report, the government of Kenya has questioned Alston’s “approach, conduct, and method of work”.

However, there are a few important tips to keep in mind to make the most of your makeup application. First, be sure to finish with a dewy setting spray. This will help set your makeup in place and give your skin a glowing finish. When choosing a setting spray, be sure to choose one that is compatible with your skin type. If you have oily skin, look for a matte finish setting spray. If you have dry skin, opt for a dewy finish setting spray. Next, avoid touching your face. Touching your face can transfer oil and bacteria from your hands to your skin, which can lead to breakouts. If you do need to touch your face, be sure to wash your hands first. If you find that your makeup is starting to fade throughout the day, reapply your makeup as needed. Focus on areas that may have faded, such as your cheeks or eyelids. However, try not to overdo it. Applying too much makeup can make it look cakey and heavy.

However, the confirmation followed chaotic scenes in the Parliament on Sunday. The Tripoli government has been struggling to impose order in a country awash with weapons, and many Libyans are angry at the slow progress towards democratic stability and the worsening security situation. Mitig's confirmation comes at a time when Libya is facing numerous challenges, including political instability, economic difficulties, and growing security concerns. The country has been in a state of chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with various factions and groups vying for power and control. The confirmation process itself was marked by chaos and violence, with rival factions exchanging blows and throwing chairs. It is clear that there is still a significant amount of tension and division within the government, and it remains to be seen whether Mitig will be able to bring about any real change. One of the major challenges facing Mitig and his government is the issue of security. Libya is awash with weapons, and various armed groups and militias still maintain a significant amount of power and influence. These groups pose a threat not only to stability within Libya but also to neighboring countries in the region. The slow pace of democratic progress is also a cause for concern. It has been almost a decade since the overthrow of Gaddafi, and yet Libya's government remains mired in political infighting and division. Many Libyans are frustrated with the lack of progress and are calling for greater transparency and accountability. In conclusion, Ahmad Mitig's confirmation as prime minister is just the latest chapter in Libya's ongoing struggle for stability and democratic progress. While his appointment offers some hope for change, there are still numerous challenges that must be addressed if Libya is to achieve lasting peace and stability."},{"instruction":"Premise: Despite its name, the square has had a tumultuous history ' home to a busy guillotine in the Revolution and the site of the Germans' last foot­hold in Paris in 1944 ' and handles some aggressive traffic today.

Many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey. Others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything (examples: humans, leopards, dogs and alligators).

This is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium. Some predators specialize in certain classes of prey, not just single species. Some will switch to other prey (with varying degrees of success) when the preferred target is extremely scarce, and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible.[citation needed] What is the purpose of an evolutionary arms race?

Swap out your pistons for a higher compression ratio. Install more aggressive camshafts. Use headers to improve exhaust flow. Use a boost controller in turbocharged vehicles.","output":"Upgrading your engine's performance is an exciting process, but it can be overwhelming when you don't know where to start. Here are some modifications you can make to your engine to increase power and torque. First, consider installing a new throttle body. A larger throttle body can increase the flow of air into the engine, improving performance. This is especially effective when paired with other modifications, such as a cold air intake or upgraded exhaust system. Swapping out your pistons for ones with a higher compression ratio can also increase power. Higher compression ratios result in a stronger combustion process, which translates to more power. However, this modification requires precision and expertise, and should only be performed by a professional. Installing more aggressive camshafts is another way to improve performance. Camshafts control the opening and closing of the engine's valves, which affects the timing and duration of the combustion process. Upgrading to more aggressive camshafts can increase power and torque throughout the entire RPM range. To further improve exhaust flow, consider installing headers. Headers are designed to optimize exhaust flow out of the engine and into the exhaust system. This reduction in backpressure can improve performance and increase efficiency. For turbocharged vehicles, using a boost controller is an effective way to increase horsepower. A boost controller allows for more precise control over the amount of boost pressure the turbocharger produces. This can result in significant increases in power, especially when paired with other modifications. Upgrading your engine's performance is a great way to bring new life to your vehicle. However, it's important to make modifications responsibly and seek the guidance of a professional if necessary. By carefully selecting the right modifications for your vehicle, you can enjoy a noticeable increase in performance and overall driving experience."},{"instruction":"Text: The day is marked in London by the ceremony of Trooping the Colour, which is also known as the Queen's Birthday Parade.

For example, in the Super Bowl LIV (2020) between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, the 49ers were the first to score with a field goal in the first quarter. Similarly, in the 2019 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors, the Warriors scored the first points of the series with a layup. It is also worth noting that the first team to score does not necessarily guarantee a win. Many games have seen the initial point scorers lose due to a shift in momentum or strategic adjustments made by their opponents.

Called the bloomery process, it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron. By 800 BC, ironmaking technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. Pig iron, a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon, was being produced in China as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making castiron. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of pattern welding, around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomerysteel and castiron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove slag and impurities.

The group landed in the U.S. on January 2, 1880 in New York City, and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds. Ironically, this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias, which are also small, doublestrung instruments that resemble the mandolin. The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes. An Italian musician, Carlo Curti, hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the Original Spanish Students, counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins. The imitators' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States. Please answer a question about this article.

Social media weirdness favors villains, another analyst says. The little guy fighting injustice is often a folk hero in film and history, professor says. But Dorner's violence is unacceptable, says attorney who sued LAPD for racism.","output":"Christopher Dorner’s story has been a topic of discussion among many people. Some consider him a “superhero” and compare him to fictional characters like Django Unchained. Others have pointed out the oddity in social media’s response, where villains are often given more attention. Meanwhile, one professor argues that people often gravitate towards individuals who fight for justice, particularly those who are considered the underdog. However, while there are different perspectives on Christopher Dorner's actions, it is crucial to acknowledge the fact that his violence is unacceptable. An attorney who sued the LAPD for its history of racism has even expressed this position. It is easy to understand why some people may view Christopher Dorner as a hero. He was a former LAPD officer who was terminated from his job and had since been seeking justice. He wrote a manifesto detailing his experience with the LAPD and how it had affected him. In a world where people strive for justice and equality, it is not surprising that some have found inspiration in Dorner’s fight. Social media often becomes a platform for strange and unconventional takes on events. People all over the world weigh in, generating unique narratives that revolve around different interpretations. It is no different with Christopher Dorner. Some have taken to social media to describe him as a “folk hero,” while others have highlighted his violent nature. It is interesting to note how people throughout history have celebrated individuals who stand up against injustice, even if it means perpetrating acts of aggression. From Robin Hood to Che Guevara, many are celebrated for their acts of rebellion. However, it's critical to distinguish between lawful resistance and illegal behavior. Ultimately, while some may admire Christopher Dorner’s fight against injustice, his actions cannot be forgiven. Acts of violence can never be a justifiable means to an end. It is essential to look toward more peaceful, lawful, and constructive ways to solve systemic issues in our society."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: coast, grow, pool","output":"As I travel down the coast, I see how the plants grow near the edge of the pool."},{"instruction":"Data: name = The Mill, eatType = coffee shop, food = French, priceRange = less than £20, area = riverside, near = The Sorrento.

NO is produced in a narrow band of high cylinder temperatures and pressures.

Set in the 1910's, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her smalltown husband and family for the lure of the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions, and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre (a high school production, that is). Back in her old town she once again comes up against smallmindedness, and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, bewildered (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and exlover. The plot is nothing new but Sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions, with every frame carefully shot, and he is aided immeasurably by having Stanwyck as his leading lady.

Whether we have known someone for years or recently made a new friend, investing time and effort into the friendship is a must. One important aspect of keeping a friendship strong is to strive for one-on-one time. While group outings can be fun, they can also be a barrier to building a deeper connection with our friends. Scheduling one-on-one time where we can have meaningful conversations and engage in activities we both enjoy can promote a stronger bond. Getting personal is also a crucial element in building a lasting friendship. Sharing our thoughts, feelings, and experiences with our friends helps to create a deeper understanding and strengthens our connection. It can also help us provide meaningful support and advice to our friends when they need it. Communication is essential for any relationship, and it's crucial to make it a regular practice with our friends. Our busy lives can often make it difficult to stay in touch, but regularly checking in and updating each other on our lives can help us feel connected despite time and distance. Little things can go a long way in keeping a friendship strong. A small gesture like remembering a significant event or sending a surprise package can show our friends that we care and value them. It's these small actions that make friends feel appreciated and loved. Taking trips together provides an excellent opportunity to create new memories and deepen our friendship. Exploring new places, trying new things, and facing challenges together can be an adventure that we will remember for years to come. Lastly, it is essential to be patient when it comes to our friendships. Building a deep connection takes time, and we need to be willing to invest that time consistently. Through good times and bad, being there for our friends and being patient with the ebb and flow of the relationship can help build a strong, lasting friendship. In conclusion, keeping our friendships strong requires effort and commitment. Striving for one-on-one time, getting personal, communicating regularly, doing little things to show we care, taking trips together, and being patient are all crucial elements in building and maintaining a lasting bond with our friends."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: check rates and availability for any time hostel. then proceed to booking.","output":"Check rates and availability for Any Time Hostel.

The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards. Initially PCBs were designed manually by creating a photomask on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were laid out on the mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rubon dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with selfadhesive tape. Preprinted nonreproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copperclad boards. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. How is the term PCB used?","output":"The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards. 2.

Raise the cat's head.","output":"When it comes to providing medical attention to a cat, it's essential to understand the proper techniques to ensure their safety and comfort. Four critical steps include positioning the cat, immobilizing them, opening their mouth, and raising their head. Positioning the cat involves placing them on a stable surface to prevent any further injuries. This surface should be comfortable for the cat to lay on, and they should not feel stressed or anxious while there. Once you've positioned the cat, it's essential to immobilize them to keep them from moving around too much. You can use a towel or a blanket to wrap them up, ensuring that they do not scratch or bite during the examination. Next, you'll need to open the cat's mouth to ensure you can see any potential issues. You can use a small tool, such as a tongue depressor, to pry open their mouth gently. However, be cautious not to use too much force as this can hurt the cat or damage their teeth or gums. Finally, raising the cat's head will make it easier to examine their mouth and upper respiratory system, in particular, to identify any problems or abnormalities. Raising the head requires gently lifting their chin, taking care not to tilt it too far or push it back. In conclusion, positioning, immobilizing, opening the mouth, and raising the head are essential steps when examining a cat. These steps help ensure the cat's safety and make it easier for the vet or caregiver to examine and provide appropriate medical attention.

Nestlings are baby birds that are not yet able to leave the nest, while fledglings have left the nest and are learning to fly.

In many cases, the best thing to do is to leave the bird alone and let nature take its course.

Fish with spinnerbaits when you want to fish through quick cover. Fish with topwater lures in very shallow water. Fish with jigs when you want a very accurate feel on the line. Fish with plastic and rubber lures to imitate worms or lizards.","output":"When it comes to fishing, choosing the right lure can make all the difference. Different lures work best in different situations, and understanding which lure to use in which situation can help you to catch more fish. In this article, we'll take a closer look at five popular types of lures and the situations in which they work best. Crankbaits: When You Want to Cover a Lot of Water Crankbaits are a type of hard-bodied lure that is designed to imitate small fish or other prey. They typically have a lip or bill that causes them to dive down and then swim back up to the surface when retrieved. This diving action makes them effective for covering a lot of water quickly, making them a good choice when you're trying to locate fish in a large area. Crankbaits are also effective for fishing along drop-offs or other underwater structure. Spinnerbaits: When You Want to Fish Through Quick Cover Spinnerbaits are another type of hard-bodied lure, but they typically have a rotating blade that creates a lot of vibration and flash when retrieved. They are effective for fishing through quick cover such as weeds, brush, or other obstacles that might snag other types of lures. The rotating blade also creates a lot of commotion in the water, which can attract fish even when they're not actively feeding. Topwater Lures: In Very Shallow Water Topwater lures are designed to float on the surface of the water and create a lot of commotion when retrieved. They work best in very shallow water where the fish can see and hear the lure. Topwater lures are typically designed to imitate insects or other small prey that might be found on the surface of the water. Jigs: For a Very Accurate Feel on the Line Jigs are a type of soft plastic lure that is designed to imitate a variety of different types of prey, including worms, minnows, and other types of baitfish. They are typically fished by bouncing or hopping them along the bottom of the water, and they are very effective for targeting fish that are holding close to the bottom. The weight of the jig also provides a very accurate feel on the line, making it easy to detect even very subtle bites. Plastic and Rubber Lures: To Imitate Worms or Lizards Plastic and rubber lures are a soft-bodied lure that is designed to imitate worms, lizards, and other types of prey. They are typically designed to be fished along the bottom of the water, where they can imitate the movement of a natural creature. Plastic and rubber lures are an effective choice when you're trying to imitate a specific type of prey that might be found in the water you're fishing. In conclusion, choosing the right lure can make all the difference when it comes to fishing. Crankbaits are effective when you want to cover a lot of water, spinnerbaits work well when you're fishing through quick cover, topwater lures are effective in very shallow water, jigs are good for a very accurate feel on the line, and plastic and rubber lures are useful for imitating worms or lizards. By understanding which lure to use in which situation, you can increase your chances of catching more fish."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Draw a large vertical oval.
