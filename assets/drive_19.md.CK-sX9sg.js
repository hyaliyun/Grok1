It is also important to wrap a towel around your neck and shoulders to protect your clothing. Next, arrange your mirrors to ensure you have a good view of the back of your head. To begin trimming your curls, start by separating the trimmed curls from the untrimmed curls. This can be done by clipping up the sections of hair that you do not plan to trim. This will make it easier to focus on the curls you want to trim. Before cutting your hair, shake out your curls to ensure they are free of any tangles. Use a comb or brush to gently separate any stubborn knots. Once your curls are smooth and untangled, you can begin the trimming process. When trimming your curls, it is important to inspect each curl carefully. Look for split ends and damaged hair that needs to be removed. Take small sections of your hair and trim only a small amount at a time to avoid cutting too much off. After trimming each curl, shake it out again to ensure it still looks even and natural. Continue this process until all of your curls are trimmed and shaped the way you want them. In conclusion, trimming curly hair can be a delicate process that requires patience and attention to detail. By following these steps, you can ensure that your curls look healthy and well-maintained. Remember to take your time and be gentle with your hair to avoid any damage or breakage."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to who plays the leprechaun in leprechaun in the hood??","output":"Warwick Davis."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article?

In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it steps—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and deenergized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.

Applying puppy psychology to partner can train them the same way. 'Women should create scarcity; reward good and ignore bad behaviour'","output":"Sloan Sheridan-Williams, a leading life coach, suggests applying the principles of puppy psychology to train your partner. The concept revolves around creating scarcity and using positive reinforcement to reward good behavior and ignoring bad behavior. According to Sloan, women should create scarcity in their relationships. They should make their partners aware that their attention and affection are valuable, and they are not always readily available. Creating scarcity makes the partner realize the value of the relationship and can keep them interested and engaged. The principles of puppy psychology can also be applied while training a partner. Positive reinforcement is a powerful tool in shaping the behavior of dogs, and the same can be applied to humans. It is important to reward good behavior and ignore or redirect bad behavior. The idea is to acknowledge and praise your partner when they do something good, reinforcing the positive behavior. At the same time, if the partner does something undesirable, it is important to ignore the bad behavior, redirect them or withhold the reward, emphasizing that the behavior is unacceptable. This approach to training can be highly effective in building healthier, happier relationships. It is important to create a safe, secure and loving environment where both partners feel valued, appreciated and respected. The principles of puppy psychology can be used as a tool to enhance communication, increase intimacy and build stronger connections. In conclusion, applying the principles of puppy psychology in your relationship can be effective in building a stronger and healthier partnership. Creating scarcity, using positive reinforcement to reward good behavior and ignoring bad behavior can help to build a more meaningful and fulfilling relationship, where both parties feel valued and respected. Working towards better communication and mutual respect is key to building and maintaining a loving and fulfilling relationship."},{"instruction":"knows what it takes When Michigan quarterback Matt Gutierrez talks about the formula that his alma mater, De La Salle High School, has used to win a startling 151 games in a row, he talks meat and potatoes.

In the National Football League (NFL), the team that has scored the most points via field goals is the New England Patriots. As of the end of the 2020-2021 NFL season, the Patriots had a total of 1,381 points scored through field goals. In other leagues, such as the Canadian Football League (CFL) or the Arena Football League (AFL), the team with the most points scored through field goals may be different. However, the same principle applies in that the team with the most accurate and consistent field goal kicker, as well as a strong offensive strategy that can position the team for field goal attempts, is likely to have the highest number of points scored through field goals. Overall, the number of points scored through field goals may not always be the most important metric for determining a team's success. Other factors, such as touchdowns scored or defensive performance, may have a greater impact on the outcome of a game. Nonetheless, having a reliable and skilled field goal kicker can make a significant difference in a team's ability to score points and ultimately win games."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: An appropriation act is the most common means of providing budget authority, but in some cases the authorizing legislation itself provides the budget authority.

This information comes from a recent analysis of the current NFL season, which found that the Ravens have scored ten field goals in the third quarter of their games. This is a significant achievement, as field goals are an important part of any team's scoring strategy. While touchdowns are typically seen as the most exciting way to score points in football, field goals can also make a huge difference in the outcome of a game. In fact, many close matches have been won or lost due to successful or missed field goals. Of course, it's worth noting that this information is based on a specific point in the season, and that the number of field goals kicked by teams can fluctuate over time. Additionally, other factors like weather conditions or injuries to key players can make a big difference in a team's ability to score field goals. Despite these caveats, however, it's clear that the Baltimore Ravens have been successful in scoring field goals in the third quarter. Whether this will continue throughout the rest of the season remains to be seen, but for now, the Ravens can feel confident in their ability to get points on the board when it matters most."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence.

With any technology, he says, criminals are going to use it for something.

Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian protoscientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu, a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena. According to the historian A.

However, we can make some general observations and provide some possible sources to help shed light on this topic. Firstly, it's worth noting that one-yard touchdown passes are among the most common types of touchdown passes in football. As the name suggests, these passes involve throwing the ball from one yard away from the end zone, and the receiver catching the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. One-yard touchdown passes can be executed in various ways, such as slant routes, fade routes, and quick screens, and are often used in short-yardage situations or near the goal line. When it comes to the number of 1-yard touchdown passes thrown in a given season or by a particular player, there are several sources that can provide insights. Some of the most reliable sources include NFL and NCAA statistics websites, which offer comprehensive data on various aspects of football, including touchdowns, passes, receptions, and yardage. Websites such as Pro Football Reference, ESPN Stats & Info, and NCAA.com are trusted resources for football fans and analysts alike, and can be a great place to start when looking for specific information on touchdown passes. Another way to get insights into the number of 1-yard touchdown passes thrown is to follow the coverage of football games and news outlets. Sports writers and analysts often provide commentary and analysis on the performance of quarterbacks, receivers, and other players, and may mention the number of short-yardage touchdown passes thrown during a game, season, or career. By following major sports media outlets, such as ESPN, Fox Sports, or CBS Sports, you can stay up-to-date with the latest developments in football and find out more about the number of 1-yard touchdown passes thrown. In conclusion, while there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how many 1-yard touchdown passes were thrown, there are many ways to obtain valuable insights and information on this topic.

Press the iron against the paper for 10 to 15 seconds. Let the paper cool, then press it for another 10 to 15 seconds. Let the flowers cool before using them.","output":"Article: Drying flowers can be a great way to preserve their beauty long after they have wilted. Whether you want to keep a bouquet from a special occasion or display some flowers for decoration, drying them can be a simple and fun process. To dry flowers using an iron, you'll first need to cut the flowers down to a suitable length, removing any leaves or excess stems. Then, use a clean cloth or tissue to pat them dry, removing any moisture. Next, you'll want to flatten the flowers between the pages of a heavy book, giving the flowers enough room to spread out without overlapping. This will help to press the flowers evenly and avoid any creases. Once the flowers are securely pressed in the book, place them between two sheets of parchment paper and one sheet of paper towel to protect the iron and to avoid any direct contact between the iron and the flowers. Set your iron to its lowest heat setting, and make sure there is no water in the iron. Gently press the iron against the paper, holding it in place for about 10 to 15 seconds. Be careful not to press too hard or too long, as this can damage the delicate petals. After the first round of pressing, let the paper and flowers cool for a moment before repeating the process, holding the iron for another 10 to 15 seconds. Once you're satisfied with the results, let the flowers cool completely before handling them. Dried flowers can be used for a variety of crafts and projects, from creating decorative wreaths to filling jars for home decor. By using these simple steps, you can enjoy the beauty of your favorite flowers long after they have gone out of season."},{"instruction":"Ancient Greece: What happened after the Trojan war?

Unhappily, with all the pilots being nonbelievers, the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over.

Close friends of Darren Wilson now want star witness to be charged over 'lying' about officer's actions. Johnson broke silence last night and said he had feared Wilson would kill him too. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Dorian Johnson's initial statement to authorities about the events surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in the summer of 2014 seemed cut and dry. Johnson claimed that Brown had put his hands in the air and told Wilson that he didn't have a gun before being fatally shot. However, Wilson's version of events differed entirely from Johnson's, and it was ultimately Wilson's testimony that was believed by a grand jury. Johnson's claims sparked massive protests in Ferguson, Missouri and became a national news story. But now, close friends of Wilson are calling for Johnson to be charged with lying about the officer's actions. The controversy surrounding Johnson's claims has once again brought attention to the fraught relationship between law enforcement and minority communities. Johnson, who has remained largely out of the public eye since the shooting, recently broke his silence in an interview with news outlet ABC News. In the interview, Johnson claimed that he feared for his own life during the altercation with Wilson and that he was \\"terrified\\" by the officer's actions. The shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent protests in Ferguson and elsewhere led to a national conversation about police brutality and racial injustice. Johnson's claims were seen by many as emblematic of the dangers that black Americans face when interacting with law enforcement. But the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson in the case raised questions about the use of excessive force by police officers and the difficulty of holding law enforcement accountable for their actions. The debate over Johnson's testimony highlights the deep divides between those who advocate for police accountability and those who defend law enforcement officers. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking out all of the facts before coming to a conclusion about a high-profile event. While the events in Ferguson are now several years in the past, they continue to reverberate in the national conversation around race and law enforcement."},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: He needed to get to the mountain fast, and the fastest way around the woods took at least five days longer than through it.","output":"Heneededtogettothemountainfast,andthefastestwayaroundthewoodstookatleastfivedayslongerthanthroughit."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Giraffe, eatType = coffee shop, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = average, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers.

One of the most important aspects of pet care is ensuring that their living space is clean, safe, and enriched. If you have a small pet such as a hamster, guinea pig, or bird, providing them with a cage that includes plenty of toys and keeping it clean at all times can go a long way in keeping them happy and healthy. The first step in creating a comfortable living space for your pet is purchasing a cage that is appropriate for their size and needs. This might mean selecting a cage that provides plenty of space for movement and play, or one that includes multiple levels or compartments for nesting and exploring. Whatever the case may be, make sure the cage is constructed with materials that are durable and easy to clean. Once you have your cage, the next step is to provide enrichment through toys and accessories. Pets that have plenty of toys to play with and things to explore are less likely to become bored or agitated, which can lead to health and behavior problems. Toys such as chew blocks, swings, tunnels, and ladders can provide hours of entertainment and give your pet the mental and physical stimulation they need to stay happy and healthy. Finally, it is essential to keep your pet's cage clean at all times. This means regularly changing the bedding, washing food and water bowls, and removing any debris or waste from the cage. A clean environment can help prevent illness and infection, as well as provide a comfortable space for your pet to rest and play. In conclusion, providing your pet with a clean and enriched cage is essential for their overall health and happiness. By investing in a high-quality cage, providing plenty of toys for enrichment, and keeping the living space clean and sanitary, you can ensure that your furry friend will lead a healthy and fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to pakistan cricket team captain in 1983 world cup??","output":"The captain of Pakistan cricket team in the 1983 World Cup was Imran Khan."},{"instruction":"Yngwie Johan Malmsteen ( ; born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerbäck; 30 June 1963) is a Swedish guitarist and bandleader.

The new family of jets aims to be lighter and quieter than its rivals, and already has more than 150 orders, but that's only half the goal. The CS100 is the first new jet family produced by Bombardier in decades, and the company hopes to use this to carve out a space in the competitive aviation industry. The jet, which seats up to 133 passengers, was designed for both short-haul and longer-range flights, making it a versatile option for airlines. The plane is also significantly quieter than similar jets, resulting in less noise pollution around airports. It is also lighter, making it more fuel-efficient and less expensive to operate. With these features, the CS100 sets Bombardier apart from the competition, and could give it an edge in the marketplace. Despite the success of the test flight, there have been some financial setbacks for Bombardier. The CS100 has overshot its initial budget estimate of 3.4 billion by 500 million. However, with more than 150 orders already placed and increasing demand for quieter, more efficient aircraft, the plane is poised for success in the coming years. Overall, the completion of the CS100 test flight presents a significant milestone for Bombardier and the aviation industry as a whole. As airlines look for more eco-friendly, cost-efficient planes, the success of the CS100 could impact future aircraft designs, leading to a new generation of quieter, more efficient aircraft."},{"instruction":"What is a onesentence summary of the following article?

When we are excluded from groups or activities, it can result in feelings of loneliness, isolation, and low-self esteem. If you are experiencing rejection, it is important to identify the possible causes of it. This can help you to address any underlying issues and find ways to overcome the feelings of rejection. One possible cause of exclusion is a lack of shared interests or values. If you are not participating in activities or groups that align with your interests or values, it can be difficult to feel included. Additionally, if you are not expressing yourself authentically, this can also make it hard for others to connect with you. Another possible cause of exclusion is interpersonal conflicts. If you have had a falling out with someone or have difficulty communicating with others, it can cause them to exclude you from activities or groups. It is important to work on resolving conflicts and improving communication skills to prevent this from happening. The negative effects of feeling left out can be significant. It can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-worth. It can also affect your physical health by increasing stress levels and weakening your immune system. Over time, feeling excluded can become a chronic problem that can affect all areas of your life. If you are experiencing rejection, it is important to take steps to address it. This may involve finding new activities or groups that align with your interests and values. It may also mean working on interpersonal conflicts or improving communication skills.

Pruning helps control the growth and shape of the tree and also promotes proper fruit development. For the first year, it is recommended to prune all but 5 branches. This will allow the tree to focus its energy on developing a strong framework. Additionally, it is important to cut the 5 main branches in half to encourage lateral growth. To maintain the tree's shape and encourage fruiting, it is also necessary to prune the new growth during the winter season. You should cut back half of the new growth to prevent the tree from becoming too bushy and to encourage fruit growth. Finally, don't forget to prune the suckers that grow at the base of the tree. These suckers are non-productive and can take away vital nutrients from the main plant. It is important to remove them regularly to prevent them from getting too big and causing more harm to the main plant.

According to contemporary sources, King Christian commanded an army of around 20,000 soldiers during the Battle of Lutter in 1626. This figure includes both Danish and German soldiers, so we can assume that the 2,000 German soldiers were already part of this number. In other words, King Christian had approximately 18,000 Danish soldiers and 2,000 German soldiers under his command during this battle. It's worth noting that King Christian's army fluctuated in size over the course of the war. At some points, he had more or fewer soldiers depending on the circumstances. However, it seems that 20,000 soldiers was a rough estimate of the size of his army during the Battle of Lutter. In conclusion, King Christian IV had approximately 20,000 soldiers under his command during the Battle of Lutter, which included 18,000 Danish soldiers and 2,000 German soldiers. This alliance with the Germans was just one example of how King Christian leveraged external support to achieve his military objectives during the Thirty Years' War."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: What would you be buying if you went into Hamleys in Londo","output":"Toys."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Jane Andrews went to middle school.

Cut the lowest layer of layered hair.","output":"When it comes to cutting layered hair, it is important to consider the angle at which you hold the scissors, the depth of the cut, and which layer of hair to start with. To achieve a seamless and professional-looking haircut, follow these simple tips. Firstly, hold the scissors at a lower angle when cutting. This will create a softer and more blended look, rather than a harsh and choppy one. It also ensures that the layers are not cut too short, as it can be difficult to fix a mistake once the hair has been cut. Next, cut the hair deeper than one inch (2.5 cm), especially if you are working with thicker hair. This allows for even layering and helps achieve a more natural flow when styling the hair afterward. Finally, start by cutting the lowest layer of the hair. This ensures that the layers are properly blended and creates a natural-looking effect. It also helps to create a solid foundation for the rest of the layers to be cut on top of. By following these tips, you can achieve a beautiful and well-blended layered haircut.

For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposablecamera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or highvoltage capacitors, for instance using a Brinkley stick. Capacitors may also have builtin discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed.

In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis.

This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of Angus Calder's book The Myth of the Blitz (1991). It was evoked by both the right and left political factions in Britain during the Falklands War when it was embedded in a nostalgic narrative in which the Second World War represented aggressive British patriotism successfully defending democracy. This imagery of people in the Blitz was and is powerfully portrayed in film, radio, newspapers and magazines. At the time it was a useful propaganda tool for home and foreign consumption. Historians' critical response to this construction focused on what were seen as overemphasised claims of righteous nationalism and national unity. In the Myth of the Blitz, Calder exposed some of the counterevidence of antisocial and divisive behaviours. What he saw as the myth—serene national unity—became historical truth.

But it was their actions during the medal ceremony that truly made history. As the American national anthem played, Smith and Carlos bowed their heads and raised their fists in the air, clad in black gloves as a symbol of Black Power. Their gesture was intended to draw attention to the ongoing struggle for civil rights in the United States, and to protest the treatment of Black Americans by the government and society at large.

Before you fill your tray with water, it's important to make sure it's clean and odor-free. If you're using an old tray that has been sitting in your freezer for a while, it may develop a stale or musty odor. To deodorize the tray, simply rinse it with warm water and a mild dish soap. For tougher odors, you can soak the tray in a solution of water and white vinegar, then rinse it thoroughly. Once your tray is clean and odor-free, you're ready to fill it with water. It's important to use fresh, clean water, as impurities can affect the taste and quality of your ice cubes. Be sure to fill the tray to the recommended level, as overfilling can cause the cubes to stick together or spill over. When choosing a tray, consider the size and shape of the cubes you want. Some trays have larger or smaller cubes, which can affect how quickly they melt in your drink. Additionally, some trays produce ice cubes in fun shapes, like stars or hearts, which can add a playful touch to your drinks.

One option to consider is a green tea compress. Research has shown that green tea has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce swelling and pain. To make a green tea compress, steep a green tea bag in hot water for several minutes, then let it cool down. Place the tea bag directly onto the affected area and leave it there for a few minutes. Repeat as needed. Another natural remedy for aching muscles and joints is an ice compress. Applying an ice pack to the area can help reduce inflammation and numb the pain. Simply wrap ice cubes in a towel or use a pre-made ice pack from the freezer, and apply it to the affected area for up to 20 minutes at a time. It's important not to leave the ice on for too long, as it can cause frostbite. Lastly, aromatherapy is also an option to consider. Certain essential oils, such as lavender and peppermint, have been shown to have pain-relieving properties. You can add a few drops of these oils to a warm bath, use them in a diffuser, or apply them directly to the skin with a carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil. While these natural remedies may not work for everyone, they are typically safe and worth trying before resorting to medication.

To ensure that your date goes smoothly and both of you enjoy each other's company, it's essential to stick to positive conversational topics. Focusing on positive topics such as hobbies, interests or future plans can help to build a strong connection with your partner. Another key aspect of a successful date is sharing personal details about your life. By sharing details about yourself, you create a sense of closeness and allow your partner to get to know you better. However, it's important to keep the conversation balanced by asking your date questions about himself. This helps to show your interest in their personality and makes them feel valued. To make your partner feel heard and understood, it's important to practice active listening techniques. This might involve nodding, maintaining eye contact or repeating what they've said to show that you're engaged in the conversation. Physical touch can be a powerful tool for conveying interest, but it's important to approach this with caution. Gently touching your partner's arm or shoulder during conversation can be a subtle way to show that you're attracted to them. However, it's crucial to ensure that the physical touch is appropriate and consensual. After your date's main event, going for a walk together can be an excellent way to continue the conversation and deepen your connection. Walking side-by-side creates an intimate and relaxed setting, making it easier to have a meaningful conversation. Lastly, maintaining good manners throughout the date should be a priority. Showing courtesy, respect and good behavior towards your date can make a world of difference in creating a positive experience. Remembering to say please and thank you, opening doors and avoiding interrupting are all ways to show that you are kind, attentive and respectful towards your partner.

Respect yourself. Be yourself. Pursue your passions. Communicate clearly and often. Stop playing games.

Firstly, respect is non-negotiable. Not only should you show respect to your significant other, but to everyone else you encounter as well. This includes treating yourself with respect and setting boundaries that reflect your worth. It is also important to be true to yourself and your partner. Being genuine and authentic will allow you both to feel comfortable and secure in the relationship. Pursuing your passions and interests, while still making time for each other, will foster individual growth and strengthen the bond between you. Effective communication is another crucial element in building a healthy relationship. Clear and frequent communication can help prevent misunderstandings and allows partners to work together to overcome challenges. Playing games is a common pitfall in relationships that can ultimately lead to their downfall. Games like jealousy, withholding affection or communication, and passive-aggressive behavior only serve to erode trust and create unnecessary competition. Lastly, taking initiative and being proactive can help to keep the relationship fresh and exciting. Planning dates or surprise outings, trying new activities, or simply showing extra affection are all ways to keep the spark alive. By respecting yourself and others, being true to yourself, communicating effectively, avoiding games, and taking initiative, you can build and maintain a strong and healthy relationship that stands the test of time."},{"instruction":"Are the following two questions the same?

One of the most common issues that arise with plumbing fixtures is leaks around areas such as sinks, showers, and faucets. Fortunately, fixing these leaks is relatively simple and can be done by following a few easy steps. The first step in fixing a leak is to clean away any excess putty around the affected area. This putty can accumulate over time and can cause leaks if not removed. Use a putty knife to remove the excess putty, being careful not to damage any of the surrounding plumbing fixtures. Once the excess putty has been removed, wash the area with soap and water to remove any dirt or debris. This will ensure that the new putty will stick properly. If you notice that there are still leaks after cleaning the area, it may be necessary to disassemble the affected parts and apply new putty. This is especially important if the leaks are around areas such as the sink or shower drain, as water can seep into the surrounding walls and cause further damage. When applying new putty, make sure to use a high-quality, waterproof putty that is designed for plumbing fixtures. Apply the putty evenly around the affected area, making sure to cover any gaps or cracks. In conclusion, fixing leaks in plumbing fixtures can be relatively simple if you follow the right steps.

During a game between the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw a pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings for an astonishing 99 yards touchdown. This not only broke the record for the longest touchdown pass in Packers history, but it also tied the record for the longest touchdown pass in NFL history. The record was first set on November 10th, 1985, by Dallas Cowboys quarterback Steve Pelluer, who threw a 99 yards touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Renfro. Since then, several quarterbacks have come close to breaking this record. In 2011, Matt Stafford of the Detroit Lions threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Johnson, and in the same year, Tom Brady of the New England Patriots threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Deion Branch. However, their passes fell short of the all-time record. It's worth noting that while this is the longest touchdown pass in NFL history, it's not the longest completed pass. The longest completed pass occurred in 2016 when Philip Rivers of the San Diego Chargers threw a 109-yard pass to Travis Benjamin. However, this pass only went for a 66-yard gain, as Benjamin caught it in the end zone and ran the remaining distance for the touchdown. In conclusion, the longest touchdown pass in NFL history is 99 yards, a record first set in 1985 and tied in 2008. While several quarterbacks have come close to breaking this record, no one has been able to surpass it yet."},{"instruction":"Bulging veins, thinning skin and liver spots among women's concerns. One in eight are more concerned about condition of hands than face. Madonna, 54, frequently photographed wearing gloves to hide her hands. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The signs of aging are inevitable, and for many women, the concerns go beyond just wrinkles and fine lines on their faces. Bulging veins, thinning skin, and liver spots on their hands are some of the top concerns among women. According to a study, one in eight women is more concerned about the condition of their hands than their face. The reason for this concern is simple – our hands can often give away our age more than our faces. The skin on our hands is thinner and has less collagen, making it more prone to damage and signs of aging. Over time, the veins on our hands can also become more prominent, giving them a bony, aged appearance. Liver spots, or age spots, which are caused by sun exposure, can also develop on the hands. Even ageless celebrities like Madonna have been known to struggle with hand concerns. The 54-year-old iconic singer has been frequently photographed wearing gloves to hide her hands, which she has deemed as the \\"giveaway of one's age.\\" Fortunately, there are ways to address these concerns. Sunscreen is crucial in preventing further damage to the skin on our hands. Moisturizing regularly can also help maintain the skin's hydration and elasticity. For those who are already dealing with bulging veins, sclerotherapy can help reduce their appearance. Laser treatments can also be an effective way to target sunspots and improve skin texture on the hands. In conclusion, taking care of our hands is just as important as taking care of our faces in our anti-aging routines. By protecting and treating our hands, we can feel more confident in our overall appearance and continue to defy the signs of aging."},{"instruction":"Premise: It was already there ”in the mixture.

The discovery provides a rare insight into the practice of embalming that was highly regarded in ancient Egypt, where it was believed to be critical in ensuring a successful afterlife. Experts involved in the study have described the finding as a significant milestone that re-writes our understanding of the ancient Egyptian civilisation. They believe that this new discovery will help historians and researchers to answer unanswered questions about the culture and traditions of the ancient Egyptians. The study has challenged previous beliefs that embalming as a practice emerged much later in Egyptian history. The discovery of this early use of embalming agents provides additional evidence that the ancient Egyptians were an advanced civilisation that had a deep understanding of the human body and its preservation. In conclusion, the discovery of ancient embalming agents in an Egyptian cemetery has led to a renewed understanding of the practices and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. This groundbreaking finding will undoubtedly spark additional research into ancient Egyptian traditions and possibly challenge current beliefs and historical records. Ultimately, this new knowledge is a testament to the significance of preserving and studying our past."},{"instruction":"he also founded the ntp pool (crowdsourced time synchronisation), which our project has since fully adopted.
