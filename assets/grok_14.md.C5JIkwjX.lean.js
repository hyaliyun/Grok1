With the right pruning techniques, you can preserve the tree's shape and ensure that it remains healthy for years to come. The first step in pruning a mature tree is to cut off any low or damaged branches. These branches can be removed to maintain the central leader shape of the tree. The central leader is the main trunk of the tree, which gives it its shape and stability. By cutting off low or damaged branches, you can prevent them from interfering with the central leader and the tree's overall structure. Another important aspect of pruning mature trees is to remove any forked or crossing branches. These branches can rub against each other and cause damage, which can lead to disease and pest problems. By removing them, you can keep your tree healthy and ensure that it continues to thrive for years to come. When pruning mature trees, it's important to use the right tools and techniques. You should always use sharp pruning shears or saws and make clean cuts to minimize damage. Additionally, you should always prune during the dormant season when the tree is not actively growing to minimize stress and allow the tree to heal more quickly. Pruning mature trees is an essential task that can help preserve their shape and keep them healthy for years to come. By cutting off low or damaged branches and removing forked or crossing branches, you can ensure that your trees continue to thrive and provide beauty and shade to your landscape.

Do not contact Clinton via phone or email.","output":"As a general rule, waiting for a response to any communication can be frustrating and at times even infuriating. However, in the case of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, waiting for a response to a mail can take multiple months. It is important to note that in such an event, it is best not to contact Clinton via phone or e-mail. There can be several reasons for the delay in response from Clinton’s team. One possibility may be the sheer volume of correspondence she and her staff receive daily. As a public figure who garners a great deal of attention, it is expected that her inbox would be flooded with requests, queries, and messages that need to be sorted through and prioritized. Additionally, she may have a small team overseeing all of her communication, making it difficult to promptly respond to every message that comes through. Another possibility for the delay could be the sensitive nature of the content in the message. In this case, it may be best practice for her team to take their time to carefully consider every aspect of the message and respond thoroughly in a more timely manner. This practice is especially true if responding to the message requires the help of other experts who might not be readily available.

It is recommended to change the razor blade every 5-7 shaves to maintain its sharpness. Secondly, apply a layer of shaving cream or soap to lubricate the area and provide protection from the razor's edge. This will also help to prevent razor burn and bumps that can be caused by dry shaving. Thirdly, shave at any angle that feels comfortable for you. There is no specific direction that must be followed, but it is recommended to start with the grain and then go against it for a closer shave. Fourthly, apply a moisturizer afterward to soothe the skin and prevent dryness. This will also help to reduce the likelihood of ingrown hairs. Lastly, consider shaving your underarms in the shower. The warm water and steam can help to soften the hair and make it easier to shave. It also provides a convenient location to rinse away any hair or shaving cream residue.

One of the most important is the infrastructure of the area where you will be working. This includes things like roads, buildings, and utilities. If you are building something new, you will need to think about how you will access the site and what kind of environmental restrictions there might be. The first thing to consider is the basic infrastructure of the area. This includes roads, bridges, and other transportation facilities that will be needed to get materials and workers to the site. You will also need to think about utilities like water, electricity, and gas. If you are building in a remote or rural area, you may need to plan for these services to be installed before you can begin. Accessibility is another important factor to consider. You need to make sure that your site is easily accessible for workers, especially if they will be commuting from another town or city. If there are no nearby transportation facilities or if the roads are in poor condition, you may need to plan for additional transportation services. Before you start any construction work, you need to analyze the existing infrastructure in the area. This includes any nearby buildings or structures, as well as any environmental factors that may affect your project. For example, you may need to consider flood plains, wetlands, or other environmental restrictions that could impact your construction plans. Investigating environmental restrictions is particularly important if you will be building in a natural area. There may be restrictions on what kind of materials you can use, what kind of equipment you can bring in, or even what kind of work you can do during certain seasons. Finally, you need to find out what permits you will need for your project. This can vary depending on the area where you will be building, and can include things like zoning permits, building permits, and environmental permits. It's important to get all of the permits you need before you start any work, as failing to do so can result in costly delays and fines. Depending on the size and scope of your project, you may also need to hire a caretaker to oversee the site. This person will be responsible for ensuring that the site is safe and secure, and will be on hand to deal with any issues that may arise. Overall, there are many factors to consider when planning a new project. By taking the time to carefully analyze the existing infrastructure, investigate environmental restrictions, and find out what permits you will need, you can help ensure that your project is a success."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: Clarence Darrow (18571938), fictionalized by Tracey, Spacey, and Fonda among others, was a famous American libertarian and?

The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety.

Spain had been greatly weakened by the Napoleonic Wars, with much of its territory lost to France and its economy in shambles. When representatives from Spain arrived at the Congress, they were not able to advance their interests in the same way that larger, more powerful nations could. Furthermore, Spain was still dealing with unrest at home, including revolts in its American colonies. This made it difficult for Spain to present a united front and make its voice heard at the Congress. As a result, Spain was largely ignored in the decisions made at the Congress of Vienna. While it did receive some territorial concessions, it was not able to secure any significant gains and was overshadowed by the likes of Britain, France, and Austria. Overall, the Congress of Vienna was a reflection of the power dynamics of the time, and Spain's lack of influence was a clear indication of its weakened position in the world."},{"instruction":"ere are some concepts: dramatist, know, portrait What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"The dramatist used his knowledge of human nature to create a powerful portrait of his characters."},{"instruction":"Westbury Senior High School is a ninththrough12thgrade school of the Westbury Union Free School District (USFD No. 1), the district covering the village of Westbury, New York, USA.

A 1950s college thespian (and allaround jerk) woos a coed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling, eventually becoming a Gorgeous Georgelike celebrity. Turning likable Winkler into an obnoxious goofoff probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his television alterego), but the jokes and situations are often wrongheaded and mean, staged rather sloppily by director Carl Reiner. Particularly crude is a wincing bit involving Hervé Villechaize (of Fantasy Island) putting the moves on Polly Holliday (Flo from Alice).

The drop kick was supplanted by the place kick, which cannot be attempted out of a formation generally used as a running or passing set.

Leading the group of officials responsible for these errors is Mike Riley, the head of the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO). If any team manager presided over such a series of mistakes, they would likely be sacked - and many are questioning whether Riley should face similar consequences. The list of incidents is a long one, with several high-profile teams and players affected. Liverpool were given a penalty for handball even though the ball had hit the face of Leicester City's Wes Morgan, while QPR goalkeeper Rob Green was caught handling the ball outside his area. Hull were twice denied what appeared to be clear penalties for handball incidents, and Manchester United benefited from a number of questionable decisions, including Chris Smalling's handball going unpunished. Other teams were not so lucky. Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas was cautioned for simulation despite clearly being fouled by Southampton's Matt Targett, while Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse stayed on the pitch despite elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman. Burnley were also the subject of a major mistake when George Boyd scored against Manchester City while clearly offside. Stoke striker Jon Walters, meanwhile, escaped a red card in a match against Everton. Given the volume and severity of these errors, many are calling for stricter oversight and accountability for English referees. Whether that means introducing technology like VAR, increasing the number of officials on the pitch, or simply improving training and development initiatives, it's clear that something needs to be done to prevent these kinds of incidents from happening again in the future. No team or player should be subject to such unfair and costly decisions, and it's time for English football to step up and ensure that the sport is played on a level playing field - both on and off the pitch."},{"instruction":"Does the word line have the same definition in the next two sentences?

When motion can no longer be detected, the lights shut off. Passive infrared sensors react to changes in heat, such as the pattern created by a moving person.

The best applications for passive infrared occupancy sensors are open spaces with a clear view of the area being scanned. Ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return. A break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control. Ultrasonic sensors can see around obstructions and are best for areas with cabinets and shelving, restrooms, and open areas requiring 360degree coverage.

A toilet that runs continuously can waste up to 200 gallons of water per day, costing you money and resources. Check the flapper valve, the float arm, or the fill valve for malfunctions or damages. 5. Check your water meter. Turn off all faucets, showers, and appliances that use water, and note the reading on your water meter. Wait for 30 minutes to an hour, and check again. If the reading has changed, you may have a hidden leak that needs to be found. By following these tips, you can become more vigilant and proactive in detecting plumbing leaks at home. Remember, small leaks can become big problems, so don't wait until it's too late to fix them."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: sweden 's economics museum has ended up on the wrong side of the law of supply and demand .","output":"Sweden's economics museum violated the law of supply and demand."},{"instruction":"the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

Comes as many states are having problems getting the rare chemicals needed to perform lethal injections. Utah has an operating firing squad room used to kill death row inmates.","output":"In recent years, many states have been struggling to find a feasible and humane approach to their death penalty. Republican state senator Bruce Burns believes that gas chambers are less humane than firing squads and would be too expensive to build. It’s an interesting take on the issue, though one worth considering. Burns’ view is supported by the fact that many states are having a hard time getting the rare chemicals needed to perform lethal injections. This has left some states searching for alternatives in their methods of capital punishment. Burns suggests that using gas chambers is a less humane method than firing squads. This is because the use of gas chambers can cause prolonged suffering for the prisoner, which can be both cruel and inhumane. Furthermore, building a gas chamber would be a costly affair. With the cost of construction and the ongoing upkeep of such a facility, the overall expense would be significant. Burns argues that a firing squad room, such as the one already operating in Utah, is a much more cost-effective solution. Utah has been using firing squads to execute death row inmates since the 19th century. The facility is an operating, fully equipped room that has been used for years. Given the ongoing challenges that many states face in finding a solution to their death penalty issues, the Utah firing squad may be an option worth exploring. In conclusion, the issue of capital punishment is a contentious one that offers no easy answers. Bruce Burns’ views on the use of gas chambers versus firing squads highlights the ongoing struggle to find a workable and humane solution. However, as many states continue to struggle with their methods of execution, it may be time to consider alternative approaches, such as the Utah firing squad."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to be real Understand what authenticity means.

The Codex Justinianus (1:5:12) defines everyone who is not devoted to the Catholic Church and to our Orthodox holy Faith a heretic. The Church had always dealt harshly with strands of Christianity that it considered heretical, but before the 11th century these tended to centre around individual preachers or small localised sects, like Arianism, Pelagianism, Donatism, Marcionism and Montanism. The diffusion of the almost Manichaean sect of Paulicians westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of Bogomils in modern day Bosnia, a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianity. By the 11th century, more organised groups such as the Patarini, the Dulcinians, the Waldensians and the Cathars were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of northern Italy, southern France and Flanders.

Devein the shrimp. Cook the shrimp.","output":"Shrimp is a delicious and versatile shellfish that can be cooked in a variety of ways. However, preparing shrimp can be a daunting task for some, especially for those who have never done it before. Here are some easy steps to follow to prepare and cook shrimp. First, you need to cut the shrimp down its back with a sharp knife. This will expose the vein, which needs to be removed. Deveining shrimp is important not only for aesthetic reasons but also for health reasons. The vein contains waste matter, and removing it reduces the risk of illness caused by ingesting harmful bacteria. To devein the shrimp, use the tip of your knife to lift the vein and then gently pull it out with your fingers. Some shrimp may have a black, gritty substance right above the vein, which is the digestive tract. You can remove it by gently scraping it off with the tip of the knife. After you have cleaned the shrimp, it is ready to be cooked. There are many ways to cook shrimp, including boiling, grilling, sautéing, and frying. Here is a simple way to sauté shrimp: - Heat some oil or butter in a pan over medium-high heat. - Add the cleaned shrimp to the pan and season with salt and pepper, or your favorite seasoning. - Cook the shrimp for about 2-3 minutes on each side until it turns pink and opaque. - Remove the shrimp from the pan and serve immediately. Shrimp is a great source of protein, vitamin B12, and selenium, and it is also low in calories. It can be enjoyed in many dishes, such as pasta, rice, salads, and tacos. With these simple steps, you can easily prepare and cook shrimp to enjoy its delicious flavor and health benefits."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? where did the tradition of the christmas tree originate?","output":"The tradition of the Christmas tree is believed to have originated in Germany."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this Know your state's alcohol laws. Figure out if you need an onlicense or an offlicense. Figure out the specific class of license you need.","output":"When it comes to selling alcohol, it's essential to be knowledgeable about your state's alcohol laws. Each state has its unique rules and regulations that determine who can sell alcohol, what type of alcohol can be sold, and under what conditions. One of the first things you should determine is whether you need an on-license or an off-license. An on-license is required if you're planning to sell alcohol for consumption on your premises, such as a bar or restaurant. An off-license, on the other hand, is required if you're planning to sell alcohol for consumption off your property, such as a liquor store. Once you've determined which type of license you need, the next step is to figure out the specific class of license required for your establishment. In most states, there are different classes of licenses depending on the type of establishment and the volume of alcohol you plan to sell. For example, some states have different licenses for restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Some states also have different licenses based on the type of alcohol being sold. For example, you may need a separate license to sell beer, wine, and spirits. It's important to note that obtaining a license for selling alcohol can be a complicated and time-consuming process. In most states, you'll need to fill out an application and provide detailed information about your establishment, including its location, the type of alcohol you plan to sell, and the volume of alcohol you anticipate selling. You'll also need to pass a background check and pay a fee for your license. The fees for alcohol licenses can be high, so it's crucial to factor in this expense when planning your business. Knowing your state's alcohol laws and understanding the license requirements can help you avoid costly fines and legal problems. By obtaining the correct license for your establishment, you can create a safe and responsible environment for your customers to enjoy alcohol responsibly."},{"instruction":"'m basing this on my observations of one episode I saw last night (9/27/06).

Some people find moles to be a unique feature while others may want to remove them for cosmetic reasons. There are several ways to remove moles, including surgery and laser treatment, but these options can be expensive and may cause scarring. If you're looking for a more natural approach, there are several home remedies you can try. One such remedy is to experiment with pomegranate juice as a natural whitener. Pomegranate juice contains natural acids and antioxidants that can help lighten the skin and reduce the appearance of moles. To try this remedy, soak a cotton ball in pomegranate juice and apply it to the mole. Leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water. Another natural remedy to try is honey. Honey is a natural moisturizer and can help soften the mole, making it more flexible. This can make it easier to remove or reduce the appearance of the mole. To use honey, apply a small amount of honey to the mole and cover it with a band-aid. Leave it on overnight, and repeat this process every night until the mole softens. Castor oil is another natural remedy that can be used to reduce the appearance of moles. Castor oil contains natural acids and can help exfoliate the skin, removing dead skin cells and reducing the appearance of moles. To use castor oil, apply a small amount to the mole and massage it in for a few minutes. Repeat this process twice a day for a few weeks to see results. Finally, holding an ice cube on the mole can help reduce the blood supply to the area, making it less prominent. To do this, wrap an ice cube in a towel and press it against the mole for 10-15 minutes every day. In conclusion, there are several natural remedies you can try to remove or reduce the appearance of moles. Experimenting with pomegranate juice, honey, castor oil, and ice cubes can all be effective ways to naturally treat moles at home.

Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley.

Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated and coining the term Darwinism as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.

The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of Alexander Pushkin (Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (socalled высо́кий стиль — high style) in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов), Nikolai Gogol (Никола́й Го́голь), Aleksander Griboyedov (Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

Unfortunately, many of them are camping illegally and selling \\"friendship bracelets\\" on the streets to make money. Officials are concerned that the influx of these stranded individuals will put a significant strain on an already over-stretched welfare system. The situation has become so dire that the Russian government has been forced to get involved, warning that anyone remaining illegally will be deported back to Argentina. However, many of these migrants are simply refusing to return home due to the poor economy and lack of job opportunities there. This is not the first time that an event like this has occurred. During the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a similar situation unfolded with many Argentinians staying put long after their team was eliminated. However, unlike Russia, Brazil had to deal with a much larger influx of stranded Argentinians, which put a considerable strain on their resources. For now, the Argentine government has asked the migrants to return home, but it remains to be seen how effective their plea will be. With no easy solution in sight, it looks like these stranded Argentinians will have to decide whether they want to continue selling friendship bracelets on the streets of Russia or risk deportation back to Argentina."},{"instruction":"the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .

It's also important to consider a backup material in case your primary choice is not readily available or you run out mid-project.

This will give you a level base to work with and prevent any flooding or unexpected collapses. Lay the floors and build the walls, making sure to leave spaces for windows or doors as needed. Place torches inside the house for lighting and ambiance. Add a roof to your house to protect yourself from the elements and give your structure a completed look. Lastly, create a front door and place your bed inside the house for a cozy place to rest.

While it's easy to get caught up in lengthy conversations and constant messaging, this can actually have a negative impact on both our productivity and mental health. One key strategy for keeping interactions short is to avoid them whenever possible. While it can be tempting to engage in chatter and small talk, this can quickly spiral out of control and waste valuable time. Instead, try to focus on the task at hand and limit your interactions to only those that are absolutely necessary. Additionally, ignoring a person can be a powerful tool for managing your online interactions. While it may seem rude or dismissive, sometimes it's necessary to set boundaries and protect your own mental health. If someone is sending you too many messages or taking up too much of your time, don't be afraid to simply stop responding. Finally, it's important to withhold virtual responses when necessary. While it can be tempting to respond immediately to every message or email, this can create an unhealthy dynamic where you're constantly on call and never able to disconnect. Instead, try to set clear boundaries around when and how you'll respond to messages, and avoid getting sucked into endless back-and-forth conversations. In conclusion, keeping interactions short and minimal can help you stay productive, focused, and mentally healthy. By avoiding unnecessary conversations, ignoring people when necessary, and withholding virtual responses, you can take control of your digital interactions and find a more balanced approach to communication."},{"instruction":"Article III of the United States Constitution does not specify the number of justices.

After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or nonobligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.","output":"Title: Brood Parasitism in Birds"},{"instruction":"Microsoft #39;s chief counsel, briefing reporters in the leadup to a European Union court hearing this week, said Monday he remains hopeful the software giant #39;s European antitrust case can be settled.
