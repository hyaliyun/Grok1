People have become more detached from their real-life connections, resulting in high levels of stress and frustration. Users are often overwhelmed by unrealistic social expectations, cyberbullying, and FOMO (fear of missing out) that can lead to self-esteem problems and depression. Moreover, social media can also have a detrimental impact on sleep cycles and relaxation patterns. It is not uncommon for individuals to use social media during their bedtime, leading to disrupted sleep cycles, insomnia, and fatigue, which can all have detrimental effects on mental health. Furthermore, social media platforms are tailored towards showing only the most flattering side of life, leading many individuals to develop an unhealthy relationship with perfectionism. Online competition, judgment, and negative self-talk are also significant issues that often get amplified due to social media. Therefore, it is important to take control of our relationship with social media and understand its impact on our mental state. Limiting social media usage or taking regular digital detoxes is essential to maintaining good mental health. Additionally, seeking support from trusted family members or therapists is crucial for dealing with any mental health issues related to social media.

The timing and amount of fuel injection is carefully controlled by the engine's computer to optimize performance and efficiency. 3. Exhaust - The burned fuel mixture is expelled from the engine through the exhaust system. The exhaust gases contain pollutants that must be treated before being released into the atmosphere. Engineers optimize the combustion process to maximize efficiency by adjusting factors such as the air-to-fuel ratio, timing of fuel injection and ignition, and the design of the combustion chamber.

The fundamental idea of meritocracy is to promote equal opportunities and social mobility so that anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances, can rise to the top of society through hard work, talent, and dedication. The implications of a meritocratic system for society are significant. In theory, it creates a level playing field where everyone has an equal shot at success. This can foster a sense of equality and fairness, which can contribute to social stability and cohesion. It also creates an incentive for people to work hard and strive for excellence, which can lead to greater innovation, productivity, and growth. However, there are also some potential downsides to meritocracy. One of the main critiques is that it can be difficult to measure merit objectively, and there is a risk of bias and favoritism if those in power are the ones deciding who has merit. Additionally, a society based purely on merit can lack empathy and support for those who fall behind, leading to a growing economic and social divide. Therefore, some argue that a balance should be found between merit-based selection and the provision of a safety net for those who fail to reach the top."},{"instruction":"Describe the Mitsui Chemicals' portfolio of products and services.","output":"Mitsui Chemicals offers a diverse portfolio of products and services, including petrochemicals, basic chemicals, functional polymeric materials, films and sheets, health care, and environmental solutions."},{"instruction":"What are the economic impacts of Border rivers on local communities and economies?","output":"Border rivers can have both positive and negative economic impacts on local communities and economies.

Social media played a decisive role in shaping the 2018 Brazilian presidential election. The primary candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, had a dominant social media presence, with nearly eight million followers on Facebook, four million on Twitter, and over one million on Instagram.
