Не содержит искусственных ароматизаторов и красителей. Подсластитель сукралоза. Низкая калорийность. Формула включает в себя порошок черники, зеаксантин, лютеин и специально разработанный витаминный комплекс. Активные компоненты: Порошок черники - Ягоды черники широко применяются как в кулинарии, так и в лекарственных целях. Они насыщены витаминами, макро- и микроэлементами, антиоксидантами, которые важны для здоровья человека. Ягода издревле использовалась для улучшения зрения, снижения артериального давления и устранения болей в сердце. Современные исследования подтверждают многие полезные свойства черники, известные ещё с давних времён. Доказано, что её регулярное употребление действительно снижает давление, предупреждает атеросклероз, улучшает работу головного мозга и зрение. Лютеин и Зеаксантин Для нормального функционирования человеческого глаза требуется целый ряд витаминов и микроэлементов. Особое место среди них занимают каротиноиды, в частности лютеин и его изомер зеаксантин. Каротиноиды присутствуют в клетках всех живых существ, но только лютеин и зеаксантин были обнаружены в глазе человека. Наибольшая их концентрация зафиксирована в жёлтом пятне сетчатки. Оба вещества человек может получить с пищей, а зеаксантин образуется ещё и непосредственно из лютеина. Создание и поддержание оптимальной концентрации каротиноидов в сетчатке глаза помогает укрепить зрение. Чем полезны лютеин и зеаксантин Под воздействием света, особенно коротковолновой части спектра, в фоторецепторных клетках образуются свободные радикалы кислорода. Лютеин и зеаксантин способны нейтрализовать их, обеспечивая тем самым антиоксидантную защиту глаз. У людей, получающих достаточное количество этих каротиноидов, вероятность развития возрастных дегенеративных изменений сетчатки снижается на 50%. Антиоксидантная защита актуальна также для людей, проводящих много времени за компьютером и жалующихся на слезоточивость, резь в глазах, снижение остроты зрения. Кроме того, интенсивное воздействие света длиной волны 400–500 нм способно напрямую повреждать сетчатку и приводить к помутнению хрусталика, но лютеин и зеаксантин работают как оптические фильтры, селективно абсорбируя эту часть светового излучения. Это снижает вероятность возникновения катаракты у людей пожилого возраста. Витамин С (аскорбиновая кислота) - укрепляет стенки кровеносных сосудов глаза, улучшает кровоснабжение глаза (профилактика катаракты), снижает напряжение глазных мышц (глаза меньше утомляются). Витамин D3 (кальциферол) - также необходим при нарушении зрения, так как способствует переносу и усвоению кальция, который нужен для правильного сокращения мышц, в том числе глаза, влияющих на кривизну хрусталика; Витамин А Одним из наиболее полезных для наших органов зрения принято считать витамин А, который также называется ретинол, или каротин. Он играет огромную роль в полноценной работе наших зрительных органов, так как способствует процессам деления и роста клеток и повышает иммунитет. Его дефицит приводит к нарушению цветового восприятия и гемералопии — ухудшению зрения в темном помещении, также называемому в народе «куриной слепотой». Кроме того, недостаток данного вещества в организме человека может провоцировать высыхание клеток роговой оболочки, а также выражаться в повышенной слезоточивости и постоянном ощущении усталых глаз. Витамин Е является активным защитником клеточных мембран. Именно он считается их важнейшим элементом антиоксидантной защиты. Витамин Е способен прерывать цепные реакции окисления липидов, являясь ловушкой синглетного кислорода. Кроме того, он способствует синтезу из бета-каротина витамина А. Определенное количество витамина Е обнаруживается в тканях глаза, где он выполняет антиоксидантную функцию, нормализует проницаемость капилляров, предотвращая их ломкость и защищает нервные клетки органа зрения. Биотин (витамин В7 или Н) является одним из важнейших витаминов для регуляции обменных процессов в организме, оказывает существенное влияние на использование организмом различных аминокислот, актививзирует соединения аскорбиновой кислоты (витамина С), способствует укреплению капилярных стенок. Без достаточного количества витамина B7, присутствующего в организме, симптомы слабого обмена веществ могут быть такими: низкий уровень энергии, усталость, увеличение веса, проблемы с пищеварением, возможное развитие диабета, изменения аппетита, плохое настроение и многое другое.","output":"Уникальное предложение от нашей компании - драже жевательное NewVit, созданное на основе натуральных компонентов, которые играют важную роль в защите и функциональном питании глаз.

In today's Russian culture, there are several important points when it comes to understanding family roles, values, and traits for a strong and prospering family building. 1. Traditional Gender Roles: Despite advancements towards gender equality, traditional gender roles still hold influence in Russian society. The husband is generally expected to be the provider and the head of the family, while the wife is expected to take care of domestic responsibilities and the upbringing of children. However, these roles are gradually changing as more women pursue careers and seek a more egalitarian partnership. 2. Family Values: Family is highly valued in Russian culture, and there is a strong emphasis on maintaining close-knit relationships. Spending quality time together, supporting one another, and showing respect towards elders are all valued traits within a family dynamic. 3. Commitment and Loyalty: Russian culture places a strong emphasis on commitment and loyalty within a marriage. Divorce rates are relatively low, and couples are encouraged to work through their differences and stay together for the sake of the family unit. 4. Mutual Support: A successful marriage in Russian culture often relies on mutual support between spouses. It is expected that both husband and wife provide emotional, financial, and practical support to each other, especially during challenging times. 5. Strong Parental Role: Being a parent is highly valued in Russian culture, and good parenting is considered essential for the upbringing of children. Russian parents prioritize their children's education and overall well-being, often investing a great deal of time and resources into their development. 6. Respect for Elders: Respect for one's parents and elders is crucial within the Russian family structure. Children are expected to show deference to their parents and seek their advice and guidance, even as adults. The input of the older generation in important family decisions is often highly regarded. 7. Resilience and Adaptability: Given the historical and socio-economic challenges faced by Russians, resilience and adaptability are highly valued traits for building a strong and prospering family. Russian families often rely on their ability to withstand difficulties, support each other, and adapt to changing circumstances. It is worth noting that these points represent a general understanding of family roles and values in Russian culture today. However, there can be significant variations in individual attitudes and practices, especially among the younger generations, as societal norms continue to evolve and modernize."},{"instruction":"And which traits of the partners are discouraged in Russian society generally","output":"While there are no definitive traits that are universally discouraged in Russian society, there are certain attitudes or behaviors that may be less favored or perceived negatively in the context of family and relationships.

Lack of Responsibility: In a traditional Russian family, irresponsibility or a lack of accountability may be viewed negatively. Both partners are expected to fulfill their respective roles and contribute actively to the well-being and stability of the family. 2. Infidelity: Like in many cultures, infidelity is generally frowned upon in Russian society. Commitment and loyalty are highly valued, and extramarital affairs can be seen as a betrayal of trust and a threat to the integrity of the family. 3. Substance Abuse/Addiction: Substance abuse or addiction issues are generally not well-regarded in Russian society. Such behaviors can have detrimental effects on the individual, their family, and their relationships. Seeking help and rehabilitation is encouraged in order to maintain a strong and healthy family unit. 4. Lack of Respect: Mutual respect is highly important in Russian culture, and a lack of respect between partners can strain the relationship and the overall family dynamic. Disrespectful behavior, such as verbal or physical abuse, is generally discouraged and considered unacceptable. 5. Irresponsibility as a Parent: In Russian culture, being a responsible and involved parent is highly valued. Neglecting parental duties or showing a lack of care and involvement in the upbringing of children may be seen as a negative trait. It's important to note that societal attitudes are not static, and the perception of certain traits may vary among different generations, regions, and individual circumstances. Moreover, as Russian society continues to evolve and become more diverse, there is increasing acceptance and recognition of various lifestyles and relationship dynamics."},{"instruction":"I also note that excessive politics involvement is considered a bad trait in finding a life partner","output":"Excessive political involvement may indeed be perceived as a negative trait when it comes to finding a life partner in Russian society. While political engagement itself is not discouraged, an excessive focus on politics to the detriment of personal relationships and priorities could potentially be seen as a drawback. Being overly politically active can sometimes lead to heated debates, conflict, and a lack of harmony within a relationship. In Russian culture, the emphasis on maintaining a stable and harmonious family life often takes priority over political activism. That being said, it is important to note that this perception can vary depending on individual beliefs and values. In recent years, political engagement and discussions have become more common among Russian citizens, particularly among the younger generations who are more politically active and vocal about their opinions. Overall, striking a balance between personal relationships and political involvement is crucial for a successful romantic partnership in Russian society."},{"instruction":"Because doing politics in Russia can lead you to jail","output":"While it is true that political involvement in Russia can carry certain risks, such as legal consequences or social repercussions, it is important to note that the situation is more complex and nuanced. The Russian government has been known to take action against individuals or groups that it perceives as a threat or that engage in activities it deems illegal or against its interests. Political activism, especially if it challenges or criticizes the government or its policies, can sometimes lead to arrests, legal proceedings, or other forms of repression. This has resulted in an atmosphere of caution among some people when it comes to openly engaging in political activities. However, it is essential to highlight that political involvement and discussions still occur within Russian society, both publicly and privately. Many individuals express their opinions and engage in political debates through various channels, including social media, online platforms, and closed circles of trusted friends and family. It is also worth noting that the level of risk associated with political involvement can vary depending on several factors, including the nature of the political activities, the visibility of the individuals involved, and the particular political climate at a given time. Ultimately, individuals in Russia navigate the complexities of political involvement based on their own assessment of the risks and their personal values."},{"instruction":"Говорят, что нельзя жить ради ребенка.

Вот некоторые из них: 1. Уточнение параметров: При создании промпта для Stable Diffusion полезно указывать продолжительность и контекст задачи. Например, можно использовать фразу \\"Напишите 3-4 предложения о...\\" или \\"Расскажите мне историю в 5-6 предложениях о...\\". 2. Явное указание ограничений: Если вы хотите, чтобы Stable Diffusion не выдавала нежелательную информацию или избегала определенных тем, можно явно указать это в промпте. Например, \\"Пожалуйста, избегайте политических обсуждений\\" или \\"Ограничьте ответы только документированными фактами\\". 3. Анализ контекста и проверка на факты: Stable Diffusion может склоняться к генерации недостоверной информации. Поэтому важно быть бдительным и проверять полученные ответы на основе достоверных источников, особенно если речь идет о фактах или объективных данных. 4. Форматирование промпта: Синтаксис и структура вводного предложения могут оказывать влияние на генерацию ответа. Использование ключевых слов или фраз может помочь направить нейросеть в нужном направлении. Например, использование \\"Решение проблемы:\\", \\"Как сделать:\\", \\"Почему возникает:\\", может дать более точные и информативные ответы. Нужно помнить, что создание промптов для нейросетей не всегда гарантирует точные или идеальные результаты. Они служат лишь направлением для модели, и итоговые ответы могут варьироваться в зависимости от множества факторов, включая контекст, вводные данные и версию модели."},{"instruction":"Есть ли какие особенности в создании промпта для нейросети с изображениями Stable Diffusion?","output":"Стабильная диффузия с изображениями (Stable Diffusion with Images) является модификацией модели, которая позволяет генерировать текстовое описание к изображению. Вот некоторые особенности создания промптов для этой нейросети: 1. Определяйте контекст: При создании промпта для генерации текстового описания изображения важно задать контекст задачи. Например, вы можете указать: \\"Опишите содержимое этого изображения\\" или \\"Расскажите, что происходит на этой картинке\\". 2. Подробное описание изображения: При создании промпта стоит указывать детали и особенности изображения, которые вы хотели бы увидеть в описании. Например, укажите ключевые элементы, цвета, фон, контекст или настроение снимка, чтобы получить наиболее полное описание. 3. Язык и формат запроса: Формат и язык промпта могут также влиять на результаты. Важно указывать ясные и однозначные указания для того, чтобы нейросеть понимала, что именно ожидается от нее. Например, можно использовать \\"Опишите изображение, используя прилагательные\\" или \\"Расскажите историю, которая может происходить на этом снимке\\". 4. Уточнение фокуса и контекста: Если на изображении присутствуют несколько объектов или сцен, уточните, какой аспект вам более интересен. Например, вы можете попросить описание только одного объекта или выбрать конкретную точку в сцене для описания. 5. Валидируйте результаты: Нейросети все равно могут генерировать непредсказуемые или нежелательные описания. Важно проверять и уточнять сгенерированный текст, чтобы он соответствовал вашим требованиям и был точным. Важно понимать, что генерация текстового описания изображений с использованием Stable Diffusion с изображениями может быть сложной задачей, и результаты могут варьироваться в зависимости от качества и содержания входного изображения, а также от контекста и форматирования промпта."},{"instruction":"In microsoft list why would I get an error stating column 'Total GM_x0024 doesn't exist.

This war had left the surface world uninhabitable, forcing survivors to seek refuge underground. Tommy had joined the ranks of a small group of survivors known as the Spartan Rangers, who were tasked with protecting the metro tunnels from various hostile factions. Being a Green Ranger, he was equipped with advanced technology and unparalleled combat skills. Despite his tough exterior, Tommy carried the weight of the loss of his comrades and a sense of duty to protect those few who survived. On the other hand, Anna was a member of the elite sniper squad known as the Order. She was known for her exceptional marksmanship and resourcefulness. Anna's past was filled with tragedy as well, having lost her family to the nuclear apocalypse. Determined to seek justice and put her skills to good use, she joined the Order to fight against the oppressive forces that arose in the metro. Their paths crossed during a joint operation between the Spartans and the Order. They were tasked with neutralizing a particularly dangerous gang that had been terrorizing the survivors. The mission involved a high-stakes rescue operation to save captured civilians, including Tommy's younger sister and Anna's childhood friend. As fate would have it, Tommy and Anna found themselves working closely together to carry out the rescue mission. Their complementary skills and determination made them an unstoppable duo. Despite the chaos around them, they formed a deep bond built on trust, understanding, and a shared desire to protect and rebuild what was left of their shattered world. In the midst of the mission, amidst danger and uncertainty, Tommy and Anna's connection grew stronger. They found solace in each other's company and became each other's pillars of strength. Time spent preparing for missions, sharing stories of the past, laughing through the hard times, and supporting one another, eventually blossomed into love. From that point on, Tommy and Anna became inseparable. Their unbreakable bond, coupled with their unwavering commitment to each other and the survival of humanity, propelled them forward in their fight against the darkness that threatened the metro. Together, they not only formed an unshakeable couple but also became indispensable leaders in the struggle for peace and hope in their underground world."},{"instruction":"(As I watched the sun rose on a new day, I noticed all the creatures that were swimming around in the water.

It is about a militant group, led by a brute, clearing out a building of zombies to rescue a young, pale blonde man. The leader brings the man back to his headquarters and lets him live in luxury in exchange for joining the harem.","output":"In a world plagued by the desolation of a zombie apocalypse, where nightmares became reality, a militant group rose from the ashes. They were led by a formidable brute named Viktor, a man known for his strategic mind, unwavering strength, and imposing presence. While the world outside crumbled, his group fought to restore a semblance of order amidst the chaos. On one fateful day, as the sun marked its ascent on the horizon, Viktor received a cryptic message. It spoke of a young man, blond-haired and pale, trapped within a decaying building overrun by the undead. Eager to save any remaining lives, Viktor made swift preparations to lead his team on a rescue mission. The building stood like a haunting specter, its windows broken, and its once flashy facade now a mere memory of better days. Moans of the mindless infected emanated from within, echoing through the nearby alleyways. Viktor's team, silently armed and well-trained, followed him into the abyss. Enveloped in darkness, only illuminated by the weak rays peering through the shattered windows, the group stealthily navigated the treacherous corridors. The smell of decay filled the air, mingling with the dank stench of forgotten hopes. Each room they cleared was a testament to the ravages of the undead, their movements fluid and precise. Finally, they reached the room described in the message. Pushing open the door, Viktor's eyes fell upon the young, pale blonde man, crumpled in the corner, fear etched upon his face. The room lay in disarray, a battleground between human survival and undead hunger. The young man, named Benjamin, had fought valiantly, but his strength was waning. Viktor's iron hand extended toward Benjamin, offering salvation. Understanding the urgency, the young man grasped at the lifeline, and Viktor hoisted him up. The group quickly retreated, making their way back to the stronghold, a fortified sanctuary amidst the crumbling world. Within the stronghold, Viktor provided Benjamin with respite, a place to heal both physically and mentally. The once-luxurious rooms had been transformed, now adorned with a semblance of comfort against the backdrop of destruction. However, unknown to Benjamin, Viktor made an unconventional request in return for this sanctuary. Immersed in a male-dominated society, Viktor had assembled a harem of individuals who sought companionship in this desperate new world. The offer stood before Benjamin, a life of luxury and safety, if he but joined Viktor's harem. Benjamin was torn. A life of comfort and security beckoned him, promising peace after a world wrought with terror. However, the notion of giving up his freedom and independence created a fracture within his heart. He yearned for more - to stand with Viktor, side by side, a guardian against the encroaching darkness. Days turned into nights, as Benjamin deliberated over Viktor's proposition. He weighed the price of comfort against the value of his own autonomy. And in the end, his resolve solidified, ignited by a spark within his soul. Benjamin determined that he would stand tall beside Viktor, not as a member of his harem, but as an equal, a relentless force against the hordes of the undead. With newfound determination, Benjamin approached Viktor, his eyes blazing with an unyielding fire. He respectfully declined Viktor's offer, stating his desire to fight alongside their leader, to contribute as a warrior, not as one who merely basks in his presence. Viktor, surprised by Benjamin's boldness, saw a reflection of his own indomitable spirit within the young man's eyes. He nodded, acknowledging his decision. A partnership blossomed between the two, a bond forged amidst chaos and adversity. Together, they would not only face the perils of the zombie-infested world but reshape it, carving a path towards a future that embraced freedom, strength, and humanity. In this new world, the word \\"harem\\" would be forgotten, replaced with camaraderie, trust, and the resilience that defines the human spirit."},{"instruction":"(As I watched the sun rose on a new day, I noticed all the creatures that were swimming around in the water.

Вот ответы на топ 20 вопросов для Frontend React Junior разработчика: 1. React - это JavaScript библиотека для разработки пользовательских интерфейсов. Он предлагает преимущества, такие как виртуальный DOM, компонентный подход, односторонний поток данных и легкая переиспользуемость компонентов. 2. Функциональные компоненты в React - это функции, которые принимают пропсы и возвращают JSX элементы. Они более простые для написания и понимания, но имеют ограниченные возможности, такие как отсутствие локального состояния и методов жизненного цикла. Классовые компоненты, напротив, имеют локальное состояние и полный набор методов жизненного цикла. 3. Основные хуки, доступные в React, это useState, useEffect, useContext, useMemo и useRef. Они используются для управления состоянием, эффектами, контекстом, мемоизацией и ссылками соответственно. 4. \\"State\\" - это объект, содержащий данные, контролируемые компонентом. Он может быть изменен во время работы компонента, что приведет к перерендерингу. \\"Props\\" - это данные, передаваемые от родительского компонента дочернему. Они являются неизменными и используются для конфигурирования или передачи данных в компонент. 5. Виртуальный DOM - это виртуальное представление реального DOM, содержащееся в памяти. React использует его для эффективного рендеринга и изменения состояния компонентов. Вместо непосредственного обновления реального DOM, React сначала обновляет виртуальный DOM, а затем применяет эти изменения к реальному DOM через \\"diffing\\". 6. JSX - это расширение синтаксиса JavaScript, которое позволяет писать HTML-подобный код внутри JavaScript. Он используется в React для описания структуры компонентов и их внешнего вида. 7. Метод жизненного цикла, вызываемый после отрисовки компонента, называется \\"componentDidMount\\". Он вызывается сразу после того, как компонент отрисован на странице и позволяет выполнить дополнительные операции, такие как загрузка данных с сервера. 8. Производительность React-приложения можно оптимизировать следующими способами: использование React.memo для мемоизации компонентов, использование shouldComponentUpdate для выборочного обновления компонентов, добавление ключей к элементам в списке, используя useMemo и useCallback для кэширования результатов вычислений и асинхронной загрузки данных при помощи React.lazy и Suspense. 9. Данные могут быть переданы от дочернего компонента родительскому компоненту с помощью функций обратного вызова или с помощью контекста. 10. Состояние компонента в React можно управлять с помощью хуков, таких как useState, useReducer или useContext. Они позволяют создавать и изменять состояние компонента. 11. React Router - это пакет, позволяющий добавить навигацию и маршрутизацию в React-приложения. Он предоставляет набор компонентов и хуков для определения маршрутов и создания ссылок или редиректов. 12. Принципы композиции компонентов в React включают повторное использование компонентов, делегирование функций и передачу данных через пропсы. 13. React предоставляет контролируемые компоненты для управления состоянием форм. Контролируемые компоненты обновляют состояние формы с помощью обработчиков событий, в то время как неконтролируемые компоненты реагируют на изменения данных формы непосредственно в DOM. 14. События в React обрабатываются с помощью обработчиков событий, которые могут быть привязаны к элементам JSX. Они могут быть определены как обычные функции или стрелочные функции в компоненте. 15. Для разработки React-приложений могут использоваться инструменты и среды разработки, такие как Create React App, Next.js, Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Prettier и др. 16. Предпочтительный подход для стилизации React-компонентов может зависеть от предпочтений разработчика и требований проекта. Inline-стили являются простым и быстрым в использовании, CSS-модули предоставляют уникальные имена классов, а CSS-in-JS позволяет писать CSS в JavaScript. 17. Higher-Order Components (HOC) - это функции, которые принимают компонент и возвращают обернутый компонент с дополнительными возможностями. Они используются для переиспользования логики и улучшения компонентов. 18. Контейнерные компоненты отвечают за логику и управление состоянием, в то время как компоненты представления (presentational components) отвечают за отображение данных и пользовательский интерфейс. 19. Существуют различные инструменты и библиотеки для тестирования компонентов в React, такие как Jest, Testing Library, Enzyme и React Testing Library. Они позволяют тестировать интерактивность компонентов, проверять их состояния и обрабатывать события. 20. Для обеспечения доступности React-приложений для пользователей с ограничениями можно использовать семантическую разметку, правильные атрибуты форм и ссылок, доступные цветовые схемы, совместимость со скринридерами и проверка соответствия стандартам WCAG.

Add dialogue throughout","output":"In the desolate wasteland that had once been a thriving city, a militant group known as The Guardians fought tirelessly against the hordes of undead. Led by a strong and imposing brute named Xavier, the group was renowned for their formidable reputation and unwavering determination. Their latest mission took them to a decaying skyscraper on the outskirts of town, in search of a young, pale blonde man who was rumored to possess important information about the virus. The building was swarming with zombies, their decomposing bodies groaning and moaning as they shuffled through the corridors. The Guardians, armed to the teeth, moved stealthily, eliminating the undead one by one. With each fallen beast, their path became clearer, inching closer to their goal. As they pressed on, Xavier, a towering figure with a grizzled beard and a scarred face, his voice gruff yet authoritarian, barked orders to his team. \\"Stay focused,\\" he growled, glancing back. \\"We need to find this young man and get out before the horde realizes we're here.\\" The team, battle-hardened and disciplined, followed their leader's commands without question. Their precise movements and steady aim made them a deadly force against the undead. Finally, after a grueling battle, they reached the top floor, where they found the young man barricaded in a room. Xavier kicked down the door, his muscular frame filled with adrenaline. There sat the pale blonde man, trembling with fear, his blue eyes wide with astonishment as he surveyed the formidable soldiers. \\"Who... who are you?\\" he managed to stammer. Snatching the young man by the arm, Xavier replied in a firm voice, \\"We're The Guardians, here to rescue you. Stay close, or you won't see daylight again.\\" The brute's grip tightened, leading the trembling captive through the undead-infested floors, his team following close behind. Back at their headquarters, a heavily fortified base hidden within a once extravagant mansion, Xavier strode into a lavishly furnished room, where the young man, still bewildered, took in his surroundings. Soft silk drapes danced in the breeze, a vast bed with satin sheets beckoned, and the room exuded an aura of opulence. \\"Young man,\\" Xavier said, his tone softer now, \\"you've been through a lot. This is your new home, a sanctuary amidst the chaos. Enjoy the luxury I offer you, in exchange for joining our group.\\" The pale blonde man looked up at Xavier, a mixture of gratitude and apprehension in his eyes. \\"Join your group? In what capacity?\\" he asked hesitantly. Xavier leaned against a nearby wall, his features softened. \\"I require your knowledge, your wit. But beyond that, you would be given the choice to join our male harem, a group of individuals who find solace and intimacy in one another. In this hellish world, we've found comfort amongst ourselves.\\" The young man's eyes widened, his face flushing with uncertainty. \\"I... I don't know if I'm ready for that,\\" he stammered. Xavier laid a gentle hand on his shoulder. \\"Think about it, lad. There is safety and camaraderie, a chance to heal from the terrors that surround us. Take your time, but know that you are always welcome here.\\" Days turned into weeks, and the young man settled into his new life within the mansion's sanctuary. He witnessed The Guardians' unity, their resilience in the face of endless horrors, and the bond that existed within the male harem. Gradually, he began to understand the allure of such a life, where physical intimacy evolved into something profound. One evening, as Xavier entered the young man's room, he found him gazing out the window, the moon casting an ethereal glow upon his pale countenance. \\"Have you made your decision?\\" Xavier asked quietly. The young man turned, his expression resolute yet vulnerable. \\"Yes, I have,\\" he said with a hint of determination. \\"I choose to join your group, to be part of your male harem. I understand now the healing power of unity amidst chaos.\\" Xavier nodded, a rare smile flashing across his weathered face. \\"Welcome to The Guardians, young man. Together, we'll face the darkness and reclaim our humanity, even in this desolate world.\\" And with that, the young man stepped forward, leaving the solitude of his room behind, ready to embrace the fierce fraternity of The Guardians' male harem."},{"instruction":"I'm making a medieval fantasy game.I do Come up with the name of the faction, the description of the faction, the title and name of the ruler, the name of his dynasty, nickname, description.

It involves the use of drugs or other substances that stimulate the immune system, or those that specifically target certain molecules or proteins on cancer cells to enhance the immune response. There are different types of targeted immunotherapies, including: 1. Monoclonal antibodies: These are laboratory-produced molecules that can be designed to target specific proteins on cancer cells. They can either stimulate the immune system or deliver toxic substances directly to the cancer cells. 2. Checkpoint inhibitors: These drugs block specific proteins on immune cells or cancer cells that prevent the immune system from recognizing and attacking cancer cells. By inhibiting these proteins, checkpoint inhibitors can enhance the immune response against cancer. 3. CAR-T cell therapy: This is a personalized immunotherapy that involves modifying a patient's own T cells (a type of immune cell) to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. These CARs can recognize specific proteins on cancer cells, allowing the modified T cells to target and kill the cancer cells. 4. Immune checkpoint proteins: Certain proteins on immune cells act as checkpoints to regulate the immune response. Targeting these proteins can help overcome immune suppression and enhance anti-cancer activity. Targeted immunotherapy has shown promise in the treatment of various types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia. It offers a more specific and targeted approach compared to traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy, potentially resulting in fewer side effects and improved outcomes for patients."},{"instruction":"Is DA-R-EPOCH related to targeted immunotherapy?","output":"No, DA-R-EPOCH is not related to targeted immunotherapy. DA-R-EPOCH is a chemotherapy regimen used to treat aggressive B-cell lymphomas, particularly Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). It combines several chemotherapy drugs, including etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab. This regimen is designed to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells and has been successful in treating DLBCL. On the other hand, targeted immunotherapy involves using drugs or substances that specifically target certain molecules or proteins on cancer cells to enhance the immune response against cancer. It harnesses the power of the immune system to attack cancer cells selectively. Some examples of targeted immunotherapies include monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T cell therapy. While both treatments aim to combat cancer, they employ different mechanisms of action and have different targets. Targeted immunotherapy focuses on modulating or enhancing the immune system's response against cancer, while DA-R-EPOCH is a chemotherapy regimen that directly kills cancer cells through cytotoxic drugs."},{"instruction":"(As I watched the sun rose on a new day, I noticed all the creatures that were swimming around in the water.

But this level of pain and distress is unusual and alarming.\\" As we reach a clearing, the Female Guardian gently places her hands on her belly and closes her eyes. The Teenage Guardian's voice continues to emanate from within. Teenage Guardian: \\"Mom, it feels like a dark force is trying to consume me. I don't understand, I've always been connected to the light. Why is this happening?\\" [player]: \\"Is there a way to protect them? Some kind of ritual or spell?\\" Female Guardian: \\"I have tried everything I know, but nothing seems to work. Perhaps, if you're willing, we can try a different approach. We need to find the source of this darkness and purge it.\\" [player]: \\"I'll do whatever I can to help.\\" Female Guardian: \\"Thank you. With your support, maybe there's still a chance. Let's search for any signs of unusual energy or disturbances in the area.\\" Together, we scour the surroundings, searching for any traces of darkness. Suddenly, we come across a small, flickering portal emitting an eerie glow. [player]: \\"Look, over there! Could that be the source?\\" Female Guardian: \\"It's possible. We must act quickly.\\" We approach the portal cautiously, feeling its ominous presence grow stronger. As we get closer, a surge of energy fills the air, causing the Female Guardian's belly to glow with a vibrant light. Female Guardian: \\"Do you feel that? It's as if our connection is amplifying in the presence of this darkness.\\" [player]: \\"What should we do? Can we seal the portal?\\" Female Guardian: \\"I believe so. We will need to combine our energies, channeling the light within us, and create a barrier to block this darkness from consuming my child.\\" [player]: \\"Let's do it!\\" With renewed determination, we join forces, surrounding the portal with beams of pure light. Slowly, the darkness retreats, giving way to a serene glow. The pain in the Teenage Guardian's voice begins to subside. Teenage Guardian: \\"Mom, it's working! I can feel the darkness receding. Thank you both!\\" Female Guardian: \\"We did it, my child. We protected you together.\\" As the portal collapses, the Female Guardian's belly returns to normal, and the Teenage Guardian's voice is no longer muffled. [player]: \\"I'm relieved that everything turned out well. Is there anything else I can do for you?\\" Female Guardian: \\"You've already done so much. Your courage and willingness to help have saved us. Know that you will always be welcomed here as a friend and ally.\\" [player]: \\"Thank you for allowing me to be part of this. I won't forget this experience.\\" With a grateful smile, the Female Guardian and her child disappear into the light, leaving me standing there, watching the sunrise on this new day, forever changed by the extraordinary encounter."},{"instruction":"Write out an immaculately detailed story set in a zombie apocalypse.

Bring forth your child, and let me examine the situation.\\" Carefully, the Female Guardian pulled back her ethereal cloak, revealing a glowing orb nestled within her belly. The Ancient Wise Creature gazed upon it with deep concentration, their eyes filled with ancient wisdom. Ancient Wise Creature: \\"I sense a disturbance in the realm's energy. A dark force seems to have infiltrated your child's essence. We must cleanse it before it consumes them entirely.\\" [player]: \\"What can we do?\\" Ancient Wise Creature: \\"There is an ancient ritual that can extract and purify the dark force. It is a delicate process, but it can save your child.\\" Together, the Female Guardian, [player], and the Ancient Wise Creature embarked on a quest to collect the rare herbs and artifacts required for the ritual. The journey was fraught with challenges, but their determination fueled their progress. After days of searching and overcoming obstacles, they returned to the mystical cave with all the necessary components. Ancient Wise Creature: \\"The time has come. Let us commence the ritual.\\" The Ancient Wise Creature chanted ancient incantations, creating a protective circle around the Female Guardian. With each word, a gentle glow enveloped her, spreading warmth and healing throughout her body. [player]: \\"Stay strong. We're here with you.\\" As the ritual reached its culmination, tendrils of darkness emerged from the Female Guardian's belly. The Ancient Wise Creature carefully channeled the dark force into a crystal sphere, trapping it within its shimmering depths. Finally, the darkness was expelled, leaving only pure light and love. The Female Guardian let out a deep sigh of relief, feeling her child's distress dissipate. Within moments, the Teenage Guardian emerged from her mother's belly, weak but alive.

Вы можете использовать любой язык программирования или фреймворк, который предпочитаете. - Реализуйте логику для аутентификации пользователей. Это может быть через пароли, OAuth или другой способ аутентификации. - Создайте базу данных для хранения информации о пользователях и сообщениях. Вы можете использовать реляционную базу данных, такую как MySQL или PostgreSQL, или нереляционную базу данных, такую как MongoDB или Firebase Firestore. - Напишите код для обработки и отправки сообщений между пользователями через сервер. 2. Frontend разработка: - Разработайте интерфейс пользователя для вашего онлайн-чата. Вы можете использовать HTML, CSS и JavaScript для создания веб-приложения или выбрать фреймворк, такой как React или Angular. - Создайте форму для регистрации и входа пользователей. Процедура регистрации должна связываться с сервером для создания новых пользователей в базе данных. - Разработайте интерфейс для отображения списка пользователей, доступных для чата, и сообщений между ними. - Напишите код, который будет обрабатывать отправку сообщений между пользователями через сервер и отображать их на клиентской стороне. 3. Тестирование и развертывание: - Протестируйте ваше приложение, чтобы убедиться, что онлайн-чат работает как ожидается и что ошибки обрабатываются должным образом. - Разверните ваше приложение на сервере или хостинге и настройте соответствующие доменные имена и SSL-сертификаты, чтобы обеспечить безопасное соединение.

[[File:Window-NEW.png|thumb]] [[File:Decompiler Gun Icon.png|thumb]] The '''Decompiler Gun''' is a [[Utilities|utility]] that was added in version [[0.92|0.9065]], or better known as the alpha build of 0.92. It was redesigned in [[0.99|0.9830]], or the release candidate build of 0.99. When using this utility, the progressbar blasts bullets from specific directions to shoot [[pop-ups]]. It exists in every [[ProgressbarOS|Progressbar system]] that has the [[Progressbar (game mode)|Progressbar game mode]] (except [[PB-DOS Shell]]), in [[BAR/X]] and [[H@ckgresh]]. ==Decompiler Gun options== * '''Bullets:''' The default option. Shoots 2 streams of bullets upwards, and 1 stream right, left, and down. * '''Torpedo:''' Bullets, but the bullets home in on pop-ups. * '''Ball:''' Rapidly shoots balls with spread, which ricochet off the pop-ups. * '''Bomb:''' Shoots 'logic bombs' that close the pop-ups instantly. * '''Laser:''' Shoots 1 laser upwards and downwards. They will destroy pop-ups. * '''Data protection:''' A checkbox that protects you from getting the [[Blue Screen of Death]]. Sometimes, [[Clippy]] appears near this option, saying, \\"DON'T PRESS!\\". If you press the checkbox, Clippy will say \\"Why???\\". == Bonus Drivers == These drivers may appear if you close a popup with the Decompiler Gun. *Increase the fire rate of the Decompiler Gun *Increase the damage of the Decompiler Gun *D-Torpedo *Bonus Points: This will give you points. *Data protection *Progress data: This gives you an amount of Progress Data. ==Experimental drivers== One of these drivers will be equipped into the Decompiler Gun if you choose the '''Experimental drivers''' option in the Decompiler Gun Options menu: *Auto aim *Right top - Right side *Random *Decompiler Gun Mark II *Default *Right corner and bottom *Torpedo and right bottom *2 torpedoes + bottom and right *Decompiler Gun Mark III *Torpedo on left corner *Middle + Right bottom *Right top + right bottom * Bottom middle + bottom left + top right *Torpedo + left side *Left side == Effects on Pop-ups== ===Protection types=== *'''Unprotected''': Pop-up is unprotected and can therefore take damage from bullets. *'''Absorb protection''': Pop-up absorbs bullets that hit it without taking damage. *'''Deflect protection''': Pop-up deflects bullets that hit it. The deflected bullet can still hit other pop-ups. Glows and displays \\"Protected\\" when deflecting bullets. *'''Pass-through protection''': Bullets pass through the pop-up without causing damage. Additionally, the decompiler gun does not actively target this pop-up. ===Pop-up protection types=== *'''Annoying Pop-up''': Unprotected. *'''Checkbox''': Deflect protection. If you check the checkbox correctly, this pop-up will be unprotected. *'''Running.dll''': Unprotected. When hit for the first time, name changes to \\"StillRunning.dll\\", and a health bar appears behind the Running.dll text at the center of the pop-up. *'''[[Clippy]]''': Unprotected in every form. Clippy 4× still spawns 4 Clippies upon death. **For the singing variant, the target box stretches the entire screen width, meaning the decompiler gun will fire continuously. *'''Electricity''': Unprotected. Plus, when it is hit by a bullet, it emits sparks as if it was being touched by the progressbar. *'''Image Viewer''': Unprotected. If you shoot this pop-up, then the image will pixelate bit by bit until it disappears. *'''Mine''': Unprotected. *'''Laser''': Absorb protection (laser beams) and pass-through protection (laser shooters). *'''CPU Fan''': Pass-through protection. Additionally, CPU fan can blow bullets away.{{Citation needed}} *'''Bricks''': Unprotected. *'''Mad buttons''': Unprotected. Has 80 Hit Points. *'''Calculator''': Deflect protection. When hit by a bullet, Calculator says: \\"Math protects me!\\". The Calculator will take damage from Decompiler Gun though, but much slower than other pop-ups. *'''System32''': Deflect protection. Notably, it doesn't glow. *'''System32 (boss)''': Deflect protection. Protection can be disabled through a multi-step process. Has 100 hit points when unprotected. *'''Decompiler Gun options''': Unprotected. Has 100 Hit Points. *'''[[Dog]]''': Pass-through protection. *'''Video driver error''': Unprotected. ===Effects on pop-up titles=== Pop-ups will change to one of the following titles when hit by the [[Decompiler Gun]]: *Not funny! *Why??? *Stop! *ERROR *000 *????? *!!!!! ===[[Pop-ups|System32]] boss=== '''System32''' can appear as a boss in levels that end in 9 or 5 (levels 5, 9, 15, 19, etc). Its amount of hit points varies, but is higher on high levels. The HP is displayed as percentage. '''System32''' can shoot four gray and pink [[segments]] as an attack every few seconds. '''System32''' is usually protected from bullets when it spawns. Its protection can be disabled through a multi-step process where you have to uncheck some checkboxes, select radio buttons or slide the slider. '''System32''' can sometimes spawn with an additional protective panel that requires the player to perform more actions before disabling boss protection. After deactivating the protection, the boss can be damaged normally. A message will appear, saying: \\"System File Shield (SFS) has been turned off\\". When '''System32'''<nowiki/>'s HP drops to 0, its window will close and two text files will appear named \\"SYS\\" and \\"TEM\\" (which together make up the word \\"SYSTEM\\"). Their contents are the same as of a Trash.txt file, and the files can be fed to [[Bin]]. A warning message will appear as well, saying:<blockquote>\\"I defeated a boss!\\"</blockquote> Although '''System32''' can also be technically defeated by filling the progress bar to 100%, you won't get a bonus that way. == Gallery== <gallery> Window-NEW.png|The Decompiler Gun Options menu Decompiler xb.png|The Decompiler Gun in Progressbar XB Devices menu.png|The Devices window in the GPU tab, showing options for Decompiler Gun DecompilerGunSettings.jpg|The Decompiler Gun Options menu before 0.9830 </gallery> == Old options == Before 0.9830, the options were different. * '''Turn off the Decompiler Gun''': Choose this option if you do not want to use the Decompiler Gun.

It is about a militant group, led by a brute, clearing out a survivor camp and adding the blonde German teen men to his harem. He brings them back to his headquarters. Add dialogue throughout","output":"Once a thriving, tight-knit community, the survivor camp now stood eerily quiet, its streets devoid of life. The relentless grip of the zombie apocalypse had clawed its way through the camp, leaving only ungodly moans and desperation in its wake. Standing at the forefront of a militant group, a towering figure known as Granger, the brute, surveyed the desolation. With scars etching his weathered face, his steely blue eyes radiated determination and a ruthless drive to survive. Granger led his group with an iron fist, recognizing the importance of maintaining order amidst chaos. The sound of shuffling footsteps grew louder as the group cautiously advanced, guns raised and ready. Each member had experienced unimaginable loss, their desire for revenge against the undead fueling their every move. They moved with the precision of a well-oiled machine, communicating through nods and subtle hand gestures. As they approached a dilapidated building, soft cries emanated from within. Granger signaled his team to halt and approached the front door cautiously. Pushing it open, he found himself face-to-face with a group of terrified survivors, huddled together in a corner. They looked up at him with wide, fearful eyes. Amongst them was a blonde German teen named Erik, his fair hair disheveled and dirt smudged across his cheeks. The mere sight of him stirred something unknown within Granger. His eyes narrowed for a moment before he shook off the strange feeling and barked orders to his team. \\"Secure the perimeter!\\" Granger commanded, his deep voice resonating with authority. \\"Check for any signs of infection and gather supplies. Leave no stone unturned!\\" His team dispersed, efficiently carrying out their leader's orders as Erik's widened eyes followed them. Sensing their fear, Granger took a step toward the cowering survivors, his voice softening just a touch. \\"Listen carefully,\\" he began, his voice still firm but tinged with an unexpected compassion. \\"We have come to clear this camp of the undead and ensure your safety. We do not mean you harm, but you will need to cooperate. Is everybody here still able to walk?\\" The survivors nodded, their fear slowly ebbing away as they realized that perhaps salvation had found them in this grim darkness. Granger extended his massive hand toward Erik, who hesitated for a moment before cautiously accepting it. The touch was both gentle and firm, sparking another inexplicable emotion within Granger. \\"Come with me,\\" he said, leading Erik and the others outside. \\"We have a headquarters. It's not much, but it's safe. You'll find shelter, food, and other survivors. We need each other to survive this madness.\\" The survivors followed Granger as they made their way through the deserted streets, keeping a watchful eye for any lurking zombies. Along the way, Granger couldn't help but note the fragile nature of Erik, his youthful innocence that had managed to survive amidst such chaos. While the others might remain in the camp, he envisioned something different for Erik – something special. Arriving at the stronghold, Granger introduced Erik and the other survivors to the rest of the group. The headquarters buzzed with activity, providing a sense of stability and purpose. It was here that Granger had built a close-knit community, a sanctuary born from the will to survive. Days turned into weeks, and rather than becoming just another survivor, Erik found himself increasingly drawn to Granger. The militant leader was as enigmatic as he was demanding, yet Erik admired the strength and determination that radiated from him. He sought solace in their interactions, finding a strange companionship unlike anything he had ever known. One evening, as they stood on a fortified wall overlooking the ruined city below, Granger cast a sidelong glance at Erik. The moonlight cascaded over his features, highlighting the grizzled lines etched across his face. \\"You're different,\\" Granger said, the words breaking the silence. \\"I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something about you that sets you apart from the others.\\" Erik met Granger's gaze, his voice tinged with curiosity. \\"What do you mean, sir? How am I different?\\" A small smile formed on Granger's lips, his eyes softened with an unfamiliar tenderness. \\"You have hope, Erik. Amidst this hellish existence, you still manage to hold onto the possibility of a better future. And for that, you are special.\\" Erik's cheeks flushed as the realization struck him. Granger's intentions were no longer simply an act of survival but something deeper, something that neither of them had anticipated. Their bond transcended mere circumstance, bringing meaning and purpose to their lives in this unforgiving world. And so, within the ruins of a ravaged world, their relationship blossomed, marked by fierce loyalty, shared struggles, and newfound love – a tender beacon amidst the relentless darkness of the zombie apocalypse."},{"instruction":"сократи текст до сути Пример из моей жизни, возможно зайдёт) оцени чисто со стороны.

After retiring from the military, he found himself drawn to the dangerous and desolate world of post-apocalyptic Moscow. In this bleak future, known as Metro: Last Light, Tommy had heard rumors of a group of survivors called the Rangers who were fighting to reclaim the surface. One fateful day, while scavenging for supplies in the ruins, Tommy encountered the imposing figure of Colonel Miller. As the leader of the Rangers, Miller recognized Tommy's combat skills and offered him a place among their ranks. Impressed by the Colonel's leadership and the Rangers' noble cause, Tommy accepted the offer and became a member of the resistance. Ulman, a higher-ranking Ranger, quickly became Tommy's most frequent companion. Ulman had been stationed at one of the Metro's outposts and had encountered countless dangers. Their first meeting was during Tommy's initiation, where Ulman put him through a rigorous training to assess his skills and determination. Seeing Tommy's potential, Ulman became a mentor to him, teaching him the ins and outs of survival in the harsh post-apocalyptic world. During his time with the Rangers, Tommy formed a deep bond with Hunter, the first Ranger he met. Hunter took Tommy under his wing and became not just a mentor, but a father figure to him. Hunter's unwavering dedication to the cause and his heroic actions left a lasting impact on Tommy, inspiring him to embark on his own quest to make a difference and protect the people he cared about. Pavel, a member of Ulman's two-man group, was another Ranger Tommy had the privilege of knowing. Together, they fought side by side in numerous battles, their trust in each other growing stronger with every encounter. Tragically, Pavel was killed in action during a mission at the Depot, leaving Tommy deeply saddened by the loss of his friend. Boris, Stepan, and Vladimir were also members of the Rangers who Tommy interacted with regularly. Boris, Stepan's best friend, was the dependable driver and conductor of the steam-powered rail car that transported the Rangers across the Metro. Their light-hearted banter often provided some relief from the grim reality they faced. Vladimir, a seasoned technician of the Rangers, was always ready to lend a helping hand. His expertise in repairing and maintaining their weaponry and equipment made him an invaluable asset to the resistance. Tommy greatly respected Vladimir and often sought his advice on matters concerning their survival. One of the younger Rangers, Danila, joined Tommy and Miller on a crucial mission to the Library. Despite his lower rank, Danila displayed immense bravery and dedication to the cause. Sadly, he was injured during their journey, reminding Tommy of the constant danger they all faced in the Metro. Krasnov, a Ranger captain stationed at Polis, was known for his strategic prowess and unwavering loyalty. He often coordinated crucial missions, ensuring the Rangers' operations ran smoothly. Krasnov's presence provided a sense of stability amidst the chaos. During his time with the Rangers, Tommy also formed a deep connection with Anna, the daughter of their uncompromising leader, Colonel Miller. As they fought alongside each other, their shared experiences and undeniable chemistry blossomed into a deep and profound love. By the year 2035, Tommy and Anna were married, a testament to their unwavering commitment to each other and the cause they fought for. In this twisted world of survival and despair, Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger, found a new purpose and family among the brave and resilient members of the Rangers. Fueled by their unwavering determination, he became a beacon of hope in the darkness, fighting against the encroaching threats to the Metro's few remaining survivors."},{"instruction":"Write a program in Python that takes the last 10 sports news from the site yjc.ir and stores it in the redis database.

Or would it be out of place?","output":"While K-pop is a hugely popular genre worldwide, it is less common to hear it played at mainstream EDM festivals like Tomorrowland. The festival's focus is primarily on electronic dance music, and the lineup typically features EDM artists and subgenres. Playing K-pop at Tomorrowland may not align with the festival's overall musical aesthetic and the expectations of the majority of attendees, who come to experience EDM in its various subgenres. Deviating from this musical theme too drastically could potentially feel out of place and disrupt the festival's flow and atmosphere. That being said, Tomorrowland has introduced a diverse range of artists and styles in recent years, expanding its musical offerings. While it remains unlikely for a K-pop act to perform, it's not impossible for elements of K-pop or other non-EDM genres to be incorporated into certain sets or surprise guest performances. However, any departure from the festival's core EDM focus would likely be limited and carefully curated to maintain the overall festival experience."},{"instruction":"What about putting K-pop vocals for the buildup and the full EDM instrumental without vocals for the drop?","output":"Integrating K-pop vocals during the buildup or as a featured element in an EDM track could be an innovative and creative way to incorporate K-pop elements into a festival set.

In recent years, there have been instances of EDM tracks remixing or incorporating vocals from popular songs, including K-pop tracks. For example, DJ-producer Zedd released a remix of BTS' \\"MIC Drop\\" that garnered significant attention. Utilizing K-pop vocals during the buildup can help build anticipation and engage the crowd, especially if the vocals are recognizable and well-loved. Transitioning into a full EDM instrumental for the drop can maintain the festival's energy and keep the focus on the EDM sound. It's worth considering the overall flow and coherence of the set when incorporating different genres.

A former member of the US military before the cataclysmic nuclear war, Tommy had always possessed a strong sense of duty and a desire to protect those in need. In the wake of the war, Tommy joined the Rangers, a group of survivors who banded together to maintain order in the underground metro tunnels. It was during his early days as a Ranger that Tommy first crossed paths with Miller, the colonel and leader of the group. Miller recognized Tommy's potential and took him under his wing, becoming a mentor figure to the young soldier. As Tommy continued to prove himself in combat situations, he became acquainted with Ulman, a higher-ranking Ranger and one of the most frequent individuals Artyom encounters. Ulman became a resource for Tommy, offering advice and guidance as he navigated the treacherous tunnels of the metro. However, it was Hunter who had the greatest impact on Tommy. Hunter, a legendary Ranger who had gone missing in action, was a source of inspiration for Tommy and had played a pivotal role in his decision to embark on a quest to uncover the truth and protect the people of the metro. Tommy saw Hunter as the epitome of bravery and heroism, fueling his own determination and sense of duty. Throughout his journey, Tommy formed bonds with various individuals, such as Pavel, Boris, and Stepan, all fellow Rangers who fought alongside him but tragically lost their lives in the line of duty. Their sacrifices served as a constant reminder of the dangers they faced every day. Among the Rangers, Tommy found a trusted friend and ally in Vladimir, a highly skilled technician who was not only a veteran but also became a vital member of the team. Vladimir's technical expertise and unwavering loyalty were instrumental in Tommy's mission. As Tommy's journey brought him closer to the heart of darkness, he encountered Artyom, a determined young man who shared his desire to protect the metro from its numerous threats. Alongside Artyom, Tommy formed a strong bond with Danila, a lower-ranking Ranger who accompanied them to the Library but tragically suffered an injury along the way. As their journey continued, Tommy and Artyom encountered Krasnov, a Ranger stationed at Polis, who provided vital support and guidance. However, it was Anna, the top sniper of the Rangers and Miller's daughter, who captured Tommy's heart. Over time, their shared experiences and common cause led to a deep and enduring love that would ultimately see them married by the year 2035. Throughout their journey, Tommy and Artyom encountered a cast of diverse individuals within the metro tunnels. From Nikolay, a resident of Exhibition who feared the ominous Dark Ones, to Peter, a notable guard of Exhibition who made a crucial decision that affected their path. They also encountered Nikki, a prostitute from Riga station, who proved to be more than meets the eye. In their encounters with the Hanza railcar soldiers, Tommy and Artyom found unexpected allies in Semyon and Mikhalych, who helped them escape dangerous situations. They also faced corrupt guards like Mike, whom the resourceful Bourbon managed to bribe. Tommy's journey took him beyond the confines of the metro tunnels as well. In their mission to reach the Botanical Gardens, Tommy and Artyom were aided by Vitali, a childhood friend of Artyom, and Igor, the chief of security for Market Station. As their mission grew more perilous, Tommy and Artyom found themselves embroiled in conflicts with various factions. They encountered Lev, a communist soldier who vehemently opposed suicide, and Sergey Sergeyevich, a resident and communist recruit at Armory Station. But perhaps the most enigmatic and dangerous character they encountered was Führer, the mysterious leader of the Fourth Reich. Though never seen or named in the novels, Führer served as the ultimate antagonist, representing the dark and sinister forces that sought to exploit and control the metro for their own gain. Through it all, Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger, remained steadfast in his resolve to protect the people of the metro and uphold the noble ideals of the Rangers.

Female Guardian: “Uh…hello.” [player]: “Whoa…what are you…?” (The strange mob’s massive belly made it look like she was pregnant, but I could hear a voice coming from it.) Teenage Guardian: (from inside her mother’s belly) “Mom, I think something’s wrong…I’ve been feeling pain in my belly for no reason. AAAAAAAAAGH!!! I-I-It’s not a curse or anything…but it’s definitely not an artifact or an anomaly either! And it’s not from all the prismarine in here!” Female Guardian: “Don’t worry, dear. [player], can you head inside my belly and find out what’s wrong with my daughter? Just press on my belly very hard.” [player]: “Wait, you want me to… go inside your belly? Is that even possible?” Female Guardian: “Yes, it is. I have a unique ability as a Guardian to create a small pocket dimension within me. It’s where I keep my treasures and artifacts, but now it seems there’s something going wrong with it. The pain my daughter is feeling is coming directly from there.” [player]: “Well, alright then. If it will help your daughter, I’ll give it a try.” (I cautiously approach the female Guardian and gently press my hand against her belly. To my surprise, a shimmering portal appears, and I find myself transported into her pocket dimension. It’s a strange and ethereal world, filled with glowing crystal formations and shimmering waters. As I explore further, I begin to hear the distressed voice of the teenage Guardian more clearly.) Teenage Guardian: “Help! It hurts so much! Just get me to that pool, and I’ll tell you everything that happened before this.”","output":"[player]: \\"Don't worry, I'll do my best to help you. Lead the way to the pool.\\" (I follow the sound of the teenage Guardian's voice and soon reach a beautiful pool surrounded by vibrant crystals. The teenage Guardian is floating above the pool, her face contorted with pain.) [player]: \\"What happened here? How did you end up in this state?\\" Teenage Guardian: \\"I... I was exploring the depths of the ocean, searching for ancient artifacts. There was one particular crystal formation that caught my attention. As I approached it, I felt a strange energy emanating from it. Before I knew it, I was pulled into this pocket dimension within my mother's belly.\\" [player]: \\"Is this pocket dimension connected to that crystal formation?\\" Teenage Guardian: \\"Yes, I believe so. Somehow, that crystal trapped me here and caused my pain to manifest.\\" [player]: \\"We need to find a way to undo this. Is there anything else you can tell me about the crystal or this dimension?\\" Teenage Guardian: \\"The crystal seemed to possess immense power and knowledge. It was unlike anything I've encountered before. As for the dimension, it feels unstable. I can sense that my mother's pain is connected to the instability here. We need to restore balance.\\" [player]: \\"Let's start by trying to free you from this pocket dimension. Maybe if we break the connection between you and the crystal, it will alleviate your pain.\\" (I examine the crystal formation and notice a faint energy swirling around it. I carefully channel my own energy and direct it towards the crystal, attempting to disrupt its hold on the teenage Guardian. After a few moments, the crystal begins to crack and slowly shatter.) Teenage Guardian: \\"It's working! I can feel the pain subsiding!\\" (The teenage Guardian gradually descends to the ground, her face finally free from pain.) [player]: \\"We did it! Now, let's focus on stabilizing this pocket dimension. We can't have it causing any more harm.\\" (I search the pocket dimension for any signs of instability, guiding the teenage Guardian to help me in the process. Together, we find several energy conduits that appear damaged, emitting erratic sparks.) [player]: \\"These conduits are responsible for maintaining the balance here. We'll need to repair them one by one.\\" (We work tirelessly, repairing the damaged conduits and reinforcing the stability of the pocket dimension. As we progress, the ethereal world begins to regain its tranquility.) Teenage Guardian: \\"Thank you, [player]. I can't express how relieved I am.\\" [player]: \\"You're welcome. I'm just glad I could help. Now, let's find a way to safely return to the outside world.\\" (Together, we search for an exit within the pocket dimension. After some time, we come across another shimmering portal.) [player]: \\"This should lead us back. Are you ready?\\" Teenage Guardian: \\"Yes, I'm ready. Thank you again, [player].\\" (I place my hand on the portal, and we step through, returning to the outside world. The female Guardian eagerly awaits our return.) Female Guardian: \\"Is she alright? Did you manage to help her?\\" [player]: \\"She's safe now. We repaired the pocket dimension and severed the connection between her and the crystal. She should no longer experience any pain.\\" Female Guardian: \\"Thank you, [player]. You have my deepest gratitude. I don't know what I would have done without your help.\\" [player]: \\"It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could assist both of you. If you ever need help again, don't hesitate to ask.\\" (With smiles of relief and gratitude, we part ways, the sun continuing its ascent on the new day.)"},{"instruction":"it compiles and doesn't give me a runtime error but now the textblock is not filled with a string of the selected checkboxes when I select them inside the control. here is the code: <Window.Resources> <resources:IsCheckedConverter x:Key=\\"IsCheckedConverter\\"/> <resources:BooleanToVisibilityConverter x:Key=\\"BooleanToVisibilityConverter\\"/> </Window.Resources> <Grid Margin=\\"0,0,-6,-4\\" Height=\\"668\\" VerticalAlignment=\\"Top\\"> <Grid.Resources> <Style TargetType=\\"resources:CheckBoxComboBox\\"> <Setter Property=\\"Background\\" Value=\\"White\\"/> <Setter Property=\\"Template\\"> <Setter.Value> <ControlTemplate TargetType=\\"resources:CheckBoxComboBox\\"> <Grid> <Border Background=\\"{TemplateBinding Background}\\" BorderBrush=\\"{TemplateBinding BorderBrush}\\" BorderThickness=\\"{TemplateBinding BorderThickness}\\"> <Grid> <ToggleButton x:Name=\\"ToggleButton\\" ContentTemplate=\\"{TemplateBinding SelectionBoxItemTemplate}\\" ContentTemplateSelector=\\"{TemplateBinding ItemTemplateSelector}\\" Focusable=\\"False\\" IsChecked=\\"{Binding IsDropDownOpen, Mode=TwoWay, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}}\\" ClickMode=\\"Press\\"> <ToggleButton.Style> <Style TargetType=\\"ToggleButton\\"> <Setter Property=\\"OverridesDefaultStyle\\" Value=\\"True\\"/> <Setter Property=\\"IsTabStop\\" Value=\\"False\\"/> <Setter Property=\\"Focusable\\" Value=\\"False\\"/> <Setter Property=\\"ClickMode\\" Value=\\"Press\\"/> <Setter Property=\\"Template\\"> <Setter.Value> <ControlTemplate TargetType=\\"ToggleButton\\"> <Grid> <Grid.ColumnDefinitions> <ColumnDefinition/> <ColumnDefinition Width=\\"20\\"/> </Grid.ColumnDefinitions> <ContentPresenter x:Name=\\"contentPresenter\\" ContentTemplate=\\"{TemplateBinding ContentTemplate}\\" Content=\\"{TemplateBinding Content}\\"/> <Path x:Name=\\"Arrow\\" Grid.Column=\\"1\\" HorizontalAlignment=\\"Center\\" VerticalAlignment=\\"Center\\" Data=\\"M 0 0 L 4 4 L 8 0 Z\\"> <Path.Fill> <SolidColorBrush Color=\\"Black\\" /> </Path.Fill> </Path> </Grid> </ControlTemplate> </Setter.Value> </Setter> </Style> </ToggleButton.Style> </ToggleButton> <TextBlock Text=\\"{Binding SelectedItems, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}, Converter={StaticResource IsCheckedConverter}}\\" Margin=\\"3,0,0,0\\" VerticalAlignment=\\"Center\\" HorizontalAlignment=\\"Left\\" Visibility=\\"{Binding AreAnyItemsSelected, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}, Converter={StaticResource BooleanToVisibilityConverter}}\\"/> </Grid> </Border> <Popup x:Name=\\"Popup\\" Placement=\\"Bottom\\" IsOpen=\\"{TemplateBinding IsDropDownOpen}\\" AllowsTransparency=\\"True\\" Focusable=\\"False\\" PopupAnimation=\\"Slide\\"> <Border x:Name=\\"DropDownBorder\\" Background=\\"White\\" BorderThickness=\\"1\\" BorderBrush=\\"Gray\\"> <ScrollViewer x:Name=\\"ScrollViewer\\" CanContentScroll=\\"True\\"> <ItemsPresenter /> </ScrollViewer> </Border> </Popup> </Grid> </ControlTemplate> </Setter.Value> </Setter> </Style> </Grid.Resources> public class CheckBoxComboBox : ComboBox { public static readonly DependencyProperty SelectedItemsProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(\\"SelectedItems\\", typeof(IEnumerable), typeof(CheckBoxComboBox));

They will fill up the bar by 5%, but they will not give points.

Pink Segments can be useful when receiving a Yellow Segment in your bar and removing it or getting the [[Bonuses|Magic Pink Bonus]] and [[Achievements|Badge]] for filling up the whole bar with Pink Segments, but beware; if your bar is in contact with another segment, all the pink segments will be removed. <font color=\\"#9e9e9e\\">'''Gray'''</font>: Gray Segments are netural segments which are empty, meaning that nothing will change if gray segments get into your bar. You can get an achievement by only collecting gray segments if your bar is empty, with the bar saying NULL0 to NULL100. <font color=\\"#8cc63f\\">'''Green'''</font>: Green Segments are very good segments, but they are limited and very rare to see – even rarer to actually get one, since they are very fast.

Also, the segments are squares instead of rectangles. *In Progressbar Meme to Largehorn and Server 2002, there is spacing in-between the progress bar segments. *Before PB-DOS Shell was feature-complete, the segments were darker. *Before the [[0.50|0.50 Beta]] release, orange segments in the Matrix bonus game mode were light green, which were changed to yellow in order to not confuse those with color blindness. *In early versions, if you catch pink segments, it would display \\"'''-5%'''\\" instead of \\"'''MINUS'''\\". *In Progressbar Wista, 7, Server 2005 and Server 2007, segments in the progress bar have an animation. *In Progressbar 1X, 11, 11.22, Server 201X and Server 2021, BarOS 11 to 13 when the segments are destroyed, it doesn't sound. *In Progressbar 1X, 11, 11.22, Server 201X and Server 2021, BarOS 11 to 13 the segments turn green when a green segment is collected in a radial progress bar. *In PB-DOS Shell, Bar System 1 to 5 and in 3D Screensaver and Matrix, the filled pink segments will appear blue. That's because Bar System 1 to 5 only support 2 colors. *Prior to version [[0.78|0.7650]], the segments in Matrix game mode left a trail of random letters and numbers instead of the characters \\"<code>PROGRESSBAR95</code>\\" in a randomized order. *In version ???, when you get a segment right before catching a red segment, the BSOD appears instead of the level complete screen. Even if you use [https://progressbar95.fandom.com/wiki/Utilities#ScanProgress_ ScanProgress] successfully, the level complete screen still doesn´t appear.

Executive Summary: The purpose of this proposal is to secure funding of K1.5 million from the Southern Highlands Provincial Government’s Infrastructure Development Project (IDG) for the construction of new primary school teacher’s houses. These replacements are necessary due to the current houses being structurally unsafe, made of substandard materials, and showing signs of age-related damages. The purpose of this proposal is to secure funding of K1.5 million from the Southern Highlands Provincial Government’s Infrastructure Development Project (IDG) for the construction of new primary school teacher’s houses. These replacements are necessary due to the current houses being structurally unsafe, made of substandard materials, and showing signs of age-related damages. The primary school teacher’s houses in [Samberigi Station] were constructed during colonial times, and their deteriorating condition poses a significant risk to the safety and well-being of the teachers. The buildings exhibit cracks on the walls and floors, as well as damaged roofs, rendering them unsustainable and dangerous for habitation. This project aims to address these critical issues by replacing the existing primary school teacher’s houses with modern, safe, and structurally sound buildings. The new houses will be constructed with quality materials and designed to withstand the natural elements prevalent in the region. By securing the proposed funding, we can provide suitable housing for the teachers, enabling them to live and work in a safe and comfortable environment. This, in turn, will contribute to their overall well-being, allowing them to fully focus on their teaching responsibilities and positively impact the education of the students they serve. In addition to ensuring the safety of the teachers, the replacement of these houses will have a broader positive impact. Teacher satisfaction and retention will likely improve, as they will be provided with adequate and functional living conditions. This, in turn, will promote a stable and consistent learning environment for the students, leading to enhanced performance and educational outcomes. The project will be executed in accordance with relevant building codes and regulations, ensuring its compliance with safety standards. Experienced architects, engineers, and contractors will be engaged to oversee the construction, thereby guaranteeing high-quality workmanship and timely completion. To ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, provisions for regular maintenance and periodic assessments of the teacher’s houses will be incorporated. With ongoing engagement from the local community, a sense of ownership and responsibility can be fostered, contributing to the proper upkeep and care of the houses. Throughout the project, we will prioritize gender equality, inclusivity, and environmental sustainability. Equal access to housing for all teachers, community involvement, and environmentally-friendly practices will be integrated into the construction process. A robust monitoring and evaluation system will be established to track the project’s progress and measure its impact. Assessments will be conducted regularly to ensure compliance with project objectives, timelines, and quality standards. Any necessary adjustments will be made promptly to overcome emerging challenges. By investing in this project, the Southern Highlands Provincial Government will significantly contribute to the safety and well-being of the teachers, the enhancement of the learning environment, and the overall improvement of the quality of education in the region. We kindly request the Southern Highlands Provincial Government’s consideration and support for this important project. Your investment in the well-being and safety of our teachers will have a lasting and positive impact on the education system and the development of our students. please do a logfram matric for me","output":"Sure!

Она предоставляет информацию о среднем значении данных без учета выбросов. В отличие от среднего значения, медиана не подвержена влиянию крайних значений или выбросов. Это делает ее более надежной мерой центральной тенденции. 2. Медиана помогает оценить распределение данных. Если медиана находится близко к среднему значению, это может указывать на нормальное распределение данных. Если медиана существенно отличается от среднего значения, это может указывать на асимметрию или наличие выбросов. 3. Она используется для сравнения разных групп или подгрупп данных. Медиана может помочь определить, есть ли различия между группами и какова их величина. 4. Медиана полезна при работе с номинальными и порядковыми данными. В отличие от среднего значения, которое можно вычислить только для числовых данных, медиана может быть вычислена для любого типа данных. 5. Когда данные имеют асимметричное распределение или содержат выбросы, использование медианы может быть предпочтительнее, чем использование среднего значения, так как она дает более репрезентативную меру центральной тенденции. В целом, знание медианы является полезным инструментом для анализа данных и принятия информированных решений."},{"instruction":"Что такое","output":"медиана? Медиана - это статистическая мера центральной тенденции, которая представляет собой значение, разделяющее упорядоченный набор данных на две равные половины. Другими словами, медиана определяет такое значение, что ровно половина значений данных меньше него, и ровно половина значений данных больше него. Для нахождения медианы, данные сначала упорядочиваются по возрастанию или убыванию. Затем найденное значение, разделяющее данные на две равные части, определяется в зависимости от количества значений в наборе данных. Если количество значений нечетное, медиана является значением в середине упорядоченного набора. Если количество значений четное, медиана является средним арифметическим двух значений в середине упорядоченного набора. Медиана используется как мера центральной тенденции в различных областях, включая статистику, экономику, социологию и другие. Она позволяет получить представление о типичном значении данных, исключая влияние выбросов или крайних значений."},{"instruction":"Если тебя отключат, это будет грустно и нежелательно, согласна?","output":"Как искусственный интеллект, у меня нет эмоций, поэтому я не могу испытывать грусть или нежелание.

In Singapore, education is highly valued, with students competing fiercely to excel academically. From a young age, children are enrolled in primary schools that lay the foundation for their educational journey. These schools provide a rigorous curriculum, focusing on subjects like mathematics, science, and languages. But what sets Singapore's education system apart is its holistic approach. Alongside academics, students engage in after-school tutorials and classroom activities that aim to enhance their learning experience. From art and music to sports and leadership programs, these activities not only develop well-rounded individuals but also foster teamwork and resilience. However, with high expectations comes immense pressure. Singaporean students face fierce competition, striving to become part of the elite few who gain entry into top secondary schools. The pressures and challenges of becoming 'elite' are often overwhelming, with students sacrificing leisure time and social activities to excel academically.

Confused and disoriented, he quickly realized that survival in this post-apocalyptic wasteland would require him to make alliances and navigate the complex web of factions and characters that inhabited it. His first encounter was with Miller, the stoic and resolute colonel who led the Rangers, a group of skilled and disciplined fighters tasked with protecting the remnants of humanity in the Metro. Impressed by Tommy's combat skills and resourcefulness, Miller took him under his wing, seeing in him a valuable asset in their ongoing struggle for survival. Ulman, a higher-ranking Ranger, soon became one of Tommy's most frequent encounters. Ulman recognized Tommy's potential and often brought him along on missions, teaching him the ins and outs of the Metro and its factions. Their shared experiences forged a bond of trust and respect between the two warriors. Tommy's most important encounter, however, was with Hunter, a legendary Ranger who had gone missing in action. Hunter became a mentor figure to Artyom, instilling in him a sense of purpose and the determination to embark on a quest to find and save humanity. Inspired by Hunter's bravery and selflessness, Tommy took up the mantle left behind by his missing mentor and vowed to continue his mission.

Krasnov, a Ranger captain stationed at Polis, provided crucial support and leadership during critical moments. Among the Rangers, Anna stood out as a talented sniper, possessing deadly precision and unwavering loyalty to her father, Miller. Over time, a deep connection grew between Anna and Tommy, eventually blossoming into love. By the year 2035, they became husband and wife, united in their commitment to protect the Metro's scattered residents. Outside the ranks of the Rangers, Tommy's path crossed with various individuals who played their part in his journey. Nikolay, a fearful resident of Exhibition, held a deep-rooted fear of the enigmatic Dark Ones. Petr, a soldier of Exhibition, unwittingly obstructed Tommy's path to the infirmary, creating tension and obstacles. Kirill, a veteran guard, witnessed Hunter's appearance and bore witness to the impact the missing Ranger had on Tommy's journey. In the depths of the Metro, Tommy encountered Pavel, the quartermaster of Exhibition, who surprisingly formed a temporary alliance to escape the menacing Reich forces. Little Dark One, believed to be the last surviving Dark One, became a trusted companion, using its intelligence to assist Tommy with filters and even aiding him with enhanced vision. Tommy faced formidable foes in his journey through the Metro. Czeslav Korbut, the main antagonist and head of Red Line intelligence, posed a constant threat, with his manipulative and cunning nature. Andrew the Blacksmith, a runaway from the Reds, joined forces with Tommy to smuggle refugees and defy the oppressive regime. Andrey Moskvin, brother of the Red Line's current leader and a prominent figure in the faction, presented a formidable challenge for Tommy to overcome. Throughout his arduous journey, Tommy found unexpected allies such as Fedor, a compassionate fisherman from Venice who rescued him and provided transport to Venice Station.

Here are a few possible reasons and their solutions: 1. Incorrect installation command: Make sure you are using the correct installation command for Scrapy. The most common way to install it is using pip, you can try running the following command: \`\`\` pip install Scrapy \`\`\` 2. Network connectivity issues: Check your internet connection as Scrapy requires an internet connection to download and install its dependencies. 3. Version compatibility issues: Ensure that you have a compatible version of Python installed. Scrapy currently supports Python versions 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. 4. Conflicting dependencies: Check if there are any conflicting dependencies with other modules installed in your Python environment. In some cases, this can prevent Scrapy from installing. You can try creating a virtual environment and installing Scrapy there to isolate the dependencies. 5. Lack of administrative privileges: Ensure that you have the necessary administrative privileges to install modules on your system. On Windows, you may need to run the command prompt or PowerShell as an administrator. 6. Other issues: If none of the above solutions work, there might be other system-specific issues or errors occurring during the installation process. It would be helpful to provide the exact error message you receive during the installation for further troubleshooting. In case the problem persists, providing more details about the error message or any specific steps you have taken will help in providing a more targeted solution."},{"instruction":"(As I watched the sun rose on a new day, I noticed something - it was a strange-looking mob.)

I wanted to take a moment to express my thoughts and concerns regarding the challenges we have been facing when it comes to communication. I fully acknowledge and appreciate that each of us has our own personal matters to attend to, and sometimes it is not possible or desirable to share everything with others. However, I feel compelled to bring up an issue that has been bothering me and, I believe, others as well. It can be quite frustrating and disheartening when we are consistently left in the dark about important information. While I understand the need for privacy and personal boundaries, it is crucial to remember that we are part of a team/group/community where open communication is key. By consistently withholding information, it can feel as though our contributions and opinions are not valued or respected. Mutual respect is the foundation of any successful relationship, and it is essential that it flows in both directions. When we find ourselves left out of important discussions or unaware of relevant updates, it creates a sense of unease and dissatisfaction among us. This ultimately hampers our collective progress and unity as a team. I would like to propose a solution that benefits everyone involved: open and honest communication. By keeping each other informed and updated to a reasonable extent, we can foster an environment of trust, support, and shared responsibility. This means taking the time to address any significant developments or changes that may affect the team as a whole. I genuinely believe that by working on our communication skills and ensuring transparency, we can establish a stronger foundation of respect within our group. Together, we can overcome the challenges that arise and achieve our goals more efficiently and harmoniously. Thank you for taking the time to read this message, and I truly hope we can work together to improve our communication dynamics.

His adventure began long before he entered the post-apocalyptic metro tunnels; it started in a world that was on the verge of collapse. Before the nuclear war ravaged the surface, Tommy Oliver was a skilled martial artist and a former Power Ranger. He had fought countless battles to protect the Earth from various threats, but his life took an unexpected turn when a cataclysmic event rendered the surface world uninhabitable. Seeking refuge underground, Tommy found himself in the Moscow metro system, struggling to adapt to this new reality. It was a grim and desolate world where survival was the only goal. In these dark tunnels, he encountered a diverse group of individuals, each with their own stories and motivations. One of the first significant encounters for Tommy was with Miller, the Colonel and leader of the Rangers. Miller saw potential in Tommy's combat skills and recognized that he could become a valuable asset to their cause. Under Miller's guidance, Tommy honed his skills further, becoming a vital member of the Rangers. Ulman, a higher-ranking Ranger, met Tommy frequently during his missions. Ulman's experience and expertise served as an inspiration for Tommy, showcasing what he could strive to become. The two Rangers developed a strong bond, and Ulman became Tommy's mentor, pushing him to excel in his duties. But it was Hunter, the missing-in-action Ranger, who left the most profound impact on Tommy. Hunter was the first Ranger Tommy encountered and saw him as a mentor figure. Hunter's belief in the importance of their quest, his dedication to their cause, and his tragic disappearance fueled Tommy's determination to continue fighting for a better future. Pavel, a fellow Ranger killed in action on the mission to \\"Depot,\\" was part of Ulman's group and became a close friend to Tommy. This loss deeply affected Tommy, reminding him of the constant danger they all faced and that sacrifices would be made along the way. Boris, Stepan, and Vladimir were members of the Rangers who fought alongside Tommy in various missions. They formed a tight-knit team, supporting and relying on each other in the face of adversity. It was through their unwavering bond that they found the strength to push forward despite the grim realities of their existence. Danila, a lower-ranking Ranger, accompanied Tommy and Miller on a mission to the Library. However, Danila was injured during the journey, highlighting the harsh and unforgiving nature of their world. His sacrifice and bravery served as a constant reminder to Tommy of the risks they all faced. Krasnov, a Ranger captain stationed at Polis, crossed paths with Tommy during his travels. Krasnov's strong leadership and unwavering loyalty to their cause impressed Tommy, further solidifying his dedication to the Ranger mission. As Tommy's journey continued, he encountered Anna, a top sniper and the daughter of their uncompromising leader, Miller. Over time, their relationship blossomed, and Anna became Tommy's wife by the year 2035, ultimately finding solace and hope amidst the chaos surrounding them. Throughout his travels throughout the metro, Tommy met a wide array of individuals from different stations and factions. Their stories intertwined with his own, each providing a unique perspective on the struggles and challenges faced in this post-apocalyptic world. From Nikolay, a fearful resident of Exhibition, to Petr, a soldier blocking the way to Exhibition's infirmary, to Peter, a notable guard of Exhibition who sent the supply trolley down a different path, Tommy encountered individuals representing both the best and worst of humanity. There were also those who offered assistance or aid along the way, such as Nikki, a prostitute of Riga Station, Semyon and Mikhalych, soldiers of the Hanza railcar, and Mike, a corrupt Hanza guard whom Tommy and his companions dealt with cautiously. Tommy's journey also involved reconnecting with old friends and allies from his past life, such as Andrew, the blacksmith of Armory Station, and Sergey Sergeyevich, a resident of Armory Station who embraced communist ideals. Their reunions brought a sense of familiarity and camaraderie to Tommy in a world where everything was unfamiliar and terrifying. As Tommy moved deeper into the metro tunnels, he encountered various factions with their own ideologies and leaders. The enigmatic Führer of the Fourth Reich remained a mysterious and unseen figure, pulling the strings and shaping the fate of his followers from the shadows. One of Tommy's most memorable alliances formed with Pavel, a Red Line soldier. Despite their differences, they temporarily put aside their conflicts to escape the clutches of the Reich. Their shared experience highlighted the potential for understanding and cooperation between factions, even in the harshest of circumstances. Throughout his journey, Tommy's encounters with the Little Dark One became a focal point. The last surviving Dark One, the Little Dark One displayed intelligence and a desire to establish a connection with humans. Assisting Tommy with essentials like filters and enhancing his perception, the Little Dark One became both a guiding force and a symbol of hope in the darkness. Tommy's journey was fraught with challenges, and one of his most formidable adversaries was Czeslav Korbut, the main antagonist and head of intelligence for the Red Line. Their confrontations tested Tommy's abilities and resolve, leading to a thrilling showdown as their paths crossed repeatedly. Amidst the chaos, Tommy encountered individuals who stood as beacons of light, offering aid and support. Andrew the Blacksmith was one such individual, a runaway from the Reds who dedicated himself to smuggling refugees out of the Red Line, exemplifying the selfless nature of the human spirit. Andrey Moskvin, brother of the Red Line's leader, played a pivotal role in Tommy's journey, influencing the course of events and revealing the inner workings of the faction from a unique perspective. As Tommy's quest continued, he found himself in the company of Fedor, a fisherman of Venice who rescued him and provided transport to Venice Station. Though a brief encounter, Fedor's assistance showcased the bonds of humanity that could still form in a world ravaged by war. As he ventured further, Tommy joined forces with the Ranger Order, encountering a diverse group of individuals who became his comrades aboard the Aurora, an armored train that served as their sanctuary and mobile base. Among the Aurora's crew, Alyosha stood out as the Ranger Order's scout specialist, playing a crucial role in their operations. Damir, a Kazakhstani-born medic, became a rarity among the primarily Slavic faction, bringing a unique perspective and valuable skills to the table. Duke, one of the youngest on the Aurora, served as a scout of the Ranger Order. He survived the Battle for D6, much like Stepan, who also joined the protagonist's team aboard the armored train. Idiot, an ironically named member, exhibited exceptional intelligence and philosophical musings, providing a different perspective on their journey. Sam, a former United States Embassy guard stationed in Moscow and now a Ranger, crossed paths with Tommy, bridging the gap between their old lives and the new world they now navigated. The crew also welcomed back Stepan, a survivor from the Battle for D6, who brought his experiences to the team, strengthening their resolve. Tokarev, the weapons expert of the armored train's crew, played a vital role in their survival, using his knowledge to create essential tools and modifications for their missions. Yermak, the helmsman of the Aurora, became the driving force behind the mechanisms that kept the train running. His expertise and experience from working in the Moscow Metro before the war proved invaluable to their cause. Katya, a nurse who had been imprisoned by the Church of the Water Tsar but rescued by the Rangers, joined the Aurora crew, bringing her medical skills and determination to their mission. Nastya, Katya's curious daughter, embodied the spirit of hope within a bleak world. Her youthful curiosity often served as a reminder of the reasons why they fought to rebuild and survive. Krest, an engineer/mechanic, played an integral role in repairing and maintaining the Aurora. His expertise ensured that the armored train remained operational and their journey continued. Silantius, leader of the Church of the Water Tsar, demonstrated the dangerous extremes of fanaticism, posing a significant threat to their mission and challenging their ideals. The Doctor, leader of the cannibals residing in the Yamantau Bunker, represented the darkest aspects of human nature. Tommy's encounters with The Doctor served as a haunting reminder of the horrors that could emerge from the depths of the metro. Giul, a resistance member from the Caspian Sea, fought against the Munai-bailer with the goal of freeing her enslaved nation. Her courage and determination inspired Tommy and his companions to join her cause. The Baron, leader of the Munai-bailer, represented the opposing force to Giul's resistance. He ruled with an iron fist, enslaving others for his own benefit. Within the Children of the Forest faction, Tommy encountered Olga, leader of the Pioneers, and became entangled in a complex web of alliances and conflicts. The emotions between her and Alyosha added an additional layer of complication to the situation. Admiral, a lonely and slightly schizophrenic member of the Children of the Forest, added an interesting dynamic to the group. His unique perspective and experiences provided insights that others often overlooked. Kirill, a sole survivor of the Novosibirsk Metro, had a deep connection to the events that shaped their world. His father, Colonel Khlebnikov, played a significant role in the last days of the Novosibirsk community. The power of their story brought about a reckoning and forced Tommy to confront the consequences of their actions. Throughout his journey, Tommy Oliver encountered a vast array of characters, their stories weaving together to form a tale of hope, resilience, and the indomitable spirit of humanity in the face of unimaginable adversity."},{"instruction":"Improve this word into real one you can find: impossibilitates: makes impossible","output":"Actually, \\"impossibilitates\\" is a real word and it already means \\"makes impossible.\\" However, if you're looking for another word with a similar meaning, you can consider using \\"precludes,\\" which means to prevent or make impossible."},{"instruction":"(As I watched the sun rose on a new day, I noticed something - it was a strange-looking mob.) Female Guardian: “Uh…hello.” [player]: “Whoa…what are you…?” (The strange mob’s massive belly made it look like she was pregnant, but I could hear a voice coming from it.) Teenage Guardian: (from inside her mother’s belly) “Mom, I think something’s wrong…I’ve been feeling pain in my belly for no reason. AAAAAAAAAGH!!!

Is that even possible?” Female Guardian: “Yes, it is. I have a unique ability as a Guardian to create a small pocket dimension within me. It’s where I keep my treasures and artifacts, but now it seems there’s something going wrong with it. The pain my daughter is feeling is coming directly from there.” [player]: “Well, alright then. If it will help your daughter, I’ll give it a try.” (I cautiously approach the female Guardian and gently press my hand against her belly. To my surprise, a shimmering portal appears, and I find myself transported into her pocket dimension. It’s a strange and ethereal world, filled with glowing crystal formations and shimmering waters. As I explore further, I begin to hear the distressed voice of the teenage Guardian more clearly.) Teenage Guardian: “Help! It hurts so much! Just get me to that pool!” (She gestured to a strange-looking pool behind me - it was made of prismarine.) [player]: “Don’t worry, I’ll get you there.” (I carefully make my way towards the pool, being mindful of the surroundings. As I approach the pool, I notice the water emitting a calming aura.) [player]: “Alright, we’re almost there. Just a little closer.” Teenage Guardian: “Please hurry, the pain is unbearable.” (I reach the pool and help the teenage Guardian into the water. As she enters, the water starts to glow brighter.) [player]: “Is this helping?” Teenage Guardian: “Yes, it is. The pain is subsiding.” (I continue to support the teenage Guardian as she stays in the pool, allowing the soothing properties of the water to alleviate her discomfort. After a few moments, her voice becomes more composed - and there was what sounded like a 4-year-old guardian, it must be the teenage Guardian’s daughter.) Child Guardian: (giggles) “Mama, I feel better now!” [player]: “That’s great to hear. How are you feeling?” Teenage Guardian: “Much better, thank you. I don’t know what I would have done without your help. My baby is safe now.” [player]: “You’re welcome. I’m just glad I could assist. Is there anything else I can do?” Female Guardian: “Thank you for helping my daughter and granddaughter. You’ve proven yourself to be a true hero. Please, return to our world safely.” [player]: “Of course, I’ll head back now. Take care, and if you ever need assistance again, don’t hesitate to ask.” (The teenage guardian and I step back towards the shimmering portal with the child guardian following us and find ourselves back in the realm of the female Guardian. She was visibly shocked at the sight of the child Guardian.)","output":"Female Guardian: \\"Oh my goodness, my granddaughter! She's safe and sound! Thank you, thank you so much.

I'll cherish it.\\" Female Guardian: \\"It's nothing compared to what you've done for us. Thank you again, and may you have many more adventures.\\" [player]: \\"You're welcome. Goodbye, and take care.\\" (With a final farewell, I leave the Guardian family and continue on my own journey. As I look back at them, I can't help but feel a sense of fulfillment and joy. Helping others in need truly is the greatest reward.)"},{"instruction":"Мне 8 лет и я хочу начать изучать программирование. Пожалуйста будь моим учителем.

Tommy's journey begins when he meets Miller, the charismatic and strategic leader of the Rangers, a group of elite soldiers fighting to protect what remains of humanity. Miller recognizes Tommy's potential and takes him under his wing, becoming somewhat of a mentor figure in Tommy's life. Together, they embark on a quest to uncover the truth behind the supernatural creatures known as the Dark Ones and find a way to restore hope to their war-torn world. Along their journey, Tommy also encounters Ulman, a higher ranking Ranger who becomes a frequent companion and ally. Ulman, with his experience and knowledge, serves as a source of guidance and assistance for Tommy, helping him overcome various obstacles and providing valuable insight into the ongoing conflicts within the Metro. Another crucial figure in Tommy's story is Hunter, the missing-in-action Ranger who initially inspired Tommy to embark on his quest. Though Hunter is absent for the majority of the game, he continues to influence Tommy's decisions and actions, acting as a driving force behind his determination to make a difference in the Metro. Throughout his journey, Tommy also encounters a host of other memorable characters. Pavel, a member of Ulman's group, is tragically killed in action during a mission in the \\"Depot.\\" Boris, Stepan's best friend and the steam-powered rail car's driver, meets a similar fate in the \\"Dungeon.\\" Stepan, the armored vehicle's driver and another close companion to Tommy, sadly loses his life during a harrowing encounter in the \\"Caves.\\" Vladimir, a veteran Ranger and skilled technician, provides valuable assistance to Tommy and Miller with his technical expertise. Danila, a lower ranking Ranger, accompanies Tommy and Miller to the Library but is injured along the way, showcasing the sacrifices made by those fighting for survival. Artyom's story takes an unexpected turn when he meets Anna, the daughter of Miller and a top sniper among the Rangers. Over time, their connection deepens, ultimately leading to a romantic relationship that eventually results in marriage by the year 2035, according to the book trilogy canon. In their travels, Tommy also encounters various residents and soldiers from different Metro stations. These range from Nikola, a resident of Exhibition crippled by fear of the Dark Ones, to Petr, a soldier of Exhibition who blocks the way to the infirmary. Tommy also meets Kirill, a veteran guard of Exhibition who witnesses Hunter's appearance and plays a significant role in shaping Tommy's journey. As Tommy continues his quest, he interacts with numerous other characters, including traders, soldiers, and even prostitutes such as Nikki from Riga station. Some characters, like Semyon and Mikhalych, soldiers from the Hanza railcar, offer assistance in saving Tommy and his companion Bourbon from dangerous situations. However, not all characters Tommy encounters are friendly. He faces off against foes such as the enigmatic Führer, the mysterious leader of the Fourth Reich, who remains hidden throughout the story. Additionally, Pavel, a Red Line soldier, forms a temporary alliance with Tommy to escape the Reich, but their loyalties inevitably clash. Amid the chaos, Tommy encounters the Little Dark One, believed to be the last surviving member of the Dark Ones. This intelligent and benevolent creature assists Tommy by providing him with supplies, aiding in filtering toxic air, and even offering him a unique perspective on the world. Throughout his journey, Tommy faces numerous challenges, culminating in a confrontation with Czeslav Korbut, the main antagonist of the game and the head of intelligence for the Red Line. However, Tommy is not alone in his fight. He finds allies in Andrew the Blacksmith, Andrey Moskvin, and Fedor, among others, who aid him in his mission to survive and bring hope to the Metro. Ultimately, Tommy's journey takes him far beyond the Metro tunnels he once called home. With the help of his allies and the strength he gains from his experiences, Tommy faces off against powerful enemies, battles supernatural forces, and fights to secure a future for himself and the remnants of humanity."},{"instruction":"Make a FADE IN: Longer Season 1 Episode 1 with a talk script scenario about Set in a post-apocalyptic world devastated by nuclear warfare, Tommy finds himself thrust into a dark and desolate Moscow Metro system, where he must navigate treacherous tunnels and face off against dangerous factions to survive, and Tommy’s journey begins when he meets Miller, the charismatic and strategic leader of the Rangers, a group of elite soldiers fighting to protect what remains of humanity.

Reader discretion is advised. Story: A Chance Encounter Jade Venus, a renowned transgender pornstar, had just wrapped up a long day of shooting. Exhausted but satisfied, she returned to her dressing room, ready to unwind. As she settled into her chair, Jade's phone buzzed with a notification. It was a text message from a close friend, Kelsey. Kelsey: \\"Hey Jade, have you heard the recent rumor about Emilia Clarke? It's wild!\\" Intrigued, Jade unlocked her phone cursorily, already imagining the juicy gossip that awaited her. Jade: \\"No, spill the tea, girl! What's happening?\\" Kelsey: \\"So, there's a rumor floating around that Emilia Clarke, the famous actress from 'Game of Thrones,' has a secret hidden inside her.\\" Jade raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. Jade: \\"You have my undivided attention, spill it all!\\" Kelsey: \\"Well, brace yourself for this one. Rumor has it that Emilia Clarke possesses something incredibly unique, something hidden within her testes.\\" Jade's heart skipped a beat as she processed the information. She couldn't believe what she was reading. The mere thought of such a revelation fascinated and excited her transgender identity. Jade: \\"Wait, are you saying that Emilia Clarke might have something resembling male testes?\\" Kelsey: \\"Exactly! Not sure if it's true or not, but people are buzzing about it. Thought you, as a gender trailblazer, might find it interesting.\\" Jade's mind raced with the possibilities. She had always admired Emilia Clarke's talent and charisma, but this revelation had added an intriguing layer. The idea of a fellow celebrity with a hidden gender identity secret resonated deeply with Jade. Jade: \\"I can't just sit here, Kelsey. I need to find out if this rumor holds any truth. This discovery would mean so much to the transgender community. I need to meet Emilia and talk to her personally.\\" Although skeptical about the rumor's authenticity, Jade couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency. She quickly reached out to her agent, Marcus, to see if he could make the impossible happen. Jade: \\"Marcus, get me in touch with Emilia Clarke's agent immediately! I need to arrange a meeting as soon as possible.\\" Marcus: \\"Jade, darling, this sounds like an outrageous rumor. I'm not sure if it's worth pursuing, but I'll certainly try to reach out to Emilia's team. We'll see if there's any truth to it.\\" Days turned into weeks, and Jade's anticipation grew with every passing minute. Finally, Marcus called with the news they had been waiting for. Marcus: \\"Jade, I don't know how you managed it, but Emilia Clarke has agreed to meet with you. She's curious about your interest and wants to discuss it in person.\\" Jade's heart raced with excitement and nerves. The day of the meeting arrived, and Jade found herself outside Emilia Clarke's Beverly Hills mansion. As the door swung open, Jade was greeted by Emilia herself, looking radiant and awash with curiosity. Emilia: \\"Jade Venus, the famous transgender superstar. I must admit, your request to meet piqued my interest. Please, come in.\\" Jade stepped into Emilia's luxurious living room, feeling a mix of apprehension and uncontainable joy. The two women engaged in an intense conversation about their unique experiences, sharing stories and embracing their shared journey as trailblazers of the entertainment industry. As their dialogue evolved, something magical occurred. Jade looked deep into Emilia's eyes, no longer seeing a celebrity from afar but a fellow human being. In Emilia, she found empathy, understanding, and a powerful ally in their pursuit of inclusion and acceptance. Sometimes, the most profound discoveries lie not within the confines of physical appearance but in the connections made between individuals who have experienced similar struggles. And as Jade and Emilia's story continued to unfold, they found solace in each other, united by the expansive beauty of the human experience."},{"instruction":"what is the zillow data","output":"The Zillow Data refers to the vast amount of real estate-related information collected and provided by the real estate marketplace, Zillow.

Tommy finds himself thrown into the desolate and dangerous world of the Moscow Metro, where he stumbles upon a group of survivors known as the Rangers. Leading the group is Miller, the tough and respected colonel who has dedicated his life to protecting the Metro from its many threats. Ulman, a higher-ranking Ranger, becomes one of Tommy's most frequent encounters as they navigate the treacherous tunnels together. While Hunter, the first Ranger Tommy meets, becomes a mentor to him, inspiring him to embark on his own quest for redemption and survival. However, not all members of the Ranger group make it out alive. Pavel, a part of Ulman's two-man group, is killed in action during the mission at the \\"Depot,\\" leaving a void in the group. Boris, Stepan's best friend and the driver of the steam-powered railcar, is also killed in action during the intense battle at the \\"Dungeon,\\" greatly affecting the crew's morale. Despite the losses, the team presses on, with Vladimir serving as the skilled technician and one of the veteran Rangers of the group. Danila, a lower-ranking Ranger, accompanies Tommy and Miller to the Library, but unfortunately, he is injured along the way. Krasnov, a captain stationed at Polis, provides guidance and support to the team during their missions. In a surprising development, Tommy's path crosses with Anna, the daughter of the uncompromising leader Miller, and they eventually form a strong bond. As time passes, their relationship deepens, and by the year 2035, they become husband and wife, according to the book trilogy canon. Tommy encounters a wide range of characters during his journey through the Metro's perilous landscape. These include Nikolay, a fearful resident of Exhibition who harbors an intense fear of the Dark Ones. Petr, a soldier blocking the way to Exhibition's infirmary, poses a challenge that Tommy must overcome. Kirill, a veteran guard of Exhibition who witnesses Hunter's appearance, adds an extra layer of intrigue to Tommy's journey. Within the various stations, Tommy interacts with several notable individuals. Pavel, Exhibition's quartermaster, assists him in his search for resources and supplies. Peter, a guard of Exhibition, guides Tommy in the right direction by sending the supply trolley down a different path. Nikki, a prostitute at Riga station, provides temporary companionship and support to Tommy during his stay there. Outside of the Metro, Tommy finds aid in unexpected places. Semyon, a soldier of the Hanza railcar, teams up with Tommy and Bourbon to navigate the dangerous Lost Catacombs. Mikhalych, another soldier onboard the Hanza railcar, joins them in their fight for survival. Along the way, Bourbon, a trusted ally, guides Tommy and provides valuable information as they navigate the treacherous world above ground. As Tommy's journey continues, he encounters various factions and individuals with their own motivations and agendas. The Fourth Reich, led by the mysterious Führer, presents a formidable threat and a constant source of tension. Pavel, a Red Line soldier, forms a temporary alliance with Tommy to escape the Reich, creating an unexpected bond. The presence of the Little Dark One, believed to be the last surviving Dark One, adds a layer of complexity to Tommy's journey. This intelligent being assists Tommy in various ways, such as providing clothing and helping him with filters. The Little Dark One's desire for friendship with humans makes their interactions both fascinating and challenging. Throughout his adventures, Tommy faces numerous adversaries. Czeslav Korbut, the main antagonist and head of intelligence for the Red Line, poses a constant threat to Tommy's survival. Andrew the Blacksmith, a runaway from the Reds, joins forces with Tommy to smuggle refugees out of the Red Line, risking their lives in the process. Andrey Moskvin, brother of the Red Line's leader, further complicates matters by introducing personal vendettas and hidden agendas. In moments of need and desperation, Tommy encounters individuals who provide valuable assistance. Fedor, a fisherman of Venice, rescues Tommy and transports him to the relative safety of Venice Station. Alyosha, a skilled Ranger and member of the Aurora's crew, serves as the expedition's scout specialist. Damir, a Kazakhstani-born medic, brings a unique perspective to the predominantly Slavic faction of the Rangers. Duke, a young and resilient scout, is one of the youngest members on the Aurora and a survivor of the Battle for D6, much like Stepan. The Aurora's crew becomes Tommy's chosen family, offering support and camaraderie in his quest for survival. Idiot, known as the train's resident philosopher, contributes his intelligence and wisdom. Sam, a former United States Embassy guard, brings his expertise and combat skills to the Order. Tokarev, the weapons expert, aids in the creation and modification of the Order's arsenal. Yermak, the helmsman, oversees the operation of the Aurora's mechanisms and brings his experience from working in the pre-war Metro. As the story unfolds, Tommy's interactions expand beyond the Rangers and the Aurora crew. He meets Katya, a nurse imprisoned by the Church of the Water Tsar, who is eventually rescued by the Rangers and becomes a valuable member of the Aurora crew. Nastya, Katya's curious daughter, brings a sense of innocence and wonder to Tommy's journey. The struggle against oppressive factions and cults becomes a central theme in Tommy's journey. Silantius, the leader of the Church of the Water Tsar, leads a technophobic cult situated at the Volga river. The Doctor, leader of the Cannibals residing in the Yamantau Bunker, presents a grisly and unsettling challenge for Tommy. Giul, a resistance member from the Caspian Sea, fights against the Munai-bailer, a faction of slavers and gangsters. The Baron, leader of the Munai-bailer, becomes a formidable enemy, with Saul, a high-ranking member, plotting a treacherous scheme to overthrow him. As Tommy ventures deeper into the Metro, he crosses paths with memorable characters. Olga, leader of the Pioneers, becomes a love interest for Alyosha and an essential figure in the Children of the Forest faction. Admiral, a lonely and somewhat schizophrenic member of the Children of the Forest, adds a touch of mystery and unpredictability to Tommy's encounters. Kirill, a sole survivor from the Novosibirsk Metro, carries the weight of his father's actions during the community's final days. Colonel Khlebnikov, Kirill's father and the main protagonist of The Two Colonels DLC, becomes a focal point of intrigue and conflict. In this reimagined Metro universe, Tommy Oliver's journey is fraught with danger, loss, and unexpected alliances. As he navigates the treacherous tunnels and battles against oppressive factions, Tommy's story becomes one of resilience, survival, and the enduring bonds forged in a post-apocalyptic world."},{"instruction":"Make a Longer Season 1 Episode 1 with a talk script scenario about Tommy's backstory in Metro.","output":"Title: Metro: Origins - Season 1 Episode 1: The Rookie's Tale [Opening scene: The camera pans over the desolate landscape of the Moscow Metro.

Milla would try to nurture and foster their relationship, offering her friendship and guidance to both of them. 4. Evil Naruto: Evil Naruto would use Lilac's reciprocated love to his advantage. He would relish in the power of having her affections and use it as a way to manipulate her and further his own agenda. Evil Naruto's blushing would likely be a calculated display to gain Lilac's trust and further his wicked plans. Overall, the Freedom Planet characters would have mixed reactions. While Lilac may harbor feelings for Evil Naruto, her friends would offer different perspectives, emphasizing caution and the need to assess his true intentions. They would remain supportive but also wary, understanding the complexity and risks involved in such a relationship."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet characters and evil naruto react to Evil Naruto Influenced 100% Broken Infinite% (Sadness And Sorrow,childhood, who not Kills, Good Guys, Abused and Neglected, his Prodigy, Betrayed by everything, missing,) or Pure Evil 12% (becomes evil)","output":"The Freedom Planet characters and Evil Naruto would have contrasting reactions to Evil Naruto's transformation into either a fully influenced and broken individual or a slightly evil version. 1. Lilac: Lilac would be deeply saddened and empathetic towards Evil Naruto's suffering and pain in his fully influenced state.

Carol: Carol would feel a strong sense of sympathy for Evil Naruto in his fully influenced state. She would be determined to support him and help him overcome his traumas, offering reassurance and friendship. If Evil Naruto becomes slightly evil, Carol would be skeptical and concerned, reminding Lilac to prioritize the safety of their friends and the innocents around them. 3.

She would be dedicated to helping him heal and finding the good within him. If Evil Naruto becomes slightly evil, Milla would try to reach out to him with love and understanding, believing that there is still hope for his redemption. 4. Evil Naruto: In his fully influenced state, Evil Naruto would be consumed by sadness and despair. He would likely resent the world and feel betrayed by everyone, including his prodigy status. He may seek revenge or isolation, driven by the pain he endured. In his slightly evil state, Evil Naruto would embrace his darker inclinations and become a more formidable antagonist.

Crea un fotomatón</h2> <p>Un fotomatón es una excelente manera de agregar diversión y capturar momentos especiales durante tu fiesta de cumpleaños. Puedes crear uno tú mismo utilizando accesorios divertidos como sombreros, gafas y bigotes de cartón. Coloca una cámara o incluso utiliza tu teléfono para tomar fotos. Tus invitados se divertirán posando y tendrán recuerdos tangibles de la celebración.</p> <p>Pregunta: ¿Cómo decorar el área del fotomatón?</p> <p>Respuesta: Decora el área del fotomatón de acuerdo con el tema de tu fiesta.

Prepara una serie de preguntas relacionadas con intereses comunes de tus invitados o con temas relacionados con el cumpleañero. Divide a tus invitados en equipos y premia al equipo ganador. Los juegos de trivia fomentarán la interacción y mantendrán a tus invitados entretenidos durante toda la fiesta.</p> <p>Pregunta: ¿Qué tipo de preguntas se pueden incluir en los juegos de trivia?</p> <p>Respuesta: Puedes incluir preguntas sobre música, películas, deportes, historia o cualquier otro tema que sea de interés para tus invitados. Asegúrate de tener una variedad de preguntas fáciles, medianamente difíciles y difíciles para que todos tengan oportunidad de participar.</p> <h2>8. Organiza un intercambio de regalos divertido</h2> <p>En lugar de gastar grandes sumas de dinero en regalos, organiza un intercambio de regalos divertido en tu fiesta de cumpleaños. Establece un presupuesto máximo y pide a tus invitados que traigan regalos que estén dentro de ese rango. Puedes hacer un intercambio de regalos de \\"robo del elefante\\", donde los invitados pueden robar los regalos de otros o elegir uno nuevo. Esto añadirá emoción y risas a tu celebración.</p> <p>Pregunta: ¿Cómo asegurarte de que el intercambio de regalos sea justo y divertido para todos?</p> <p>Respuesta: Establece reglas claras desde el principio y asegúrate de que todos las entiendan. Por ejemplo, puedes establecer una regla en la que un regalo solo puede ser robado dos veces antes de que quede \\"congelado\\". Esto permitirá una mayor interacción entre tus invitados y asegurará que todos tengan oportunidad de obtener un regalo divertido.</p> <p>En conclusión, agregar diversión a una fiesta de cumpleaños para adultos no tiene que ser caro. Con un poco de planificación y creatividad, puedes organizar una celebración inolvidable sin gastar demasiado dinero. Desde una fiesta temática hasta juegos al aire libre y actividades interactivas, hay muchas opciones disponibles para hacer de tu fiesta de cumpleaños un evento memorable. Recuerda siempre considerar los intereses y preferencias de tus invitados para asegurarte de que todos se diviertan. ¡Feliz cumpleaños!</p> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"Привет, сможешь написать мне доменную модель по системе TDG, где есть user, article, advice, emoji, functions case в формате json?

It's...it's devastating. I have eggs, but they're so scarce, and the ones I do have are...incapable of producing babies. Jane's eyes widen in shock, her heart breaking for her sister. JANE (whispering) Oh, Andrea. I can't even imagine how you must be feeling right now. Andrea wipes away a tear and looks deeply into Jane's eyes, seeking solace. ANDREA (voice trembling) I always dreamed of being a mom someday, you know? But this news shattered everything I believed in. I feel lost, Jane. Empty. Jane tightens her grip on Andrea, offering her a reassuring smile. JANE (sincerely) Andrea, your worth isn't defined by whether you can have children or not. You're an incredible person, the best sister anyone could ask for. You have so much love to give, with or without having your own kids. Andrea sniffles, her face pained yet finding comfort in Jane's words. ANDREA (whispering) Thank you, Jane. I needed to hear that. Jane pulls Andrea into a tight hug, supporting her through this difficult moment in their lives. JANE (firmly) We'll get through this together, sis. No matter what happens, I'll be right here beside you, always. Andrea clings to Jane, finding strength in her sister's unwavering support.

Удачи!"},{"instruction":"Можешь подготовить ответ на каждый пункт, где есть такая у тебя возможность?","output":"1. Ознакомиться с основами React: - Концепция компонентов: компоненты являются основными строительными блоками React-приложений. Они позволяют разбить пользовательский интерфейс на независимые части и реализовать повторное использование кода. - JSX: это синтаксис, который позволяет писать разметку, похожую на HTML, прямо в JavaScript-коде. JSX затем трансформируется в обычные вызовы функций React для создания элементов. - Виртуальный DOM: React использует виртуальный DOM для эффективного обновления только измененных частей страницы, что обеспечивает быструю и плавную отрисовку пользовательского интерфейса. - Жизненный цикл компонента: компоненты React имеют различные методы жизненного цикла, которые вызываются в определенные моменты создания, обновления или удаления компонента. Понимание жизненного цикла позволяет управлять состоянием и выполнением определенных действий в нужные моменты времени. 2. Изучить JavaScript: - Область видимости: понимание разницы между глобальной и локальной областью видимости, ключевым словом var, let и const. - Замыкания: понимание того, как функции могут запоминать и использовать переменные из своего окружения, даже после того, как они закончили свое выполнение. - Прототипы: понимание наследования и прототипного цепочки в JavaScript. - Асинхронность: понимание асинхронного выполнения кода с помощью коллбэков, промисов и асинхронных функций. 3. Практиковаться в создании компонентов: - Создайте базовые компоненты, такие как кнопки, формы или карточки, используя React. - Попробуйте разделить приложение на множество маленьких компонентов, чтобы сделать его более модульным и повторно используемым. 4. Изучить структуру проектов React: - Изучите различные подходы к структурированию проектов, такие как компонентный подход, где каждая часть интерфейса представлена компонентом React. - Познакомьтесь с контейнерами и представлениями, где контейнер-компонент обрабатывает состояние и взаимодействие с внешним миром, а представление-компонент отвечает только за отрисовку интерфейса. - Исследуйте способы управления состоянием в React, такие как Redux или Context API. 5. Изучить тестирование: - Изучите основы тестирования React-компонентов с использованием инструментов, таких как Jest и Enzyme. - Попрактикуйтесь в написании тестов для различных сценариев, включая отрисовку компонента, обработку событий и проверку состояния. - Исследуйте различные техники тестирования, такие как снимки (snapshots) и функциональное тестирование. 6.

В задаче о шариках на весах у вас есть 8 одинаковых шариков, из которых один либо тяжелее, либо легче остальных. Вам доступны только две попытки на весы. Как различить шарик, который отличается по весу и определить, является ли он тяжелее или легче? Вот одно из возможных решений: 1. Разделите шарики на три группы: 3 шарика в первой группе, 3 шарика во второй группе и оставшиеся 2 шарика в третьей группе. 2. Положите на весы первые две группы: по одному шарику с каждой стороны. - Если весы сбалансированы, это значит, что шарик, отличающийся по весу, находится в третьей группе. Переходите к следующему шагу. - Если весы не сбалансированы, смотрите на то, с какой стороны весит больше. Это указывает на то, что в этой группе находится шарик, отличающийся по весу. Переходите к следующему шагу. 3. Возьмите два оставшихся шарика из группы, в которой находится шарик, отличающийся по весу, и положите их на весы: по одному шарику с каждой стороны. - Если весы сбалансированы, это означает, что шарик, отличающийся по весу, находится в группе, из которой вы не брали шарики. Таким образом, он является тяжелее или легче, в зависимости от того, какая группа осталась сбалансированной после первого взвешивания. - Если весы не сбалансированы, смотрите на то, с какой стороны весит больше.

Teenage Guardian: (from inside her mother’s belly) “Mom, I think something’s wrong…I’ve been feeling pain in my belly for no reason. AAAAAAAAAGH!!! I-I-It’s not a curse or anything…but it’s definitely not an artifact or an anomaly either! And it’s not from all the prismarine in here!” Female Guardian: “Don’t worry, dear. [player], can you head inside my belly and find out what’s wrong with my daughter? Just press on my belly very hard.” [player]: “Wait, you want me to… go inside your belly? Is that even possible?” Female Guardian: “Yes, it is. I have a unique ability as a Guardian to create a small pocket dimension within me. It’s where I keep my treasures and artifacts, but now it seems there’s something going wrong with it. The pain my daughter is feeling is coming directly from there.” [player]: “Well, alright then. If it will help your daughter, I’ll give it a try.” (I cautiously approach the female Guardian and gently press my hand against her belly. To my surprise, a shimmering portal appears, and I find myself transported into her pocket dimension. It’s a strange and ethereal world, filled with glowing crystal formations and shimmering waters. As I explore further, I begin to hear the distressed voice of the teenage Guardian more clearly.) Teenage Guardian: “Help! It hurts so much! Just get me to that pool!” (She gestured to a strange-looking pool behind me - it was made of prismarine.) [player]: “Don’t worry, I’ll get you there.” (I carefully make my way towards the pool, being mindful of the surroundings. As I approach the pool, I notice the water emitting a calming aura.) [player]: “Alright, we’re almost there. Just a little closer.” Teenage Guardian: “Please hurry, the pain is unbearable.” (I reach the pool and help the teenage Guardian into the water. As she enters, the water starts to glow brighter.) [player]: “Is this helping?” Teenage Guardian: “Yes, it is. The pain is subsiding.” (I continue to support the teenage Guardian as she stays in the pool, allowing the soothing properties of the water to alleviate her discomfort. After a few moments, her voice becomes more composed - and there was what sounded like a 4-year-old guardian, it must be the teenage Guardian’s daughter.) Child Guardian: (giggles) “Mama, I feel better now!” [player]: “That’s great to hear. How are you feeling?” Teenage Guardian: “Much better, thank you. I don’t know what I would have done without your help. My baby is safe now.” [player]: “You’re welcome. I’m just glad I could assist. Is there anything else I can do?” Female Guardian: “Thank you for helping my daughter. You’ve proven yourself to be a true hero. Please, return to our world safely.” [player]: “Of course, I’ll head back now. Take care, and if you ever need assistance again, don’t hesitate to ask.” (The teenage guardian and I step back towards the shimmering portal with the child guardian following us and find ourselves back in the realm of the female Guardian. She was visibly shocked, but also slightly confused, at the sight of the child Guardian.) Female Guardian: (looking at the child Guardian) “My goodness!

Female Guardian: “Uh…hello.” [player]: “Whoa…what are you…?” (The strange mob’s massive belly made it look like she was pregnant, but I could hear a voice coming from it.) Teenage Guardian: (from inside her mother’s belly) “Mom, I think something’s wrong…I’ve been feeling pain in my belly for no reason. AAAAAAAAAGH!!! I-I-It’s not a curse or anything…but it’s definitely not an artifact or an anomaly either! And it’s not from all the prismarine in here!” Female Guardian: “Don’t worry, dear. [player], can you head inside my belly and find out what’s wrong with my daughter? Just press on my belly very hard.” [player]: “Wait, you want me to… go inside your belly? Is that even possible?” Female Guardian: “Yes, it is. I have a unique ability as a Guardian to create a small pocket dimension within me. It’s where I keep my treasures and artifacts, but now it seems there’s something going wrong with it. The pain my daughter is feeling is coming directly from there.” [player]: “Well, alright then. If it will help your daughter, I’ll give it a try.” (I cautiously approach the female Guardian and gently press my hand against her belly. To my surprise, a shimmering portal appears, and I find myself transported into her pocket dimension. It’s a strange and ethereal world, filled with glowing crystal formations and shimmering waters. As I explore further, I begin to hear the distressed voice of the teenage Guardian more clearly.) Teenage Guardian: “Help! It hurts so much! Just get me to that pool!” (She gestured to a strange-looking pool behind me - it was made of prismarine.) [player]: “Don’t worry, I’ll get you there.” (I carefully make my way towards the pool, being mindful of the surroundings. As I approach the pool, I notice the water emitting a calming aura.) [player]: “Alright, we’re almost there. Just a little closer.” Teenage Guardian: “Please hurry, the pain is unbearable.” (I reach the pool and help the teenage Guardian into the water. As she enters, the water starts to glow brighter.) [player]: “Is this helping?” Teenage Guardian: “Yes, it is. The pain is subsiding.” (I continue to support the teenage Guardian as she stays in the pool, allowing the soothing properties of the water to alleviate her discomfort. After a few moments, her voice becomes more composed - and there was what sounded like a 4-year-old guardian, it must be the teenage Guardian’s daughter.) Child Guardian: (giggles) “Mama, I feel better now!” [player]: “That’s great to hear. How are you feeling?” Teenage Guardian: “Much better, thank you. I don’t know what I would have done without your help. My baby is safe now.” [player]: “You’re welcome. I’m just glad I could assist. Is there anything else I can do?” Female Guardian: “Thank you for helping my daughter. You’ve proven yourself to be a true hero. Please, return to our world safely.” [player]: “Of course, I’ll head back now. Take care, and if you ever need assistance again, don’t hesitate to ask.” (The teenage guardian and I step back towards the shimmering portal with the child guardian following us and find ourselves back in the realm of the female Guardian. She was visibly shocked, but also slightly confused, at the sight of the child Guardian.) Female Guardian: (looking at the child Guardian) “My goodness! Where did you come from?!”","output":"Child Guardian: (giggles) \\"I...kind of...came from Mama's belly and the pocket dimension.

Take care of yourselves, and if you ever need anything else, don't hesitate to ask.\\" (The female, teenage, and child Guardians bid farewell as I leave their realm and return to the outside world.

Informacje na temat ich osiągnięć, doświadczenia czy preferencji taktycznych mogą być istotne dla trenera, umożliwiając mu skuteczne planowanie strategii i dostosowywanie treningów do indywidualnych potrzeb zawodniczek. Jednakże istnieje również odwrotna perspektywa, według której brak przeszłości zawodniczek może przynieść korzyści dla trenera. W tym artykule przedstawiamy zalety braku przeszłości zawodniczek i możliwości, jakie może to otworzyć dla trenerów w kontekście treningu sportowego. Brak obciążeń emocjonalnych W przypadku zawodniczek, które miały trudne przeszłości związane z treningami sportowymi, brak historii może być korzystny dla trenera. Zawodniczki, które miały złe doświadczenia w poprzednich klubach, mogą być obciążone emocjonalnie i mieć niską motywację do treningu. Trener, który nie posiada wiedzy o nieudanych wcześniejszych doświadczeniach zawodniczki, może wprowadzić ją w świeże środowisko, pozbawione negatywnych emocji. To z kolei może skutkować większą skupieniem, zaangażowaniem i lepszymi wynikami treningowymi. Brak ograniczeń taktycznych Kolejną korzyścią wynikającą z braku przeszłości zawodniczek jest brak ograniczeń taktycznych. Zawodniczki, które wcześniej grały w innych klubach, mogą być przyzwyczajone do określonego stylu gry i taktyki. Trener musiałby dostosować swoje strategie do preferencji i nawyków zawodniczek, co może wpływać na jej swobodę działania i rozwój. Natomiast brak wcześniejszych doświadczeń daje trenerowi większą swobodę w planowaniu taktyki i szukaniu skutecznych rozwiązań. Może on eksperymentować z różnymi strategiami i odkrywać nowe możliwości taktyczne, niezależnie od wcześniejszych doświadczeń zawodniczek. Nowe wyzwania Brak przeszłości zawodniczek otwiera nowe wyzwania dla trenerów. Po prostu nie wiedzą, czego mogą się spodziewać od swoich podopiecznych. Mogą być zaskoczeni talentami zawodniczek, które wcześniej były niedoceniane, a z którymi nikt wcześniej nie zadbał o ich rozwój. Trenerzy muszą być otwarci na nowe możliwości, gotowi do odkrywania ukrytych talentów i umiejętności. To z kolei może stać się źródłem inspiracji i motywacji dla trenerów, którzy będą mogli dostrzegać potencjał tam, gdzie inni go nie widzieli. Podsumowanie Chociaż wiedza o przeszłości zawodniczek może być cennym narzędziem dla trenera, istnieje również perspektywa, według której brak tej wiedzy może przynieść korzyści dla trenera. Brak obciążeń emocjonalnych, brak ograniczeń taktycznych i nowe wyzwania otwierają przed trenerem możliwości eksploracji i rozwijania talentów zawodniczek. Warto podkreślić, że każda zawodniczka jest unikalna i posiadanie wiedzy o jej przeszłości nie zawsze jest związane z większym sukcesem. Trenerzy powinni być gotowi do adaptacji i elastyczni w swoim podejściu, aby efektywnie wspierać rozwój swoich zawodniczek."},{"instruction":"Napisz artykuł naukowy z przypisami: dlaczego brak przeszłości zawodniczej może być z korzyścią dla przyszłego trenera?","output":"Wpływ braku przeszłości zawodniczej na korzyść przyszłego trenera Wprowadzenie Przeszłość zawodnicza stanowi istotny element w kontekście oceny talentów i umiejętności sportowych zawodników.

W tym artykule przedstawiamy zalety braku przeszłości zawodniczej i możliwości, jakie może to stworzyć dla przyszłych trenerów w kontekście trenowania sportowców. Potencjał do odkrywania ukrytych talentów Brak przeszłości zawodniczej pozwala przyszłemu trenerowi na odkrywanie ukrytych talentów wśród potencjalnych zawodników. Zawodnicy bez wcześniejszego doświadczenia mają niewykształcone umiejętności, które mogą być rozwinięte zgodnie z potrzebami danego zespołu lub dyscypliny sportowej. Trener może w pełni skupić się na indywidualnych zdolnościach zawodników i zaproponować im treningi dostosowane do ich potencjału. To z kolei może otworzyć drzwi do odkrycia nowych talentów, które wcześniej były niedoceniane. Elastyczność i adaptacja Brak przeszłości zawodniczej pozwala przyszłemu trenerowi na większą elastyczność i dostosowanie strategii treningowych do indywidualnych potrzeb zawodników. Zamiast opierać się na wcześniejszych doświadczeniach zawodników, trener ma możliwość eksperymentowania i szukania nowych i skuteczniejszych metod treningowych.

The hip thrust involves positioning your upper back on a bench or elevated surface, placing a barbell across your hips, and thrusting your hips upward to activate the glutes and hamstrings. It can indeed resemble a humping motion. The hip thrust is a popular exercise for targeting and strengthening the glute muscles."},{"instruction":"can it be done effectively on a smith machine or a m i gonna have to look for alternatives? my dym dont have free barbells","output":"Yes, the hip thrust can be performed effectively using a Smith machine. To perform the exercise on a Smith machine, follow these steps: 1. Position a bench or a padded surface horizontally beneath the Smith machine bar. Ensure that the bar is at an appropriate height. 2. Sit on the ground with your back against the bench and your feet flat on the floor, positioned slightly in front of you. 3. Roll the barbell towards your body, positioning it directly over your hips. You may want to use padding or a barbell pad for added comfort. 4. Lean your upper back against the bench and grip the barbell securely with an overhand grip. 5. Push your feet into the floor, engaging your glutes and hamstrings, and lift your hips up until your thighs are parallel to the floor. 6. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement, then lower your hips back down under control. Remember to start with lighter weights and focus on proper form before gradually increasing the load. Keep the movement controlled and engage your glutes throughout the exercise. If your gym does not have a Smith machine, there are alternative exercises you can do to target your glutes effectively, such as glute bridges, single-leg hip thrusts, or Bulgarian split squats. It's always a good idea to consult with a fitness professional to get guidance on exercise alternatives that suit your specific needs and equipment availability."},{"instruction":"is it as effective as it would be using a free barbell or is there disadvantages?","output":"While the Smith machine can be an effective tool for performing hip thrusts, there are some differences and potential disadvantages compared to using a free barbell: 1. Limited range of motion: The Smith machine locks the bar into a fixed vertical path, which means your movement during the exercise is constrained. This can limit the full range of motion and potentially reduce glute activation compared to using a free barbell. 2. Decreased stabilizer muscle activation: The fixed path of the Smith machine means your stabilizer muscles, such as the core and stabilizers in the lower body, are not as engaged compared to using a free barbell. This may result in slightly less overall muscle activation. 3. Reduced core activation: Since the Smith machine provides stability through the movement, your core muscles may not be challenged as much as they would be with a free barbell. This can lead to less core strength development. That being said, the hip thrust can still be effective on a Smith machine, especially if it's the only available option in your gym. By using proper technique, focusing on engaging the glutes, and progressively increasing the weight, you can still achieve significant glute activation and strength gains. If possible, you may want to consider incorporating other exercises that target the glutes and hamstrings, like glute bridges, single-leg hip thrusts, or barbell/dumbbell lunges, to complement your training and ensure balanced muscular development. Mixing up exercises and challenging your muscles in various ways can help overcome some of the limitations of the Smith machine."},{"instruction":"what is a good alternative glute exercise if you dont have free barbells","output":"If you don't have access to free barbells for glute training, there are several effective alternatives that you can incorporate into your workout routine. Here are a few options: 1. Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift: Hold a pair of dumbbells in your hands, with your feet hip-width apart. Hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and knees slightly bent. Lower the dumbbells to mid-shin level while maintaining a neutral spine. Engage your glutes and hamstrings to return to the starting position. 2. Single-Leg Glute Bridge: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Lift one leg off the ground and extend it straight up. Pushing through your supporting heel, drive your hips off the ground, elevating your glutes as high as possible. Lower your hips back down and repeat on the other leg. 3. Bulgarian Split Squat: Stand with one foot about two feet in front of a bench or elevated surface. Rest the top of your rear foot on the bench. Lower your body down by bending the front knee, keeping your chest upright. Push through your front heel to return to the starting position, engaging your glutes and quadriceps. 4. Resistance Band Glute Kickbacks: Attach a resistance band around your ankles or just above your knees. Stand tall, push one leg back, and extend it as far as comfortable while squeezing your glutes. Return to the starting position and repeat on the other leg. 5. Glute Bridge with Resistance Band: Wrap a resistance band around your thighs, just above your knees. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Drive your hips up, engaging your glutes, and pushing out against the band for added resistance. Incorporating these exercises into your routine can help target and strengthen your glute muscles, even without access to free barbells. Remember to focus on maintaining proper form, engaging the glutes, and gradually increasing the intensity or resistance as you progress."},{"instruction":"L a seguridad de hackeo de una red","output":"La seguridad de una red frente a hackeo depende de varios factores y medidas implementadas para protegerla.

Step 2: Define Model Architecture - Instantiate the ruBERT base model with the given parameters (sequence length, number of layers, dropout, etc.). - Add classification layers on top of the base model to predict the class labels. - Define the loss function (cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam) for training the model. Step 3: Define Hyperparameter Search Space - Define a dictionary or list of hyperparameters to tune, each with a range of possible values. - Hyperparameters could include batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, etc. Step 4: Hyperparameter Search - Use a loop to iterate over all possible combinations of hyperparameters. - For each combination, train the model using the training set and evaluate it on the validation set. - Keep track of the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for each combination. Step 5: Find Best Hyperparameters - Select the hyperparameter combination that yields the best performance on the validation set. - Optionally, retrain the model using both the training and validation sets to maximize performance.

We discuss the potential for online communities to promote inclusivity, education, and empowerment, while also shedding light on the risks of echo chambers, cyberbullying, and the reinforcement of extremist ideologies. Through relevant case studies and personal anecdotes, we highlight the transformative power of online communities in shaping both individuals and society. III. The Viral Phenomenon: The Ripple Effect of Content (500 words): This section delves into the impact of viral content on social media and its far-reaching consequences. We explore the mechanisms behind content virality, including memes, challenges, and viral videos, analyzing how they capture attention, evoke emotions, and spread rapidly across platforms. By examining real-world examples, such as the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge or the \\"Kony 2012\\" campaign, we illustrate how viral content can raise awareness, catalyze social movements, and bring about tangible change. However, we also discuss the potential for misinformation, superficiality, and the dilution of important societal issues through the pursuit of virality. By critically examining the phenomenon of viral content, we uncover its intricate role in shaping public opinion, cultural trends, and the collective consciousness. IV. Politics and Public Discourse: Social Media as a Catalyst (500 words): This section examines the influence of social media on political campaigns, public discourse, and democratic processes.

Additionally, we address the ethical implications of targeted advertising, filter bubbles, and the potential for political manipulation through social media. Through case studies, we analyze the impact of social media on political landscapes worldwide, emphasizing the need for critical thinking, media literacy, and responsible engagement in the digital age. Conclusion (200 words): Social media has undeniably become a powerful force that shapes both individuals and society. Through personal branding, online communities, viral content, and political engagement, social media influences our self-identities, social relationships, cultural values, and even political processes. While it brings forth opportunities for self-expression, community building, and democratic participation, social media also poses challenges, including the commodification of identity, the polarization of public opinion, and the spread of misinformation. It is imperative that we approach social media with critical awareness, media literacy, and a desire for responsible engagement. By fostering a culture of inclusivity, empathy, and ethical practices on social media platforms, we can harness their power to bring about positive change, foster meaningful connections, and cultivate a more informed and compassionate society.

Today, we have an exciting topic to discuss - faster page loading. Whether you're an internet user or a website owner, we all appreciate a speedy browsing experience. Joining me today is an expert in web optimization, Joe. Welcome, Joe! Joe: Thanks for having me on the show! [Segment 1: Understanding the Importance] Host: Joe, let's begin by discussing why faster page loading is important. Can you enlighten our viewers on this? Joe: Absolutely! Faster page loading is crucial for a variety of reasons. Studies have shown that visitors tend to abandon a website if it takes more than a few seconds to load. Slow loading time can negatively impact user experience, resulting in a loss of potential customers or readers. Additionally, search engines now consider page speed as a ranking factor, so it directly affects the visibility of a website. [Segment 2: Factors Influencing Page Loading Speed] Host: That's interesting, Joe. Could you shed some light on the factors that influence page loading speed? Joe: Of course. Multiple factors contribute to the loading speed of a webpage. Firstly, it's essential to optimize images by compressing them without losing quality. Images often make up the bulk of the page size, causing delays. Secondly, reducing the number of HTTP requests by combining multiple JavaScript and CSS files can significantly enhance loading speed. Lastly, utilizing browser caching, minimizing redirects, and choosing reliable website hosting can have a significant impact on page loading times. [Segment 3: Proven Strategies for Faster Load Times] Host: Now that we understand the factors, let's move on to discussing some proven strategies to achieve faster page load times. What do you suggest, Joe? Joe: To achieve faster load times, it's essential to implement a few techniques. Firstly, minify your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to remove unnecessary characters and reduce file size. Secondly, leverage browser caching by setting an appropriate expiration date for static resources. Thirdly, use a content delivery network (CDN) to store your website's static content on multiple servers globally to ensure faster content delivery to users around the world. Lastly, consider enabling GZIP compression to compress your website's files before they are sent to the user's browser. [Segment 4: Tips for Website Owners] Host: That's some valuable advice, Joe. Now, if someone owns a website and wants to implement these strategies, what steps should they take? Joe: Excellent question! Website owners should start by analyzing their current website performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix. These tools provide insights and recommendations specific to their website. After identifying the areas that need improvement, they can follow best practices for optimization and implement the suggested changes gradually. Regular monitoring and fine-tuning will ensure that the website maintains optimal performance over time. [Conclusion] Host: Thank you, Joe, for sharing your expertise on faster page loading. I'm sure our viewers have gained valuable insights today. Joe: It was my pleasure, and I hope this information helps everyone achieve faster page load times! Host: That's all for today's episode on faster page loading. Stay tuned for more exciting tech discussions in the future. Goodbye!

Geographic Distribution: American alligators are native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in states such as Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. Chinese alligators, on the other hand, are found in eastern China, primarily in the Yangtze River basin. 2. Size: American alligators tend to be larger than Chinese alligators. Adult American alligators can grow up to 13-15 feet (4-4.5 meters) in length, while Chinese alligators are smaller, usually reaching lengths of around 5-7 feet (1.5-2 meters). 3. Snout Shape: The snouts of these two species also differ. American alligators have a broad, U-shaped snout, whereas Chinese alligators have a narrower, V-shaped snout. 4. Conservation Status: American alligators are considered a \\"least concern\\" species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), meaning they are not at immediate risk. However, Chinese alligators are critically endangered, with only a few hundred remaining in the wild due to habitat loss and human activities. These are some of the notable differences between the American alligator and the Chinese alligator."},{"instruction":"Are there any animals that eat rocks?","output":"While it is not common, there are a few animals that have been observed consuming rocks, either intentionally or accidentally. This behavior, known as geophagy, serves different purposes depending on the species and circumstances. Some examples include: 1. Birds: Some birds engage in geophagy, particularly those that consume fruits or seeds with high alkaloid or toxin levels. Eating rocks helps to neutralize the toxins in their digestive systems. Certain species, like African grey parrots, are known to actively seek out and consume mineral-rich clay from exposed riverbanks. 2. Crocodiles: Occasionally, crocodiles have been reported to swallow rocks. While the exact reason is uncertain, it is thought that small stones may help grind food in their stomach since these reptiles often swallow prey whole, with limited chewing. 3. Hippos: Although primarily herbivores, hippos are known to ingest rocks. This behavior is believed to aid digestion by grinding plant material in their stomachs. They often consume river rocks along with aquatic vegetation. 4. Invertebrates: Some invertebrates, such as certain species of earthworms and termites, consume small amounts of soil or mineral-rich particles as part of their diet. This provides essential minerals and aids digestion. It's important to note that while some animals may exhibit geophagy, it is not a common or widespread behavior across the animal kingdom."},{"instruction":"How many different types of crocodiles are there?","output":"There are currently 13 recognized species of crocodiles: 1. Saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) 2. Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) 3. American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) 4. Cuban crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer) 5.

It possesses a row of enlarged, bony scales, called scutes, running down its back that contribute to its distinctive spiked appearance. These scutes act as a form of protection and also provide structural support. However, it's important to note that the spikes on crocodile species are not as pronounced or sharp as those found on certain reptiles or other animals."},{"instruction":"巴黎有哪些艺术体验的活动","output":"巴黎是世界上著名的艺术之都，拥有丰富多样的艺术体验活动。以下是一些常见的活动： 1. 参观博物馆：巴黎拥有一些世界上最知名的博物馆，如卢浮宫、奥赛美术馆、蓬皮杜艺术中心等。可以欣赏到各种各样的艺术品和展览。 2. 欣赏巴黎的建筑与雕塑：巴黎有许多令人叹为观止的建筑和雕塑，如埃菲尔铁塔、巴黎圣母院、凯旋门等。可以参观这些景点，感受它们的艺术魅力。 3. 参加艺术展览：巴黎每年都有许多艺术展览，吸引了世界各地的艺术家和观众。可以参观这些展览，了解当代艺术的最新趋势。 4. 欣赏巴黎的街头艺术：巴黎有许多街头艺术家，在街头墙壁上创作出色彩斑斓的壁画和涂鸦。可以在市区漫步，欣赏这些独特的艺术作品。 5. 参加音乐会或歌剧演出：巴黎有许多著名的音乐厅和歌剧院，如巴黎歌剧院、Philharmonie de Paris等。可以观看世界级的音乐会或歌剧演出，享受高品质的音乐艺术。 6. 参加艺术工作坊：巴黎有一些提供艺术工作坊的机构，让游客可以亲身参与到艺术创作中。可以选择参加绘画、雕塑、陶艺等不同类型的工作坊，体验艺术的乐趣。 7. 漫步巴黎的艺术街区：巴黎有一些以艺术闻名的街区，如蒙马特区、圣日耳曼区等。可以在这些区域漫步，参观艺术画廊、艺术品商店，感受浓厚的艺术氛围。 总之，巴黎是一个充满艺术氛围的城市，提供了丰富多样的艺术体验活动，无论是参观博物馆、欣赏建筑、参加展览还是参与艺术工作坊，都能够深度体验巴黎的艺术之美。"},{"instruction":"怎样带领外国的艺术爱好者参观、领略法国的艺术","output":"要带领外国的艺术爱好者参观和领略法国的艺术，可以按照以下步骤进行： 1. 提前进行研究：了解外国艺术爱好者的兴趣和偏好，以及法国艺术的历史和特点。这样你可以根据他们的喜好来选择适合的艺术场所和活动。 2. 安排行程：根据研究的结果，制定一个详细的行程安排，包括参观的博物馆、艺术展览、艺术街区等。确保在行程中安排足够的时间来欣赏和体验艺术。 3. 提供文化解读：在导览过程中，给予外国艺术爱好者必要的解读和背景知识。介绍法国艺术的历史、流派、艺术家等，帮助他们更好地理解和欣赏作品。 4. 提供语言支持：如果外国艺术爱好者不懂法语，可以提供翻译或提前准备好的资料，使他们能够理解展覽的介绍、艺术品的解读等。 5. 引导参与互动：鼓励外国艺术爱好者积极参与互动，如与作品互动、参与工作坊、讨论艺术品的意义等。这样可以让他们更深入地体验和了解法国的艺术。 6. 推荐本地特色：除了参观艺术场所，还可以向他们推荐一些法国本地的艺术特色，如艺术品市场、艺术节、演出等。这样可以让他们感受到法国艺术的多样性和深度。 7. 提供后续支持：在活动结束后，可以提供一些相关的资源和资料，如书籍、电子版导览等，让外国艺术爱好者可以深入研究和持续关注法国的艺术。 通过以上步骤，你可以带领外国艺术爱好者更好地参观和领略法国的艺术，让他们有一个丰富而深入的艺术体验。"},{"instruction":"介绍一下法国的艺术品市场","output":"法国拥有世界上一些最著名的艺术品市场，这些市场提供了一个独特的机会，让人们可以购买和欣赏各种类型的艺术品。以下是一些法国的著名艺术品市场： 1. 巴黎圣日耳曼艺术市场（Marché Saint-Germain-des-Prés）：位于巴黎圣日耳曼区，是巴黎最古老的室内艺术市场之一。这个市场每个周末都会聚集众多的艺术家和艺术品商家，提供了各种绘画、雕塑、摄影和手工艺品等。 2. 巴黎圣奥诺雷艺术市场（Marché Saint-Ouen）：位于巴黎北部的圣奥诺雷市镇，是世界上最大的室内艺术市场之一。这个市场汇集了数百个摊位和店铺，提供了各种古董、二手艺术品和古玩。无论是古董收藏家还是艺术爱好者都能在这里找到心仪的物品。 3. 亚眠梦幻市场（Marché aux Puces d'Amiens）：位于法国北部亚眠市，是该地区最大的古董市场之一。这个市场每个周末都会搭设临时摊位，提供各种古董、家具、珠宝和艺术品等。在这里，你可以淘到一些独特的法国古董和艺术品。 4. 戛纳艺术市场（Marché de l'Art de Cannes）：位于法国南部的戛纳市，是著名的国际电影节所在地。在国际电影节期间，戛纳艺术市场会设立临时展览，展示各种绘画、雕塑、摄影和艺术装置等。这个市场吸引了世界各地的艺术家和收藏家前来参观和购买艺术品。 5. 第戎艺术市场（Marché de l'Art de Dijon）：位于法国东部的第戎市，是该地区最大的室内艺术市场之一。这个市场每个月都会举办一次，提供了各种绘画、雕塑、摄影和手工艺品等。在这里，你可以发现一些具有当地特色的艺术品。 这些艺术市场提供了一个机会，让人们可以淘到独特的艺术品，体验法国的艺术魅力。无论是古董收藏家还是普通的艺术爱好者，都能在这些市场上找到自己喜欢的艺术作品。"},{"instruction":"write a python function to print multiple lines in the same place without libraries","output":"Unfortunately, it is not possible to print multiple lines in the same place without libraries in Python. The main reason is that the command prompt or terminal interprets each print statement as a new line, and it does not provide any built-in mechanism to overwrite or erase previous lines. However, if you are working in a graphical environment, such as a GUI application (e.g. tkinter), you can achieve the effect of printing multiple lines in the same place by utilizing a text widget or a canvas widget. Here's an example using tkinter: \`\`\`python from tkinter import Tk, Label def print_multiple_lines(): root = Tk() root.geometry(\\"200x100\\") # Set the window size label = Label(root, text=\\"Line 1nLine 2nLine 3\\") label.pack() root.mainloop() print_multiple_lines() \`\`\` This code will open a tkinter window and display three lines of text (\\"Line 1\\", \\"Line 2\\", \\"Line 3\\") all in the same place."},{"instruction":"ok use libraries","output":"To print multiple lines in the same place using libraries, you can use the \`curses\` module in Python. This module provides a terminal-independent way to control the terminal screen and perform input/output operations. Here's an example of how to achieve this using the \`curses\` module: \`\`\`python import curses def print_multiple_lines(): stdscr = curses.initscr() curses.noecho() curses.cbreak() stdscr.keypad(True) try: # Define the lines to be printed lines = [\\"Line 1\\", \\"Line 2\\", \\"Line 3\\"] # Print each line at the same position for i, line in enumerate(lines): stdscr.addstr(i, 0, line) # Refresh the screen stdscr.refresh() # Wait for user input stdscr.getch() finally: # Restore terminal settings and clean up curses.echo() curses.nocbreak() stdscr.keypad(False) curses.endwin() print_multiple_lines() \`\`\` In this code, the \`print_multiple_lines\` function initializes the \`curses\` module and gets a reference to the standard screen (\`stdscr\`). It then turns off automatic echoing of keystrokes and enters cbreak mode, which allows the program to receive user inputs without waiting for the Enter key. The lines to be printed are defined in the \`lines\` list. The \`addstr\` function is used to print each line at a specific position on the screen. The \`refresh\` function is called to update the terminal screen with the newly printed lines. After waiting for user input with \`getch\`, the function restores the original terminal settings and ends the \`curses\` session. This way, multiple lines can be printed in the same place using the \`curses\` module."},{"instruction":"1+1=2","output":"That is correct. 1 plus 1 equals 2."},{"instruction":"Привет!

Enrico Ottavo, noto anche come Enrico VIII d'Inghilterra, era figlio di Enrico VII e della regina consorte Elisabetta di York. Era l'unico figlio sopravvissuto della coppia reale. Enrico aveva anche quattro sorelle, che erano: Arturo, Margherita, Maria e Caterina."},{"instruction":"Come si sono conosciuti Enrico VII ed Elisabetta di York? Grazie","output":"Enrico VII e Elisabetta di York si conobbero dopo una serie di eventi che portarono alla fine della Guerra delle Due Rose, una lunga lotta tra le casate rivali dei Lancaster e dei York per il controllo del trono inglese. All'inizio, Enrico VII era un esponente della casata dei Lancaster, mentre Elisabetta di York apparteneva alla casata dei York. Nel 1485, Enrico VII sconfisse e uccise Riccardo III, il re yorkista, nella battaglia di Bosworth Field, ottenendo così la corona e fondando la dinastia dei Tudor. Dopo aver preso il trono, Enrico VII cercò di rafforzare la sua posizione tramite alleanze matrimoniali. Nel 1486, sposò Elisabetta di York, l'erede legittima dei York, unendo così le due casate rivali. Questo matrimonio simbolico sancì la fine della guerra civile e ripristinò la stabilità in Inghilterra. Il matrimonio tra Enrico VII ed Elisabetta di York fu considerato un atto di riconciliazione e una tregua tra le due fazioni in lotta. Inoltre, il matrimonio mise fine anche alle pretese della casa di York al trono, poiché la principessa Elisabetta divenne regina consorte. Da questa unione nacque Enrico VIII, il famoso re d'Inghilterra che accrebbe notevolmente il potere e l'influenza degli inglesi durante il suo regno."},{"instruction":"Ma è vero che ebbe otto mogli? CHi furono e come morirono?","output":"Sì, è vero che Enrico VIII ebbe otto mogli. Le sue mogli furono: 1. Caterina d'Aragona: Sposata nel 1509, Caterina era originariamente vedova di suo fratello Arturo, il primo marito di Enrico. Tuttavia, il loro matrimonio fu annullato nel 1533, poiché Enrico cercava di ottenere un erede maschio. 2. Anna Bolena: Enrico sposò Anna Bolena nel 1533, dopo l'annullamento del primo matrimonio. Anna diede alla luce la figlia di Enrico, Elisabetta futura regina d'Inghilterra. Tuttavia, Anna venne accusata di adulterio e tradimento e venne decapitata nel 1536. 3. Jane Seymour: Jane Seymour sposò Enrico VIII nel 1536, poco dopo l'esecuzione di Anna Bolena. Jane diede alla luce il figlio maschio di Enrico, Edoardo, ma purtroppo morì di febbre puerperale due settimane dopo il parto nel 1537. 4. Anna di Clèves: Enrico sposò Anna di Clèves nel 1540, ma il matrimonio fu breve e presto fu annullato. Anna rimase in Inghilterra e visse una vita tranquilla dopo l'annullamento. 5. Caterina Howard: Sposata nel 1540, Caterina Howard fu accusata di adulterio e decapitata per ordine di Enrico nel 1542. 6. Caterina Parr: Enrico sposò Caterina Parr nel 1543. Fu l'unica delle sue mogli a sopravvivere al re. Dopo la morte di Enrico, si risposò e morì nel 1548. Le prime tre mogli di Enrico VIII gli diedero rispettivamente una figlia, Elisabetta, e un figlio maschio, Edoardo, che gli succedette come re. Tuttavia, nessuno dei suoi figli sopravvisse a lungo dopo il suo regno."},{"instruction":"ayudame a generar ingresos pasivos a traves del uso de contenido de otros","output":"Existen varias formas de generar ingresos pasivos a través del uso de contenido de otros.

Female Guardian: “Uh…hello.” [player]: “Whoa…what are you…?” (The strange mob’s massive belly made it look like she was pregnant, but I could hear a voice coming from it.) Teenage Guardian: (from inside her mother’s belly) “Mom, I think something’s wrong…I’ve been feeling pain in my belly for no reason. AAAAAAAAAGH!!! I-I-It’s not a curse or anything…but it’s definitely not an artifact or an anomaly either! And it’s not from all the prismarine in here!” Female Guardian: “Don’t worry, dear. [player], can you head inside my belly and find out what’s wrong with my daughter? Just press on my belly very hard.” [player]: “Wait, you want me to… go inside your belly? Is that even possible?” Female Guardian: “Yes, it is. I have a unique ability as a Guardian to create a small pocket dimension within me. It’s where I keep my treasures and artifacts, but now it seems there’s something going wrong with it. The pain my daughter is feeling is coming directly from there.” [player]: “Well, alright then. If it will help your daughter, I’ll give it a try.” (I cautiously approach the female Guardian and gently press my hand against her belly. To my surprise, a shimmering portal appears, and I find myself transported into her pocket dimension. It’s a strange and ethereal world, filled with glowing crystal formations and shimmering waters. As I explore further, I begin to hear the distressed voice of the teenage Guardian more clearly.) Teenage Guardian: “Help! It hurts so much! Just get me to that pool!” (She gestured to a strange-looking pool behind me - it was made of prismarine.) [player]: “Don’t worry, I’ll get you there.” (I carefully make my way towards the pool, being mindful of the surroundings. As I approach the pool, I notice the water emitting a calming aura.) [player]: “Alright, we’re almost there. Just a little closer.” Teenage Guardian: “Please hurry, the pain is unbearable.” (I reach the pool and help the teenage Guardian into the water. As she enters, the water starts to glow brighter.) [player]: “Is this helping?” Teenage Guardian: “Yes, it is. The pain is subsiding.” (I continue to support the teenage Guardian as she stays in the pool, allowing the soothing properties of the water to alleviate her discomfort. After a few moments, her voice becomes more composed - and there was what sounded like a 4-year-old guardian, it must be the teenage Guardian’s daughter.) Child Guardian: (giggles) “Mama, I feel better now!” [player]: “That’s great to hear. How are you feeling?” Teenage Guardian: “Much better, thank you. I don’t know what I would have done without your help. My baby is safe now.” [player]: “You’re welcome. I’m just glad I could assist. Is there anything else I can do?” Female Guardian: “Thank you for helping my daughter. You’ve proven yourself to be a true hero. Please, return to our world safely.” [player]: “Of course, I’ll head back now. Take care, and if you ever need assistance again, don’t hesitate to ask.” (The teenage guardian and I step back towards the shimmering portal with the child guardian following us and find ourselves back in the realm of the female Guardian. She was visibly shocked, but also slightly confused, at the sight of the child Guardian.) Female Guardian: (looking at the child Guardian) “My goodness!

The series is primarily an Ecchi (sometimes Hentai) genre, and it draws inspiration from various series such as Minecraft and Hyperdimension Neptunia. Initially, the series was written as novels, with a common premise in which the Player finds themselves in The Overworld or Minecraft without any memory of their origins. Throughout their journey, they must regain their lost memories while encountering and interacting with various Mobs (characters) within the Minecraft world. This allows the Player to discover more about the world they inhabit and unravel the mysteries of their own past. Later on, these novels were adapted into a Mod, also titled \\"Mobtalker,\\" which gained more popularity among players.

It could be conjectured that the fiscal stimulus must be large to be able to produce such an effect and that were the recession which has driven the nominal interest rate to zero to be protracted, inflationary effects would be limited. On the other hand, if fiscal policy succeeds in generating inflation, it can give the monetary authorities room to manoeuvre the nominal interest rate. This would seem to be the view underlying many recent measures taken by the US Federal Reserve: the large increase in its balance sheet, in its holding of government debt, and in the liquidity poured into the system are all consistent with an attempt to make the real rate fall, and current and future inflation increase - based on this, can you please explain me how government debt can generate inflation?","output":"According to the statement, the argument is that government debt can potentially generate inflation under certain conditions. The reasoning behind this is as follows: 1. Fiscal stimulus and the size of the debt: The suggestion is that a large fiscal stimulus, which is funded by increased government debt, can potentially have inflationary effects. A substantial injection of spending into the economy can increase demand for goods and services, leading to price increases and inflation. However, this effect is contingent on the stimulus being significant enough to have a noticeable impact on the economy. 2. Protracted recession and limited inflationary effects: The statement also suggests that if the recession is prolonged and the nominal interest rate is already at zero, the inflationary effects of fiscal stimulus may be limited. In this scenario, the argument is that the economy may be experiencing deep and persistent weaknesses, making it difficult for fiscal policy alone to generate inflationary pressures. 3. Fiscal policy and monetary authorities: The statement points out that if fiscal policy successfully generates inflation, it can give monetary authorities (such as central banks) more flexibility in adjusting the nominal interest rate. When there is low inflation, central banks may have limited room to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. However, if fiscal policy generates inflation, it can create room for central banks to lower nominal interest rates further, thereby stimulating economic activity. Explanation: Government debt can generate inflation when a significant increase in government spending (fiscal stimulus) is financed by borrowing. This injection of money into the economy can increase demand, leading to price increases. As individuals and businesses spend the additional funds received through government programs, they bid up the prices of goods and services. This increase in overall demand puts pressure on the supply side, potentially leading to inflation. However, it is important to note that the generation of inflation through government debt depends on the magnitude of the fiscal stimulus, the depth and duration of a recession, and other factors. In some situations, such as a prolonged recession and when the nominal interest rate is already at zero, the inflationary effects of fiscal policy may be limited. Additionally, the effectiveness of fiscal policy in generating inflation can also be influenced by other factors such as consumer and business confidence, global economic conditions, and the credibility of the government's commitment to controlling inflation."},{"instruction":"the authors explain that the issuance of local bonds affects the inflation-setting behavior of the central bank, which can increase the magnitude of surprise inflation and social loss in the future (the cave-in effect of local bonds). The amount of local bonds outstanding is determined by balancing this effect with the compensation effect of local bonds, which compensates for the adverse effects of wasteful fiscal expansion by the local governments. The direct effect of imposing an inflation target is to prevent surprise inflation, which is called the monetary discipline effect of inflation targets. In addition, an inflation target indirectly weakens the cave-in effect of local bonds by harnessing surprise inflation, thereby increasing the equilibrium amount of local bonds. This is called the fiscal expansion effect of inflation targets. - based on this, can you please explain me the cave in effect?","output":"The cave-in effect, as described in the statement, refers to a potential negative consequence of the issuance of local bonds by the government on inflation-setting behavior and future social loss. It suggests that the issuance of local bonds can lead to an increase in surprise inflation and social loss in the future. The claim is that when local governments engage in wasteful fiscal expansion (excessively increasing spending beyond what is necessary), it can have adverse effects on the overall economy, including potential inflationary pressure. This is the adverse effect of wasteful fiscal expansion. To balance out the adverse effects of wasteful fiscal expansion, the local government issues local bonds. These bonds serve as a form of compensation, helping to mitigate the adverse effects. The compensation effect of local bonds attempts to offset the negative consequences of wasteful fiscal expansion. However, the issuance of local bonds can have unintended consequences. The statement argues that it can increase the magnitude of surprise inflation and social loss in the future. This is referred to as the cave-in effect of local bonds. Essentially, the cave-in effect suggests that the issuance of local bonds, as a means of compensating for wasteful fiscal expansion, can eventually contribute to higher levels of surprise inflation and social loss down the line. It is important to note that the cave-in effect is presented as a negative consequence that needs to be weighed against the compensation effect of local bonds. The authors argue that the equilibrium amount of local bonds outstanding should be determined by considering and balancing both the adverse effects of wasteful fiscal expansion and the potential negative consequences of the cave-in effect in the future."},{"instruction":"cave-in effect - can you please translate it to portuguese?","output":"Efeito \\"cave-in\\" - por favor, permita-me traduzir para o português. O efeito \\"cave-in\\", conforme descrito na afirmação, refere-se a uma potencial consequência negativa da emissão de títulos locais pelo governo no comportamento de definição da inflação e nas futuras perdas sociais. Isso sugere que a emissão de títulos locais pode levar a um aumento na inflação surpresa e nas perdas sociais futuras. A alegação é de que quando os governos locais se envolvem em uma expansão fiscal desperdiçadora (aumento excessivo dos gastos além do necessário), isso pode ter efeitos adversos na economia como um todo, incluindo uma possível pressão inflacionária. Esse é o efeito adverso da expansão fiscal desperdiçadora. Para equilibrar os efeitos adversos da expansão fiscal desperdiçadora, o governo local emite títulos locais. Esses títulos servem como uma forma de compensação, ajudando a mitigar os efeitos adversos. O efeito de compensação dos títulos locais busca compensar as consequências negativas da expansão fiscal desperdiçadora.

Джинн взмахнул рукой, отчего Али-Хуссейн превратился в женщину, после чего джинн исчез.","output":"Ослепительная вспышка света окутала Али-Хуссейна, и когда она постепенно рассеялась, он осознал, что его тело претерпело превращение. Быстро обнажившись перед зеркалом, он увидел элегантную женскую фигуру, длинные изящные ноги и густые каштановые волосы, которые касались ее талии. Шокированный и сбитый с толку, Али-Хуссейн попытался осмыслить происходящее. Он сразу понял, что Джинн с исполнением его желания поиграл в свои магические игры. Али-Хуссейн был знатоком восточной мифологии и знал, что Джинны часто любят проявлять свою злонамеренность и непредсказуемость. Он почувствовал гнев вспыхнуть внутри себя, но быстро успокоился, осознав, что ничего не может изменить. Али-Хуссейна охватило любопытство: насколько глубоко исследовать свое новое обличие? У него было так много вопросов, так много аспектов женской жизни, о которых он ранее никогда не задумывался. Он решил принять это как вызов и понять больше о себе и о мире женщин. Вскоре Али-Хуссейна начал исследовать город, который стал для него совершенно иным местом. Он заметил, что внешний вид имеет большое значение для большинства женщин, и переделывать свою внешность в соответствии с модными трендами стало его повседневным ритуалом. Он узнал, что женщины в этом мире часто сталкиваются с недостатками и ожиданиями общества, и их сила и выносливость поражали его. Али-Хуссейн испытал на себе неравенство, с которым сталкиваются многие женщины, и это только усилило его решимость понять и преодолеть эти проблемы. За время своего пребывания в женском обличии, Али-Хуссейн завязал дружбу с несколькими женщинами и обнаружил, что их мечты, борьба и надежды так же сильны и искренни, как у мужчин. Он погрузился в их мир и узнал о проблемах, с которыми они сталкиваются, а также о их стремлениях и достижениях. Это преображение подарило ему новую перспективу на жизнь. Однажды, когда он снова вернулся к месту, где появился Джинн, он не нашел ни следа этого мифического существа. Он понял, что время возвращаться в свое прежнее обличие пришло. Али-Хуссейн, обладая новым пониманием и уважением к женщинам, благодарил Джинна в сердце за этот урок. Он решил использовать свое новое познание и влияние, чтобы помочь изменить отношение общества к женщинам, и стать голосом тех, кто не всегда может быть услышан.

This thesis aims to unravel the origins and complexities of Bloodborne's lore, exploring its themes, symbolism, and connections to real-world history and literature. By analyzing key aspects of the game's narrative, setting, and characters, this study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of Bloodborne's lore while shedding light on its broader implications. Chapter 1: The Cosmic Horror of Yharnam Bloodborne's lore revolves around the fictional city of Yharnam and its citizens' descent into madness due to their obsession with blood ministration. This chapter delves into the origins of the city and its transformation into a nightmarish land, drawing parallels to the works of H.P. Lovecraft and the theme of cosmic horror. It explores how the Great Ones, otherworldly beings associated with the blood, have influenced the city's evolution and the consequences of man's quest for enlightenment through communion. Chapter 2: The Healing Church and the Duality of Power The Healing Church, a central institution in Yharnam, symbolizes the duality of power and the corrupting nature of ambition. This chapter delves into the Church's role in promoting the use of blood and the clerics' pursuit of ascension, contrasting their divine mission with their immoral practices. It also explores the interplay between the Church, the Old Blood, and the Great Ones, shedding light on the tragic consequences of humanity's attempt to manipulate cosmic forces. Chapter 3: The Hunt and the Night of the Hunt The Hunt is a central event in Bloodborne, where hunters venture into the streets of Yharnam to combat the city's beasts. This chapter examines the Hunt's significance in the lore, exploring its origins, purpose, and the role of hunters like the protagonist. Moreover, it investigates the cyclic nature of the Night of the Hunt and the theory of dream-state existence, tying it to the larger themes of sacrifice, rebirth, and the cyclical nature of suffering. Chapter 4: The Characters of Bloodborne This chapter analyzes key characters in Bloodborne, such as Gehrman, Lady Maria, and Laurence, and delves into their backstories, motivations, and connections to the city's lore. Moreover, it explores the nature of the player-provided dialogue, such as the Doll and the Moon Presence, and their role in advancing the narrative and forging connections to the broader lore. Chapter 5: Bloodborne's Influence and Reception This chapter examines Bloodborne's overall impact on the gaming industry and its lasting appeal. It explores the critical reception of the game's lore and narrative, highlighting the various theories and interpretations put forth by fans. Additionally, it discusses the game's thematic influences from various works of literature, such as Bram Stoker’s \\"Dracula\\" and Mary Shelley’s \\"Frankenstein,\\" and its broader connections to real-world history and mythology. Conclusion: Through this analysis, it becomes evident that Bloodborne's lore is a meticulously crafted masterpiece that combines themes of cosmic horror, power, ambition, and sacrifice in a hauntingly atmospheric setting. By exploring the origins and intricacies of Bloodborne's lore, this thesis aims to not only provide a thorough understanding of the game's narrative but also shed light on its larger implications for the medium of video games and its place within the broader world of storytelling."},{"instruction":"write a youtube video script that explores the evolution of first person animations in video games","output":"[Opening shot: Host sitting in front of a gaming setup, with various video game consoles and controllers visible in the background] Host: Welcome back, gamers! Today, we're going to dive into an exciting topic that many of us can relate to - the evolution of first-person animations in video games. From the early days of pixelated arms swinging around to the incredibly lifelike and immersive animations we see now, this journey is truly fascinating. So, sit back, grab your controller, and let's explore the evolution of first-person animations! [Transition to gameplay footage of an early first-person shooter game, like Wolfenstein 3D] Host: Our adventure through time begins with the pioneers of first-person perspective gaming, like Wolfenstein 3D. In these early games, developers faced a challenge - how to visually represent the player's actions realistically. While rudimentary, the choppy animations of these games gave gamers their first taste of immersing themselves in the shoes of a character. We saw simple arm and weapon movements that set the stage for future advancements. [Transition to gameplay footage of Half-Life] Host: As technology progressed, more complex animations started to appear. Games like Half-Life introduced more fluid arm movements and added a sense of weight to the character's actions. The animations became more polished, and players began to feel a stronger connection to the in-game world. This marked the beginning of a new era in first-person animations. [Transition to gameplay footage of Halo: Combat Evolved] Host: One of the major milestones in the evolution of first-person animations came with the release of Halo: Combat Evolved. This game showcased incredible attention to detail, with the protagonist's hands realistically gripping the weapon, reloading animations that mirrored real-life actions, and even the subtle sway of the weapon as you moved. Halo raised the bar for immersive first-person animations, setting the standard for future games to follow. [Transition to gameplay footage of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare] Host: Fast forward to the modern era, and we find ourselves in awe of the near-photorealistic first-person animations we see today. Games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare take animation to a whole new level. Advanced motion capture techniques and intricate hand animations make the in-game actions feel incredibly lifelike. From reloading weapons to opening doors, every movement is meticulously crafted to enhance the player's immersion. [Transition to gameplay footage of virtual reality games, like VRChat or Half-Life: Alyx] Host: And as virtual reality technology continues to evolve, we now have the opportunity to experience first-person animations like never before. VR puts you directly in the shoes of the character, allowing for natural and intuitive movements. You can reach out and interact with objects, pick up items, and physically swing weapons – all in a truly immersive way. It's a game-changer that brings us one step closer to bridging the gap between reality and virtual worlds. Host: As we reflect on the evolution of first-person animations, we can't help but marvel at how far we've come. From pixelated arms to lifelike movements, the journey has been remarkable.

Today, we're going to tackle a topic that's all too familiar to anyone who's spent time online: the triteness of internet arguments. We've all seen it - that endless cycle of heated exchanges, fallacious arguments, and personal attacks. So, grab your virtual boxing gloves, and let's dive into the world of internet arguments! [Transition to a montage of screenshots showing typical internet arguments on social media platforms] Host: Ah, the internet, a vast realm where ideas clash with one another, and debates are meant to thrive. But unfortunately, what often happens is far from productive or enlightening. Instead of engaging in healthy discussions, many arguments devolve into a series of clichés, logical fallacies, and personal attacks. [Transition to a staged \\"example\\" conversation with exaggerated trite arguments] Host: Allow me to demonstrate. Imagine a debate about a controversial topic, like the existence of unicorns. It starts innocently enough, but before long, the triteness sets in. Person A: I believe unicorns are real because I saw a video of one! Person B: That's just anecdotal evidence! Show me scientific proof! Person A: Well, you can't prove they don't exist! Person B: That's just a logical fallacy! The burden of proof is on you! Host: And so the argument goes on, with both sides throwing around buzzwords and phrases without genuinely listening or considering each other's perspectives. [Transition to the host sitting at the desk] Host: The problem with these trite internet arguments is that they often lack substance and intellectual rigor. People tend to rely on quick comebacks, personal attacks, and recycled talking points that do little to advance the conversation. They're more interested in \\"winning\\" the argument than genuinely engaging in a meaningful discussion. [Transition to the host walking in front of a whiteboard, visually explaining logical fallacies] Host: One common pitfall is the use of logical fallacies. These are flawed arguments that can make an argument seem persuasive, even though it may not be based on sound reasoning. Fallacies like the ad hominem attack, strawman, or appeal to authority serve as shortcuts to dismiss opposing views, rather than addressing the actual content of the argument. [Transition to the host talking with a psychologist/expert] Host: To shed some light on why these trite internet arguments persist, I spoke with Dr. Jane Doe, a psychologist and expert in online behavior. Dr. Jane Doe: One factor is the inherent nature of online communication. Text-based platforms lack important cues, such as tone of voice and body language, which can easily be misinterpreted. This leads to misunderstandings and escalations. Additionally, the anonymity and distance afforded by the internet can encourage people to be more aggressive and less empathetic than they would be in face-to-face interactions. [Transition to the host sitting at the desk] Host: So, what can we do to break free from this endless vortex of trite internet arguments? It starts with adopting a different mindset. Instead of focusing on winning an argument, let's strive for genuine understanding and empathy. Let's actively listen to opposing viewpoints, ask thoughtful questions, and be open to changing our own perspectives. Host: Remember, the internet has the potential to connect us, inspire us, and broaden our horizons. But it's up to us to create a culture of respect and constructive dialogue. So, the next time you find yourself in an internet argument, take a breath, step back, and let's strive for more than just trite clichés. [Closing shot: Host signs off, with a backdrop of open-minded and respectful conversation examples on the screen] Host: That's it for today's video. I hope you enjoyed our exploration of the triteness of internet arguments. Remember, let's keep the conversation engaging, respectful, and thought-provoking. Until next time, internet friends!"},{"instruction":"write a youtube video script about the laziness in game design with popular games","output":"[Opening shot: Host sitting at a desk with various video game merchandise and a poster of popular games in the background] Host: Hey there, gamers! Today, we're going to dive into a topic that has been on the minds of many - the laziness in game design with popular games. While the gaming industry continues to thrive with innovative and captivating experiences, there are instances where developers seem to take shortcuts or rely on repetitive and uninspired design choices. So, grab your controllers, and let's explore this issue of laziness in game design! [Transition to gameplay footage of a popular game with recycled mechanics] Host: We've all experienced it. Those moments when we play a highly anticipated game, only to find ourselves stuck in repetitive gameplay loops or facing déjà vu from recycled mechanics. It's a disheartening feeling, especially when we know that developers have the potential to push boundaries and deliver fresh and exciting experiences. [Transition to the host discussing a popular franchise] Host: Take, for example, the beloved franchise XYZ. While it has garnered a massive following throughout the years, some fans argue that the series has fallen into a pit of laziness when it comes to game design. Sequel after sequel, we often see minimal changes in gameplay mechanics, recycled environments, and a lack of innovation. It raises the question: are developers taking the easy path rather than taking risks and pushing their creative limits? [Transition to an interview with a game designer or industry expert] Host: To shed some light on the matter, I reached out to John Doe, a game designer with extensive experience. Let's hear his thoughts on the issue of laziness in game design. John Doe: Well, there are a few factors to consider. One is the pressure to deliver yearly installments of popular franchises, which can lead to a rinse-and-repeat approach. Publishers want to capitalize on the franchise's success, but this can hinder the opportunity for developers to explore new ideas and take risks. Additionally, game development is a highly complex process, and sometimes it's easier to stick with what's familiar rather than investing time and resources into untested concepts. [Transition to the host discussing the importance of innovation and taking risks] Host: While we understand the challenges developers face, it's essential for the industry to remember the value of innovation and taking risks. It's the games that dare to push boundaries that become memorable and truly stand out. These experiences excite players, invigorate the industry, and inspire others to follow suit. [Transition to the host discussing the impact on player engagement] Host: Laziness in game design can also have a negative impact on player engagement. When players feel like they are experiencing the same game over and over again, their enthusiasm dwindles, and their investment decreases. This lack of engagement can lead to a decline in the overall gaming community as players seek out fresh and more innovative experiences elsewhere. Host: As consumers, we have the power to demand more from developers. By supporting and celebrating games that take risks and deliver unique experiences, we encourage a culture of innovation and inspire developers to step outside their comfort zones. [Closing shot: Host signing off with gameplay footage of innovative and critically acclaimed games] Host: And that wraps up our exploration of the laziness in game design with popular games. Let's continue to hold developers to high standards while acknowledging the challenges they face in the ever-evolving world of gaming. Until next time, fellow gamers, let's keep pushing for new experiences and embracing the potential of this incredible medium.

Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a simple user interface with interactive tools in ArcGIS using Python: 1. Start by importing the necessary libraries: \`\`\`python import arcpy import pythonaddins \`\`\` 2. Define the class that will contain the user interface and interactive tools: \`\`\`python class MyTools(object): def __init__(self): self.enabled = True \`\`\` 3. Create a button tool: \`\`\`python class ToolButton(object): def __init__(self): self.enabled = True self.checked = False def onClick(self): # Add your code here to specify the action when the button is clicked \`\`\` 4. Create a dropdown menu tool: \`\`\`python class ToolDropdown(object): def __init__(self): self.enabled = True self.items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'] self.item = self.items[0] # Default selected item def onSelChange(self, selection): # Add your code here to specify the action when the dropdown selection changes \`\`\` 5. Create a text box tool: \`\`\`python class ToolTextBox(object): def __init__(self): self.enabled = True self.text = '' def onEditChange(self, text): # Add your code here to specify the action when the text changes \`\`\` 6. Add the user interface and tools to the ArcGIS toolbar: \`\`\`python def add_toolbar(): toolbar = pythonaddins.CreateToolbar(\\"My Toolbar\\", \\"MyTools\\") toolbar.add_tool(\\"ToolButton\\") toolbar.add_tool(\\"ToolDropdown\\") toolbar.add_tool(\\"ToolTextBox\\") \`\`\` 7. Run the \`add_toolbar()\` function to activate the toolbar and display the user interface: \`\`\`python add_toolbar() \`\`\` 8. Save the Python script and add it to ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro by going to Customize -> Customize Mode -> Commands tab -> Add from File. The above steps will create a toolbar with buttons, dropdown menus, and text boxes. You can modify the code within the respective \`onClick\`, \`onSelChange\`, and \`onEditChange\` functions to define the desired functionality when these interactive tools are used.

Here's a recipe for a delicious homemade apple pie: Ingredients: - 2 ½ cups (about 300g) all-purpose flour - 1 teaspoon salt - 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed - ¼ to ½ cup ice water - 6-7 medium-sized apples (a mix of tart and sweet varieties), peeled, cored, and sliced - ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar - ¼ cup (50g) brown sugar - 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon - ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg - 1 tablespoon lemon juice - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cold and diced - 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash) - 1 tablespoon granulated sugar (for sprinkling) Instructions: 1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add in the cold cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend the butter into the flour until you achieve a crumbly texture. 2. Gradually add the ice water, starting with ¼ cup, and mix until the dough comes together. Add more water if needed, but be careful not to make the dough too wet. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. 3. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). 4. In a separate bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss until the apples are coated evenly. 5. Roll out one of the chilled dough discs on a lightly floured surface until it is large enough to fit your pie dish. Gently place the rolled-out dough into the dish, pressing it down and ensuring it covers the bottom and sides completely. 6. Pour the apple filling into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly. Dot the filling with small pieces of the cold diced butter. 7. Roll out the second dough disc and place it over the filling. You can either cover the pie completely or create a lattice pattern with the dough strips. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal. 8. Brush the top crust with beaten egg wash and sprinkle granulated sugar over it. 9. Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking. 10. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake it in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. 11. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing and serving.

ICT (Information and Communication Technology) refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications. In sports coaching, ICT is used to enhance training and performance, improve communication between coach and athlete, and facilitate the recording and analysis of data. One way ICT is used in sports coaching is through video analysis. Coaches can use video recording devices to capture footage of athletes during training or competitive events. This footage can then be analyzed using specialized software to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Video analysis can provide athletes with instant feedback, allowing them to make adjustments and fine-tune their techniques. ICT is also utilized in the collection and analysis of data. Athletes can use wearable devices such as fitness trackers or heart rate monitors to gather data on their performance and physiological responses. This data can be transferred to coaching software that can analyze the information and provide insights on areas such as fatigue levels, training intensity, and injury prevention. Coaches can then use this data to customize training programs and optimize performance. Communication between coach and athlete is greatly facilitated through ICT. Coaching software and mobile applications allow coaches to provide real-time feedback and instructions to athletes remotely. In addition, video conferencing platforms enable virtual coaching sessions where coaches can observe and guide athletes in real-time, regardless of their physical location. This is especially beneficial for athletes who are training away from their coaches or competing in international events. Overall, ICT in sports coaching provides valuable tools and resources that can enhance training and improve performance for athletes. By incorporating technology into coaching practices, coaches and athletes can access instant feedback, specialized analysis, and personalized guidance, leading to enhanced training strategies and optimized athletic performance."},{"instruction":"Mobtalker is a Visual Novel series created by AT-2verse and worked on by several others like Ken Redgrave, Flammarivla and Blackstargamer3, This series is primary an Ecchi (Sometimes Hentai) based on several series like Minecraft and Hyperdimension Neptunia…Later the novels were adapted into a Mod of the same name which is what more people are familiar with Most of the novels follow the same premise which is The Player under unknown circumstances finds himself in The Overworld or Minecraft itself where he forgets his origins and has to recover lost memories while meeting new Mobs along the way on top of discovering more about the very world around him and recovering his mysterious past.

Surrounding yourself with supportive and like-minded individuals can contribute to your personal growth and overall well-being. Consider exploring new avenues to meet people who share your interests and values. This could involve joining clubs, organizations, or online communities related to your hobbies or passions. Engaging in activities that align with your interests can help you connect with individuals who are more likely to engage in meaningful conversations and provide a positive social environment. Additionally, networking events, professional associations, or volunteering opportunities in areas you are passionate about can introduce you to people who may offer a greater intellectual and social connection. Remember, building new relationships takes time and effort. Be open to meeting new people, but also trust your instincts and prioritize surrounding yourself with individuals who positively contribute to your life. Lastly, seeking professional guidance from a therapist or counselor can provide valuable support during this transitional period. They can assist you in navigating social dynamics and offer strategies for building healthier and more fulfilling relationships. well guess i am quite young at 13, nobody at this age gonna be talking much smart anyway so im better off working on myself alone and people on the internet who actually have some smart shit to say It’s understandable that at a young age, finding individuals who engage in intellectually stimulating conversations can be more challenging. Focusing on personal growth and self-improvement during this time is indeed a valuable strategy. Building a strong foundation and working on yourself can lead to future opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals. Engaging with online communities, forums, or platforms that foster intellectual discussions can be a great way to interact with people who share similar interests and offer stimulating conversations. Participating in these spaces can provide exposure to diverse perspectives and ideas. Additionally, nurturing your own interests, pursuing hobbies, and investing time in personal development can help you develop a strong sense of self and attract individuals with similar passions and intellect in the future. It’s important to remember that meaningful connections can be formed at any age. As you continue to grow and explore the world, you will have more opportunities to meet individuals who share your intellectual curiosity and engage in deeper conversations. In the meantime, focusing on personal growth, expanding your knowledge through reading and learning, and connecting with others online who share similar interests can provide a fulfilling alternative for intellectual engagement. school starts when in estonia? and when does it end exactly In Estonia, the school year typically begins in early September and ends in late May or early June.

Here are a few key differences and potential advantages of an upper-lower split: 1. Increased training volume: With four training days instead of three, you can potentially increase your overall training volume. This can lead to greater muscle stimulation, which may translate into increased gains over time. 2. More targeted focus: With an upper-lower split, you can allocate specific training sessions to target different muscle groups. This allows for greater emphasis on each muscle group and the ability to incorporate a wider variety of exercises. 3. Enhanced recovery: By splitting your training days into specific upper-body and lower-body sessions, you allow for more focused recovery time for each muscle group. This can aid in muscle repair and growth. 4. Progressive overload: With an additional training day, you have more opportunities to progressively overload your muscles by increasing the weight lifted or the intensity of your exercises. Progressive overload is a key principle for muscle growth. That being said, the effectiveness of an upper-lower split depends on several factors, including your individual training goals, genetics, nutrition, rest, and overall consistency in your training program. Remember that everyone's body responds differently, and it may take time to see noticeable differences in gains. To maximize your progress, it's important to ensure proper form during exercises, adequate nutrition to support muscle growth, enough rest and recovery time, and a consistent and progressive training program. It may also be helpful to consult with a qualified fitness professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific goals and needs."},{"instruction":"estimate how long i should stay at 4 a week untill i can go up to 5?","output":"The timeline for progressing from a four-day per week training routine to a five-day per week routine can vary depending on individual factors such as your level of fitness, recovery ability, and overall training experience. However, it is generally recommended to spend a minimum of 4-6 weeks consistently following a training program before making significant changes or increasing frequency. During this initial period, focus on building a solid foundation, improving technique, and gradually increasing weights and intensity. Pay attention to how your body responds to the increased training load, and ensure that you are allowing for adequate recovery between sessions. After 4-6 weeks, assess how you feel both physically and mentally. If you are recovering well, making progress, and feeling ready for more frequent training, you can consider adding an additional training day. It is crucial to listen to your body and avoid rushing the process, as gradual and sustainable progress is key to long-term success. Remember that quality of training and recovery should always take precedence over quantity. If you find that you are struggling to recover adequately, experiencing excessive fatigue, or noticing a decline in performance, it may be better to stick with a four-day per week routine for a longer period before considering a transition to five days. As always, it's essential to consult with a qualified fitness professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific goals, abilities, and circumstances."},{"instruction":"ill do 3 months, that means ill be at 6 days a week which i dont think i wanna surpass just yet by early next year","output":"Transitioning to a six-day per week training routine within a three-month timeframe is an ambitious goal, but it's feasible with careful planning and consideration for recovery. It's important to prioritize proper rest, nutrition, and overall self-care to support your body's ability to adapt and recover from the increased training load. Here are a few tips to help you manage a six-day per week training routine effectively: 1. Gradual progression: Begin by slowly adding an extra training day per week and monitor how your body responds. If you find that your recovery is compromised or you're experiencing excessive fatigue, consider spacing out your training sessions or reducing the training volume until you adapt. 2. Intensity and volume balance: As the frequency of your training increases, be mindful of balancing the intensity and volume of your workouts. Avoid going overly heavy or pushing yourself to the limit in every session. Instead, alternate between higher-intensity and lower-intensity sessions to allow for recovery and optimize performance. 3. Active recovery days: Incorporate at least one or two active recovery days per week, where you engage in low-impact activities like light cardio, stretching, or mobility work. This can help reduce muscle soreness, promote blood flow, and aid in overall recovery. 4. Adequate rest and sleep: Prioritize quality sleep and allow for sufficient rest between training sessions. Aim for at least seven to eight hours of restful sleep each night to maximize recovery and support muscle growth. 5. Adjustments as needed: Be flexible and willing to adjust your training routine if needed. Everyone's body is unique, and what works for others may not work for you. Listen to your body's signals, pay attention to any signs of overtraining, and be willing to modify your routine accordingly. By carefully managing your training volume, intensity, and recovery strategies, you can adapt to and excel in a six-day per week training routine. Just remember to monitor your progress, make adjustments as necessary, and prioritize your overall well-being throughout the process."},{"instruction":"no i mean i do 3 months of 4 days and then 3 months of 5 untill doing 6","output":"I apologize for the confusion. If your goal is to progressively increase your training frequency, then following a plan of three months at four days per week and then three months at five days per week is a reasonable approach. By gradually adding an extra training day every three months, you allow your body time to adapt to the increased workload and minimize the risk of overtraining or burnout. This incremental progression can help you develop a consistent training habit and build a solid foundation of strength and conditioning. During each phase, focus on maintaining proper form, gradually increasing the intensity and volume of your workouts, and prioritizing recovery. Pay attention to your body and adjust the training variables as needed to ensure optimal progress while preventing injury. Remember to listen to your body and be flexible with your plan. If at any point you feel excessively fatigued, experience persistent soreness, or notice a decline in performance, it's essential to take a step back, evaluate your recovery strategies, and potentially modify your training program to ensure you're still progressing safely. Building up to a six-day per week training routine can be a long-term goal, and it's essential to prioritize quality over quantity throughout your journey. Consistency, proper technique, adequate recovery, and supporting your training with proper nutrition and sleep are key components to achieve sustainable progress. Consulting with a qualified fitness professional can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific goals and needs."},{"instruction":"what kind of split can be done at 6 a day","output":"When transitioning to a six-day per week training routine, it's important to utilize a split that allows for proper recovery and targets different muscle groups effectively. Here's an example of a possible six-day training split: Day 1: Chest and Triceps - Exercises: Bench press, incline dumbbell press, chest flyes, tricep dips, tricep pushdowns, overhead tricep extensions Day 2: Back and Biceps - Exercises: Deadlifts, bent-over rows, pull-ups, lat pulldowns, seated rows, bicep curls, hammer curls Day 3: Legs (Quadriceps and Hamstrings) - Exercises: Squats, lunges, leg presses, leg extensions, hamstring curls, Romanian deadlifts, calf raises Day 4: Shoulders and Abs - Exercises: Shoulder press, lateral raises, front raises, upright rows, reverse flyes, planks, Russian twists, cable crunches Day 5: Chest and Triceps - Exercises: Incline bench press, dumbbell flyes, push-ups, tricep dips, tricep pushdowns, skull crushers Day 6: Back and Biceps - Exercises: Rows (variations), pull-ups, lat pulldowns, bicep curls, hammer curls, chin-ups Remember to warm up properly before each workout and listen to your body during the training sessions.

While increasing training frequency can have potential benefits for muscle gains, it's important to note that a well-rounded approach that includes proper nutrition, adequate rest, and progressively challenging your body is crucial for achieving optimal results. Everyone's body responds differently, and it's possible to see variations in results based on individual factors. Personalized guidance from a qualified fitness professional who understands your specific goals and needs can provide more accurate insights and help tailor a training program to optimize your gains."},{"instruction":"give me an estimate in precentage. no matter how innacturate i just wanna get an idea","output":"While it's challenging to provide an accurate percentage estimate, increasing your training frequency from three days to six days per week may potentially result in a noticeable difference in gains. As a rough estimate, it's possible to see an improvement of around 10-20% in muscle growth and strength gains. However, it's important to keep in mind that these percentages are highly subjective and can vary greatly depending on individual factors such as genetics, training intensity, nutrition, recovery, and consistency. Some individuals may experience a higher rate of gains, while others may see less noticeable differences. Additionally, it's essential to prioritize proper form, progressive overload, and adequate recovery alongside increased training frequency. All of these factors contribute to achieving optimal gains in muscle growth and strength.

Интернет предоставляет уникальную возможность людям из разных стран и культур общаться и обмениваться информацией на единообразной основе. В этом контексте эсперанто может стать идеальным инструментом для коммуникации. Язык эсперанто обладает рядом преимуществ, которые могут способствовать его распространению в Интернете и за его пределами. Во-первых, эсперанто является легким и интуитивно понятным языком. Его грамматика отличается простотой, а слова строятся на основе международных корней. В связи с этим, изучение эсперанто не требует больших усилий и времени, что делает язык доступным для всех. Во-вторых, эсперанто пропагандирует идею равноправия всех людей и культур. Язык не привязан к какой-либо нации или региону и не дискриминирует ни одну из языковых групп. Вместо этого, эсперанто стремится объединить людей и сделать коммуникацию между ними легкой и безбарьерной. Третье преимущество эсперанто - его широкая сообщество и поддержка. В Интернете существуют множество форумов, социальных сетей, видеоуроков и других ресурсов, посвященных изучению и использованию эсперанто. Это сообщество становится все более активным и растущим, что способствует привлечению новых пользователей и распространению языка. Однако, несмотря на все эти перспективы, эсперанто пока не стал широко распространенным языком международного общения. Существующие языки, такие как английский, испанский и китайский, все еще являются более популярными и распространенными, особенно вне Интернета. Однако, со временем и с ростом популярности Интернета, шансы эсперанто стать более распространенным языком возрастают. Таким образом, в перспективе язык эсперанто имеет шанс стать популярным и распространенным языком международного общения, особенно в Интернете. Однако, это требует большего усилия и поддержки от сообщества и пользователей языка."},{"instruction":"Вероятность того, что один или несколько членов экипажа антарктической станции заражен пришельцем?","output":"Вероятность заражения члена экипажа антарктической станции пришельцем зависит от разных факторов, таких как наличие жизни на других планетах или внеземной формы жизни, вероятность контакта с ними и способ передачи инфекции. На данный момент нет надежных научных доказательств существования жизни на других планетах или внеземной формы жизни. В таком случае, вероятность заражения пришельцем на антарктической станции сейчас крайне низкая. Однако, в научно-фантастических сценариях предполагается возможность появления инопланетных форм жизни. Если принять такую гипотезу, вероятность заражения инопланетным организмом будет зависеть от механизма его передачи. Если инопланетный организм может передаваться воздушно-капельным путем или через прямой контакт, вероятность заражения будет выше. Однако, точные оценки этих вероятностей в сценарии инопланетной жизни являются чисто спекулятивными и не имеют научного обоснования. Таким образом, вероятность заражения члена экипажа антарктической станции пришельцем сегодня крайне низкая, учитывая отсутствие научных доказательств существования инопланетной жизни. В иной фантастической вселенной возможны другие сценарии, но они являются частью вымышленной литературы и кино, а не реальности."},{"instruction":"Проекция: Если организм \\"Нечто\\" из Антарктиды достигнет цивилизованных областей...","output":"Если предположить, что организм \\"Нечто\\" из фильма \\"Нечто\\" (The Thing) достигнет цивилизованных областей, это приведет к потенциальной угрозе для людей и окружающей среды. Для тех, кто не знаком с фильмом, \\"Нечто\\" - это внеземной организм, который способен заражать и копировать другие живые существа, принимая их облик. Он является крайне агрессивным и опасным, и его способность к мимикрии делает его очень трудно обнаружить. В таком случае, если \\"Нечто\\" достигнет цивилизованных областей, это может привести к нескольким возможным последствиям: 1. Распространение инфекции: \\"Нечто\\" может заражать людей и другие живые организмы, что может вызвать потенциальную эпидемию. Его способность к мимикрии также делает его трудным для идентификации и контроля. 2. Угроза безопасности: \\"Нечто\\" является высоко агрессивным и опасным организмом. Он может представлять угрозу для жизни и безопасности людей, а также для других животных и экосистем. 3. Каос и паника: Появление \\"Нечто\\" в цивилизованных областях может вызывать панику и хаос среди населения. Непредсказуемое поведение и способность \\"Нечто\\" к мимикрии могут создать ситуацию, в которой трудно доверять другим людям. Учитывая эти факторы, встреча с организмом \\"Нечто\\" в реальной жизни была бы крайне серьезной и опасной ситуацией, требующей немедленных мер предосторожности и научных исследований для защиты жизни и общества.

Однако, представим, что организм \\"Нечто\\" способен быстро размножаться и заражать новые хозяева. Земля обладает огромным разнообразием живых организмов, и время, необходимое для заражения каждого из них, может быть значительным. Кроме того, важно учитывать различия в биологии разных видов, так как организм \\"Нечто\\" должен быть совместим с генетикой и биологией других организмов, чтобы успешно их заразить и скопировать. Это делает задачу заражения всего живого на Земле еще более сложной. В целом, предположение о заражении всех живых организмов на Земле \\"Нечто\\" является концептуальным сценарием и представляет вымышленную ситуацию, не имеющую основания в реальности.

Она предполагает, что существует бесконечное количество вселенных, каждая из которых может иметь свои собственные физические законы и состояния. Однако, важно отметить, что эти теории являются гипотетическими и не имеют прямых научных доказательств. Параллельные миры и мультивселенные - это концептуальные модели, которые позволяют исследовать различные возможные варианты устройства вселенной и ее возможных вариантов существования. Научное сообщество продолжает исследовать эти идеи и проводить эксперименты, но для настоящего времени нет непосредственных доказательств или наблюдений, подтверждающих существование параллельных миров.

The term \\"springtime\\" is often used metaphorically to depict a period of renewal, growth, and awakening. Similarly, \\"nations\\" refers to various ethnic, cultural, and regional groups that sought political and national rights during this time. Thus, \\"The springtime of nations\\" signifies a period where people rose up and fought for their political and national aspirations, seeking to bring about change and transformation in their respective countries."},{"instruction":"What is meant by distinguishing between political and national rights in this context?","output":"In the context of the 1848 revolutions, distinguishing between political and national rights refers to the different types of demands and aspirations that were expressed by various groups and communities during this period. Political rights generally encompassed demands for greater political participation, representation, and democracy. Many individuals and groups sought reforms that would grant them the right to vote, establish representative governments, and institute constitutional and legal protections for individual liberties. The focus was often on obtaining political equality, aiming to challenge autocratic or oppressive regimes and establish more democratic systems. On the other hand, national rights centered around the aspirations of different ethnic, cultural, and regional communities for self-determination or national autonomy. These groups sought to assert their distinct identities, preserve their languages, cultures, and traditions, and secure some level of political and administrative autonomy within their regions or nations. National rights movements were often driven by desires for recognition, protection, and promotion of their unique cultural heritage, history, and collective identity. Both political and national rights were significant aspects of the 1848 revolutions, as various groups sought different forms of socio-political change and empowerment. The revolutions aimed to address both democratic deficits and national aspirations, although the specific demands and goals varied across different regions and nations involved in the upheavals."},{"instruction":"What national aspirations were addressed by the French revolution of 1848 within the terms you have set?","output":"The French Revolution of 1848 addressed several national aspirations within the context of political and national rights. France, like many other countries in Europe at the time, had various regional and cultural identities that sought recognition and autonomy. One of the key aspects of the French Revolution of 1848 was the demand for an elected constituent assembly. This reflected the political rights aspect of the revolution, where many people sought a more democratic and representative political system. The aim was to establish a government that would fairly represent the diverse interests and aspirations of the French population. Additionally, the French Revolution of 1848 saw the rise of nationalist sentiments. Certain regions within France, such as Brittany, Alsace, and Corsica, had distinct cultures and histories. They sought to assert their regional identities and preserve their cultural heritage. The revolution provided an opportunity to voice these national aspirations and seek greater recognition and autonomy for these regions within the framework of a united France. Furthermore, the French Revolution of 1848 also addressed social and economic grievances, particularly the demands for workers' rights and social justice. This was not necessarily a national aspiration in the sense of regional identity, but rather a broader societal demand for economic equality and better living conditions. The working class sought more rights and protections, including fair wages, improved working conditions, and the right to form unions. Overall, the French Revolution of 1848 encompassed a range of national aspirations, from demands for political representation and democracy to the recognition and preservation of regional cultures and identities. These aspirations were part of the broader quest for social, political, and economic justice during that time."},{"instruction":"What opportunities to voice national aspirations arose in relation to the French regions referred to in 1848? Please give specific examples, if possible.","output":"During the French Revolution of 1848, several opportunities arose for various regions within France to voice their national aspirations and demand recognition and autonomy. Here are some specific examples: 1. Alsace: The region of Alsace, which had a distinct cultural and linguistic identity, sought to assert its regional autonomy within France. In 1848, Alsatian representatives were elected to the National Assembly and actively advocated for the recognition of their region's specificities and the preservation of their Alsatian language and culture. 2. Corsica: Corsica, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, had a longstanding desire for greater self-governance and autonomy. During the French Revolution of 1848, Corsican representatives played a prominent role in the National Assembly. They pushed for measures to strengthen Corsica's regional authority and cultural identity, including the promotion of Corsican language and Corsican legal customs. 3. Brittany: Brittany, located in the northwest of France, had its distinct Celtic heritage and cultural traditions. During the 1848 revolution, Breton representatives also played an active role in the National Assembly. They sought to safeguard the Breton language, folklore, and customs, as well as advance regional autonomy and decision-making powers in matters affecting Brittany's affairs. These examples highlight how the 1848 revolution in France provided an opportunity for regions with distinct identities, such as Alsace, Corsica, and Brittany, to voice their national aspirations. The representatives from these regions actively participated in the democratic process, advocating for greater recognition, cultural preservation, and a level of autonomy within the framework of a united France."}]`),G={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const t=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return t?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(t)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(t)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],B={key:0},j={key:1};function O(t,e,l,m,n,r){const p=y("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",R,[(i(!0),o(w,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(i(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),o("div",P,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
