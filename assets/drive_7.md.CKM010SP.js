Washington and allies will only win war with legitimacy of policies and values. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The United States-led \\"war on terror\\" has been ongoing for 14 years since the tragic 9/11 attacks. While there have been successes in capturing and killing top terrorist leaders, the overall approach taken by Washington and its allies has a key flaw: hyper-militarization at the expense of soft power tools like public diplomacy. The focus on military power has certainly had an impact in striking a blow to terrorist networks, but it is not enough to win the war on terror. The legitimacy of policies and values must also be considered if the U.S. and its partners want to come out victorious. One of the most important tools that has been neglected in the war on terror is public diplomacy. This approach involves opening up communication channels to better understand and engage with foreign populations, promoting mutual understanding and building trust. Instead, the U.S. has relied heavily on military power to defeat terrorism, often at the expense of civilian lives and infrastructure. The focus on military operations has also led to a decline in the legitimacy of policies and values in the eyes of many around the world. Many people see America's actions as hypocritical - claiming to stand for freedom and democracy while violating human rights and using torture techniques. This has not only weakened America's position in the world, but it has also fueled anti-American sentiment and recruited more people to extremist causes. It is clear that the war on terror cannot be won through military means alone. Instead, soft power tools like public diplomacy must be employed to help build relationships and promote mutual understanding. This approach will help to improve the legitimacy of policies and values, making the fight against terrorism more effective. It is time for Washington and its allies to reassess their approach to the war on terror. The world needs a strategy that is focused on building relationships and promoting mutual understanding, not just military might. With the right balance of hard and soft power tools, the U.S. and its partners can succeed in the fight against terrorism while also fostering goodwill and trust around the world."},{"instruction":"Afghan Vote Count Stalled, Karzai Rival Ends Boycott KABUL (Reuters) Another top rival to Afghan election frontrunner President Hamid Karzai ended his boycott of the process on Wednesday, but vote counting was further delayed as a panel began to sift through dozens of complaints of fraud.

The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, proved to be that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland.

It was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene. This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe, with their albums Too Fast for Love (1981) and Shout at the Devil (1983) and, as the style grew, the arrival of bands such as Ratt, White Lion, Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot.

The nasty knocks exposed the dangers of profession combat sports. We have listed ten of the worst injuries that are still tough to watch. The Mail on Sunday's Concussion Campaign is helping raise awareness.","output":"Steven Taylor and Martin Skrtel sustained head injuries during a game on Sunday, bringing into the spotlight the inherent dangers of combat sports. As a result, we are reminded of the severity of such injuries, and the need for greater awareness surrounding concussion in professional sports. In light of this, we have compiled a list of ten of the worst injuries in sports, all of which are difficult to watch. The Mail on Sunday's Concussion Campaign is helping to shed light on the issue, raising awareness about the potential long-term impact of head injuries. As evidence suggests, repeated head injuries can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease that can have serious consequences for athletes later in life. Among the worst injuries ever witnessed in sports are those suffered by Kevin Ware, whose tibia snapped in half in a basketball game, and Anderson Silva, who suffered a leg break during an MMA fight. Meanwhile, gymnast Samir Ait Said's gruesome leg injury at the Rio Olympics caused gasps from the crowd, while skier Lindsey Vonn's knee injury during a downhill race was also painful to watch. Other notable injuries include Shaun Livingston's catastrophic knee injury during an NBA game, and Tonny Vilhena's horrendous leg injury during a football match. Skateboarder Jake Brown's vertebrae-shattering fall during the X Games, and BMX rider Taj Mihelich's horror crash are also high on the list of the worst sports injuries ever. In conclusion, Steven Taylor and Martin Skrtel's injuries are a timely reminder of the dangers of combat sports. While these sports can be thrilling to watch, they come with a significant risk of injury. The Mail on Sunday's Concussion Campaign is essential in raising awareness of the potential dangers and promoting safer sports practices, so that athletes can continue to perform at the highest level while minimizing the risk of serious injury."},{"instruction":"f The famous FWI women, inevitably wearing bright earrings and flashing colors, manage to be both graceful and sensuous as they walk., can we conclude that They are sensuous while being graceful in their walk.?

To achieve a healthy aquatic environment, it is important to regularly carry out several maintenance tasks. Test the water salinity (if applicable) and pH at least once per week to ensure that the water chemistry is within the recommended ranges for the species of fish and plants in the aquarium. This can be done using a water test kit that measures salinity, pH, and other parameters. Replace half the water monthly (with filter) or all of it weekly (no filter) to remove any accumulated waste, excess nutrients, and other harmful substances that can accumulate.

Clean the substrate surface with a kitty litter scoop every week to remove any uneaten food, dead plant matter, or fish waste that has settled on the bottom. This helps to prevent the buildup of harmful bacteria that can cause disease and other problems. Empty, clean, and refill the aquarium every 6-8 weeks or as needed. This involves removing all decorations and plants, draining the water completely, cleaning the glass and other components, and refilling with fresh water.

One way to do that is by listening to each note repeatedly. This means spending time hearing the subtle qualities of every pitch and taking note of its unique sound. As you become more familiar with each note, you can begin to ascribe other qualities to it. For example, you might find that one note sounds bright and cheerful, while another has a darker, more somber quality. These can be helpful associations as you work to bring more emotion and feeling into your playing. Another effective technique is to associate the note with another sound. This might mean thinking of a bird chirping, a car honking, or the sound of the ocean waves crashing on the shore. By making these connections, you can use your imagination to breathe life into each note, allowing it to come alive in your music. Finally, it's important to learn the variations of each note. Every pitch has multiple variations, depending on factors like tone, duration, and volume. By exploring these variations, you can develop a more nuanced understanding of each note, helping you to create richer, more expressive music. In conclusion, taking the time to listen to each note repeatedly, ascribing other qualities to it, associating it with other sounds, and learning its variations can be incredibly beneficial for any musician. By incorporating these techniques into your practice routine, you can develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of music, allowing you to create more meaningful and impactful compositions."},{"instruction":"Europe #39;s Ryder Cup team is having a reunion this week at Valderrama.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. For instance, if a transmitter delivers 100 W into an antenna having an efficiency of 80%, then the antenna will radiate 80 W as radio waves and produce 20 W of heat. In order to radiate 100 W of power, one would need to use a transmitter capable of supplying 125 W to the antenna. Note that antenna efficiency is a separate issue from impedance matching, which may also reduce the amount of power radiated using a given transmitter. If an SWR meter reads 150 W of incident power and 50 W of reflected power, that means that 100 W have actually been absorbed by the antenna (ignoring transmission line losses). How much of that power has actually been radiated cannot be directly determined through electrical measurements at (or before) the antenna terminals, but would require (for instance) careful measurement of field strength. Fortunately the loss resistance of antenna conductors such as aluminum rods can be calculated and the efficiency of an antenna using such materials predicted.

One of the most infamous short field goal misses occurred in the 1999 NFC Championship Game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Minnesota Vikings.

However, Andersen missed the kick wide left, sending the game into overtime.

The tragedy occurred in 2012 and Philpott had been collecting donations for the children's funerals. However, it was later revealed that he had requested the money be converted into Argos vouchers. Philpott's wife, Mairead, also caused controversy when she showed off her £80 trainers at a barbecue.

This can be done by right-clicking on the table, or by pressing the E key on PC (or the appropriate button on console versions of the game). The first item to craft is a brick slab. This can be made by placing three brick blocks in a horizontal row in the top row of the crafting menu. The resulting slab can be collected by dragging it to the inventory. Next, players will need to craft a set of brick stairs. To do this, they will need to use six brick blocks. The blocks should be arranged with two on the top row, three on the middle row, and one on the bottom row. This will create four sets of brick stairs, which can be collected and added to the inventory. Finally, players can craft a flower pot by using three bricks. The bricks should be arranged with one in the center slot, and one on either side in the bottom row of the crafting menu. This will create a flower pot, which can be collected and added to the inventory.

While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal's riffs often functioned as standalone melodies and had no swing in them. Heavy metal took on darker characteristics after Black Sabbath's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s. In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by hardcore punk, and which further differentiated the two styles. Despite this differentiation, hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side, with bands frequently standing on the boundary of, or crossing between, the genres.

Companies must comply with various laws and regulations to ensure a fair and transparent business environment. Two critical areas of the legal framework for business proceedings are equity sales and initial public offerings (IPOs). Equity sales involve the transfer of a company's ownership interest to investors in exchange for cash or other types of compensation. The sale of equity is regulated by securities laws that vary from state to state. Businesses must understand the legal requirements for equity sales in their states and comply with them to avoid penalties and legal consequences. One of the most significant equity sales is an initial public offering (IPO). This process involves a private company becoming a public company by offering shares of its stock to the public for the first time. Businesses must follow a rigorous legal process to complete an IPO. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the process to ensure transparency and fairness, and businesses must comply with its rules and regulations. In addition to equity sales and IPOs, businesses must also consider the judicial system for business proceedings. Some states have a specific court system for business disputes and proceedings. These courts have specialized judges and procedures to handle complex business issues effectively. Understanding the legal system in a state can help businesses navigate disputes and protect their legal rights. In conclusion, the legal framework for business proceedings is complex and requires businesses to understand and comply with various laws and regulations. Equity sales and IPOs are critical areas of the legal framework, and businesses must follow a rigorous process to comply with securities laws and regulations. Additionally, businesses must consider the judicial system for business proceedings in their states to protect their legal rights effectively.

It is also about taking responsibility for one’s life and making conscious choices that lead to a more fulfilling and happy life. One way to achieve this is through organization. Getting organized is an excellent way to gain a sense of control over one's life. Simple things like making a to-do list, scheduling appointments and setting reminders can help reduce stress and increase productivity. Being organized with finances, like creating a budget or paying bills on time, can also lead to financial stability and independence. Additionally, it is essential to spend some time on appearance. Taking care of oneself by dressing nicely, grooming, and maintaining cleanliness can boost self-confidence, self-worth, and even put others at ease when interacting. Along with that, getting enough sleep is essential since lack of sleep can cause negative impacts on mood, decision-making, and overall health. Developing positive relationships is another important aspect of being independent. Positive relationships can provide support and a sense of belonging, which can lead to a happier and successful life. Finding time to connect with loved ones or joining groups with shared interests can help develop these relationships. It is crucial to cut back on commitments that are unnecessary or do not bring any value to one's life. Saying no to obligations that cause stress or do not bring joy is a form of self-care and can help maintain focus on important goals. Moreover, having fun is necessary for a balanced life. Taking time for hobbies, trying new experiences or taking a break from work can reduce stress and improve overall wellbeing. In conclusion, being independent and leading a fulfilling life requires intentional and conscious choices that prioritize one's well-being. Getting organized, taking care of appearance, getting sleep, developing positive relationships, cutting back on commitments, and having fun are a few ways to increase self-care and pursue a happy life."},{"instruction":"Which is this about?

Whether it's a snippet of a conversation with an old friend or a moment of pure bliss on a summer day, memories are a window into our past and shape who we are today. That's why it's important to take a moment to pause and appreciate the first memory you come across. It may seem insignificant at first, but it could be the key to unlocking a treasure trove of cherished moments. Perhaps the memory you find is of a long-forgotten birthday party, or maybe it's a simple moment of contentment and peace while lying in a field of wildflowers. Whatever it may be, take the time to fully immerse yourself in it. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and allow the memory to wash over you. As you soak in the memory, you may find yourself feeling a sense of joy or even a twinge of sadness. It's important to experience all emotions that come up, as they each have their own value and can teach us lessons about ourselves. Once you've fully absorbed the memory, take a moment to reflect on it. What did it mean to you then, and what does it mean to you now? How has it shaped your life and your perspective? You may find yourself feeling grateful for the experience, or perhaps a newfound appreciation for the present moment. In any case, don't rush through the memory or dismiss it as insignificant. It may just hold the key to unlocking a rich tapestry of moments and experiences that have made you who you are today.

The exact number of prisoners exchanged is difficult to determine, as records from that time are incomplete and contradictory. According to some estimates, as many as 20,000 Finnish soldiers were captured by the Soviet Union during the Winter War of 1939-1940. Many of these soldiers were then transferred to camps in Germany after the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact in 1939. In 1941, when Germany launched its invasion of the Soviet Union, Finnish troops joined the attack on the Soviet Union's northern flank. During this time, several thousand Soviet prisoners were taken by Finnish forces. Later that year, Finland and Germany signed a bilateral agreement allowing for the exchange of prisoners between the two countries. The exact number of prisoners exchanged between Finland and Germany is unclear. Some sources estimate that around 10,000 Finnish prisoners were exchanged for an equivalent number of German prisoners. Other estimates suggest that the number of Finnish prisoners released by Germany was lower, perhaps around 6,000. It is also worth noting that the exchange of prisoners was not a one-time event, but rather occurred throughout the war. As such, the total number of Finnish prisoners released by Germany (and vice versa) likely varies depending on the timeframe examined.

Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way.

These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses.

One important aspect of hair care is selecting the right products for your hair type. Everyone's hair is unique, and finding the right products will help you achieve the best results. Make sure to choose hair care products that are specifically designed for your hair type. For example, if you have dry hair, choose a hydrating shampoo and conditioner. For oily hair, use a clarifying shampoo to remove excess oil. Static hair can be a nuisance, especially during colder months. If you experience extra static, try using an unscented dryer sheet and rubbing it over your hair. This will help control static and tame flyaways. Another quick fix for flyaway hair is using an ice cube. Simply run an ice cube over your hair to calm down flyaways and achieve a sleeker style. Dealing with frizz can be tricky, but using a small amount of non-greasy hand- or body-lotion can help. Simply apply a small amount of lotion to the palm of your hands, rub them together, and smooth over your hair. This will help control frizz and add shine to your locks.

At each interface, depending on the impedance match, some fraction of the wave's energy will reflect back to the source, forming a standing wave in the feed line. The ratio of maximum power to minimum power in the wave can be measured and is called the standing wave ratio (SWR). A SWR of 1:1 is ideal. A SWR of 1.5:1 is considered to be marginally acceptable in low power applications where power loss is more critical, although an SWR as high as 6:1 may still be usable with the right equipment. Minimizing impedance differences at each interface (impedance matching) will reduce SWR and maximize power transfer through each part of the antenna system.

Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earthbased telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989.

During his long career, Brees has thrown many touchdown passes, ranging from short ones that barely cross the goal line to long bombs that travel over 50 yards in the air. So how many more yards was Brees' longest touchdown pass than his shortest one? To answer this question, we need to look at Brees' career stats and determine the range of his touchdown passes. According to pro-football-reference.com, Brees has thrown 571 touchdown passes in his career as of the end of the 2020 season. His shortest touchdown pass was a 1-yard toss to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui in a game against the Detroit Lions on December 4, 2016. His longest touchdown pass was a 98-yard bomb to receiver Devery Henderson in a game against the Washington Redskins on November 15, 2009. So how many more yards was Brees' longest touchdown pass than his shortest one? The answer is 97 yards. This is because you simply subtract the yardage of the shortest touchdown pass (1 yard) from the yardage of the longest touchdown pass (98 yards), which gives you the difference of 97 yards. In conclusion, Drew Brees' longest touchdown pass was 97 yards more than his shortest touchdown pass.

Insiders in Abu Dhabi believe the deal will be confirmed soon.","output":"Peter Alliss, the iconic golf commentator, has recently expressed his sadness over the possibility of Sky taking over broadcasting rights of The Open from the BBC. According to Alliss, the BBC simply cannot compete with the massive spending power of Sky. Sky, the UK-based satellite television provider, is reportedly in talks to broadcast The Open, one of golf’s four major championships, starting in 2016. This news has sent shockwaves through the golfing world, with many fans and insiders expressing concern over the potential impact on the sport. Alliss, who has been a commentator for the BBC’s coverage of The Open for more than 50 years, spoke out about the issue in an interview with The Telegraph. “It’s sadness, really, that the BBC can’t compete money-wise,” he said. “That’s the way of the world, unfortunately. It’s the way everything is going, and the BBC can’t afford to compete with Sky.” The potential deal is said to be worth around £10 million per year, and many insiders in Abu Dhabi, where the negotiations are taking place, believe that it will be confirmed soon. This could mean that The Open will no longer be available to millions of viewers who rely on the BBC to broadcast the event. The impact of this potential change remains to be seen, but it is clear that many in the golfing community are worried about the future of the sport. Some have suggested that Sky’s coverage may be too commercialized and focused on the big names in the sport, rather than the more traditional elements that are celebrated by the BBC’s coverage. As golf continues to grow in popularity around the world, it seems likely that these kinds of debates about broadcasting rights and coverage will become more common.

The explosives were detonated simultaneously on a busy road, which was crowded with traffic and pedestrians, creating widespread devastation within the surrounding area. The Somali government has condemned the attack and has vowed to bring those responsible to justice. The incident is believed to have been the work of Islamist extremist groups who have long conducted an insurgency in the region, whose aim is to overthrow the government and impose their strict interpretation of Islamic law. The terrorist acts have been widely condemned by the international community, who have demanded an end to the violence and a return to stability within the country. The attack is another reminder of the ongoing turmoil in Somalia and the need for a comprehensive solution to end the violence that continues to devastate the lives of ordinary people. The government and international partners must work together to combat the insurgency and provide the necessary support to enable the country to rebuild and develop. In conclusion, the double car bombings near a hotel in Somalia have once again highlighted the need for concerted efforts toward security and stability in the country. While condemning these heinous acts, the people of Somalia hope that peace and stability will return soon, and the perpetrators of these crimes will be brought to justice."},{"instruction":"Nintendo seeks to dominate portable game market with new console (AFP) AFP Japanese video game giant Nintendo said it will seek to retain its dominance of the portable game market with the launch of wireless Nintendo DS, a handheld doublescreen console.

Knock the dirt off of each bulb with your hands. Trim away the roots with shears or scissors. Select a warm, dry location to dry your garlic out. Hang your garlic bulbs up or leave them out on the table. Wait 1014 days for your garlic to completely dry out.","output":"Garlic Harvesting and Drying Tips for Home Gardeners Harvesting garlic is a satisfying task for home gardeners who want to enjoy the fresh and pungent flavor of this beloved seasoning in their culinary creations. Garlic is ready to harvest after 6-8 months of growth, typically in late summer or early fall, when the lower leaves start to dry out and turn yellow or brown. At this stage, the bulbs have formed and matured, and the papery skin layers surrounding the cloves have begun to thicken. To harvest garlic, gently loosen the soil around each bulb with a digging fork or trowel, being careful not to damage the bulb or the stem. Then, pull the bulb out of the soil by grasping the stem near the base and lifting it up. You can also use a hoe or rake to remove the soil around multiple plants at once. Once you have harvested your garlic bulbs, it's time to prepare them for storage. Start by knocking off any large clumps of dirt with your hands or a soft brush, but avoid washing the bulbs, as exposure to water can increase the risk of mold and rot. Next, use a clean pair of shears or scissors to trim away the roots, leaving about ½ inch of stem attached to the bulb. After trimming the bulbs, choose a warm, dry location to dry them out for several weeks. You can either hang them up by their stems in a cool, airy place with good ventilation, or lay them out on a clean, dry surface like a table or wire rack. Make sure to avoid direct sunlight or high humidity, as these conditions can also lead to spoilage. Allow the garlic to dry for 10-14 days, or until the outer skin layers are dry and papery to the touch. You can test the dryness by gently squeezing one of the bulbs - if the skin feels papery and the cloves sound firm inside, they are ready for storage. Finally, store the garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place with good air circulation, such as a cupboard, pantry, or basement. Properly stored garlic can last for several months, providing a flavorful addition to your kitchen creations throughout the year."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: beach, bench, hill, overlook","output":"The beach has a bench overlooking the hill."},{"instruction":"A conjectural portrait is a portrait made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.

With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to decide which one is the best fit for you. However, by following some simple guidelines, you can make the selection process much easier. Firstly, you need to decide whether you want to track food, fitness or both. If you are primarily focused on improving your diet, then you may prefer an app that is designed for tracking your nutrition intake and helping you to make healthier choices. Alternatively, if you are more focused on your physical fitness, you may prefer an app that tracks your workouts and helps you to stay motivated. Once you have decided on your focus, it is important to consider finding an app with specialty items. Some apps are designed to cater to specific dietary needs, such as vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb diets. Others may have specialized workout routines or features, such as yoga or meditation programs. Choosing an app that caters to your specific needs and preferences can make your tracking experience much more enjoyable and effective. Another important factor to consider when choosing an app is to review ratings and reviews. Reading feedback from other users can help you gain insights into the app's usability, reliability, and effectiveness. Look for apps with high ratings and positive reviews, as these are more likely to provide a well-rounded tracking experience. Finally, it is important to determine a budget. While some apps may be free to download, others may require a subscription or a one-time purchase. By determining your budget upfront, you can narrow down your options and avoid overspending on an app that may not be the best fit for you. In conclusion, choosing the right app for tracking food, fitness or both can be a simple process if you follow these guidelines. By deciding on your focus, finding an app with specialty items, reviewing ratings and reviews, and determining your budget, you can select an app that will help you to achieve your goals and track your progress effectively."},{"instruction":"Check rates and availability for Outside Surf Hostel.

You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slowmotion lightning strike below. Question: What does lightning have to do with static electricity?

Previous hypotheses emphasized that photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms may have originated together in the earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting replicating DNA from high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation during the daytime. As a result, replication was relegated to the dark. However, evidence for this is lacking, since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm, the cyanobacteria, do the opposite of this they divide more in the daytime. Recent studies instead highlight the importance of coevolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.3 billion years ago. The current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt, and therefore counteract, damaging redox reactions on a daily basis.

Staff don't want a fight so will back down over mini bar 'discrepancies' The front desk is authorised to upgrade guests on special occasions. You'll get the worst room in the house if you booked through discount sites. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The hotel industry is notoriously competitive and can bring some surprises for those who are not in the know. To shed some light on the situation, former front desk employee Jacob Tomsky has come forward with some revelations. One of the most interesting insights shared by Tomsky is that the average hotel room costs just £25 a day to stay operational. This is something that should make hotel guests think twice about paying full price for a room. That being said, the costs of running a hotel can vary depending on its location, brand and target market. According to Tomsky, staff at hotels often don't want confrontation and will often back down over mini bar 'discrepancies'. This is particularly interesting given the exorbitant prices one can find in the mini bar. It's important for guests to be aware of this before making any purchase decisions. The front desk is also authorised to upgrade guests on special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. This may come as a surprise for some, but it's not uncommon for hotels to have a few premium rooms available to upgrade guests to as a goodwill gesture. If you're booking a room for a special occasion, it might be worth mentioning it at the front desk to see if they can do anything for you. Finally, if you've booked through discount sites, you might be getting the worst room in the house. Tomsky notes that hotels often reserve the smallest, least desirable rooms for those who book through third-party discount websites. This is something to keep in mind if you're not willing to take the risk. All in all, these insights into the hotel industry are eye-opening and should serve as a reminder to guests to be aware of what they're paying for. While some of these practices may seem underhanded, it's important to remember that hotels are in the business of making a profit, and guests should always try and get the most value for their money."},{"instruction":"Data: The Cambridge Blue eatType restaurant; The Cambridge Blue food English; The Cambridge Blue customer rating low What would a sentence about this data be like?","output":"The Cambridge Blue is a restaurant that serves mainly English food and has a low customer rating."},{"instruction":"The company asks federal regulators to approve the paperwork required for its stock sale.

These individuals may be further radicalized while behind bars, leading to them becoming more extreme in their beliefs and potentially carrying out violent acts once they are released. The potential consequences of this new wave of radicalization cannot be overlooked. It is clear that measures need to be put in place to prevent individuals from becoming radicalized while in prison. This could involve providing inmates with access to education and support programs that aim to counter extremist ideologies. It is also important to ensure that staff working in prisons are properly trained to identify signs of radicalization and extremism. This will enable them to take appropriate action and prevent radicalized individuals from spreading their beliefs to others. Ultimately, it is essential that the issue of prison radicalization is taken seriously.

A quick online search or asking a mutual acquaintance can help you get this information. Following the person's lead is also important. Pay attention to how they address you and the tone they use. If they are more formal, it's likely they expect a similar level of formality from you. On the other hand, if they are more casual, you can probably be more relaxed in your communication style. Ultimately, communicating effectively involves being flexible and adaptable to the situation at hand. By deciding on the appropriate level of formality, addressing the person by name, and following their lead, you can build strong relationships and create more productive conversations."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .

The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or twopart naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi. What book is still used for nomenclature?

To interpret planets, it is essential to know which house they occupy, ranging from the first to the twelfth house, each of which represents different aspects of an individual's life. The signs the planets are in offer additional information concerning the planet's influence and the mode of expression. There are twelve astrological signs in the zodiac, each of which corresponds with one of the four classical elements, fire, earth, air, and water.

Turkey opened its border to tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds fleeing the violence.","output":"Hundreds of Kurdish fighters from Turkey have joined a militia in an effort to stop the advance of ISIS militants near the town of Ayn-al-Arab, also known as Kobani. This move comes as ISIS has taken control of dozens of villages in the area, prompting a Kurdish activist to state that this is about defending the lives of 50,000 Kurds from a potential massacre. Turkey also opened its border to tens of thousands of Kurdish refugees fleeing the violence in the region. The situation in Kobani is particularly dire, and the involvement of Turkish Kurds in the fight against ISIS highlights the complex political and ethnic tensions in the region. For years, the Kurdish people have been fighting for autonomy and independence in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. While Turkey has been hesitant to assist the Kurds in their fight against ISIS, it has provided some support for Syrian Kurdish fighters in recent months. Despite this assistance, Turkey remains wary of the Kurdish fight for independence, as it fears that it will embolden the Kurdish population within its own borders. This complex political situation highlights the challenges of fighting against ISIS in the region, as alliances and allegiances shift in response to the changing political and military landscape. In the end, it remains to be seen whether the involvement of Turkish Kurds in the fight against ISIS will have any significant impact on the situation in Kobani. However, it is clear that the region remains a site of intense conflict and that the Kurdish people continue to face significant challenges in their struggle for autonomy and independence."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the use of smartphones as the primary mode of communication and entertainment among young adults.

President Barack Obama announced a series of changes aimed at improving U.S.Cuban relations on Wednesday.","output":"On Wednesday, President Barack Obama announced a series of changes aimed at improving the United States' relationship with Cuba. One of the changes includes the possibility of a presidential visit to the island nation. While the White House didn't confirm whether or not a visit would take place, the fact that it hasn't been ruled out marks a significant shift in diplomatic relations between the two countries. For decades, the U.S. and Cuba were at odds due to political ideology and tensions that arose during the Cold War. However, President Obama has been working to improve relations since 2014, when he announced plans to re-establish diplomatic ties with Cuba. Despite President Obama's efforts, there have been numerous obstacles hindering progress. One of the main challenges has been the U.S. embargo, which prevents American companies from doing business in Cuba. The embargo, which was first put in place in the 1960s, has had a significant impact on the Cuban economy. However, President Obama has been chipping away at the embargo by easing certain travel and business restrictions. President Obama has also called on Congress to lift the embargo entirely, citing the fact that it has not been effective in achieving its intended purpose. While there has been some pushback from lawmakers who believe that loosening the embargo will only strengthen the Castro regime, others believe that it is time to reevaluate U.S.-Cuban relations in the 21st century. The possibility of a presidential visit to Cuba is a clear indication that the U.S. is serious about improving relations with its island neighbor. While it remains to be seen whether or not a visit will actually take place, the fact that it is being considered is a promising sign. As diplomatic ties between the two countries continue to improve, it is likely that there will be further announcements and changes in the coming weeks and months. It will be interesting to see how these changes impact both the U.S. and Cuba, and what the future holds for these two countries."},{"instruction":"Write a positive movie review.","output":"The newly released movie \\"Soul\\" is absolutely exceptional.

It is a combination of an exhaustdriven turbocharger and an enginedriven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other. A beltdriven or shaftdriven supercharger offers exceptional response and lowrpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positivedisplacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twinscrew and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the lowrpm range the proper combination of the two can offer a zerolag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for smalldisplacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range.

The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well. Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well. But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable. For those who don't know, the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it great. The one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase. Where the original chase was very believable, the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes.
