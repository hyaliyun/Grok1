Azure Administrator Associate typically involves managing cloud services that span storage, security, networking, and compute cloud capabilities. Individuals in these roles are responsible for implementing, monitoring, and maintaining Microsoft Azure solutions, including major services related to compute, storage, network, and security. Azure Data Engineer, on the other hand, focuses on data-related tasks on the Azure platform. This includes managing and integrating data services, building and maintaining data processing systems, and ensuring that the data pipeline is scalable, efficient, and secure. This role is significant as data and analytics are a core part of business strategies and decision-making processes. In terms of market share or demand: - The Azure Administrator Associate role tends to be broadly in demand across industries because it covers the foundational aspects of Azure services. These skills are often required by businesses of all sizes that are moving to or already using the Azure cloud. - The Azure Data Engineer role can be highly specialized and is increasingly in demand due to the importance of data-driven decision-making, big data, and the need for sophisticated data services. This demand often grows in parallel with the increased need for analytics and business intelligence solutions. The tech industry is rapidly evolving, and so is the demand for specific skills. Several factors can influence the relative demand for Azure Administrators vs. Azure Data Engineers, including geographical location, industry type, the maturity of cloud adoption within the organization, and prevalent business challenges that require cloud-based solutions. It's important to note that job demand can also be influenced by trends in the industry, such as the rising importance of machine learning, AI, and the increase in remote work, which all have an impact on cloud services and data utilization. For the most current information about job demand for Azure Administrator Associates and Azure Data Engineer positions, it would be best to consult real-time job market data sources or reports that track IT job market trends. Consulting platforms like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, or specific IT job market reports can provide up-to-date insights into the demand for these roles."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…Natsuki’s STILL in the bathroom?

Ze is zo lang mogelijk thuis kunnen blijven. Na een verblijf van 2 weken in het ziekenhuis werd ze opgenomen in Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel. Ze is er een maand geweest. 30 jaar geleden stierf haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger. Drie kinderen zijn reeds overleden. Ze had vrede met het Woonzorgcentrum. Het eten was er goed. Schrijf een inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie. Hier is een voorbeeld van een andere uitvaart: Op de scharniermomenten van het leven zoeken en vinden mensen elkaar terug. Ook op een dag als vandaag, omwille van dit afscheid. Wat zover af leek, is nu plotseling heel dichtbij. Elke mens heeft zijn eigen verhaal elke mens heeft zijn eigen manier van rouwen en elke mens sterft zijn eigen dood. Leven, sterven, afscheid nemen, alles loslaten we doen het op onze eigen unieke manier het is een zeer eenzame bezigheid. Rond Jeanne zijn we hier samen om haar met eerbied te omringen, om dankbaar te gedenken wie zij was. Enerzijds kennen wij gevoelens van droefheid en verdriet omwille van Jeanne die ons ontvallen is, maar anderzijds is er ook dat gevoel van dankbaarheid om wat zij voor ons betekend heeft en wie zij voor ons is geweest. Jeanne heeft heel veel voor deze parochiegemeenschap gedaan. Ze was steeds bereid om anderen te helpen. Jeanne had een sterke persoonlijkheid en kon heel goed organiseren. Ze heeft steeds haar talenten ten volle benut. Om de naam van Jeanne als onvervangbaar in onze herinnering te bewaren, om de hoop die zij gekoesterd heeft als een fakkel door te geven, om de levenswijsheid van Jeanne aan mekaar door te geven. Wij vragen om vergeving. Schrijf ook een homilie. Dit is het evangelie: (Matteüs 11, 25-30) “In die tijd zei Jezus: “Ik loof U, Vader, Heer van hemel en aarde, omdat U deze dingen voor wijzen en verstandigen verborgen hebt gehouden, maar ze aan eenvoudige mensen hebt onthuld. Ja, Vader, zo hebt U het gewild. Alles is Mij toevertrouwd door mijn Vader, en niemand dan de Vader weet wie de Zoon is, en wie de Vader is, dat weet alleen de Zoon, en iedereen aan wie de Zoon het wil openbaren. Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven. Neem mijn juk op je en leer van Mij, want ik ben zachtmoedig en nederig van hart. Dan zullen jullie werkelijk rust vinden, want mijn juk is zacht en mijn last is licht.” Dit een voorbeeld van een homilie van een andere uitvaart: Iemand ontvalt ons… Dit zijn de ogenblikken dat we samen zitten als verslagen kinderen. Ontredderd, ontheemd, sprakeloos en kwetsbaar. Het is moeilijk om te begrijpen wat de dood is. Niet alleen als je klein bent, ook als je groot bent. Ooit zal een mens stoppen met leven. Soms merk je dat iemand niet lang meer zal leven. De dood kan snel komen. De ene dag is de mens er nog. De andere dag is hij weg. Door het overlijden van Paula er is wezenlijk iets veranderd. Bij het sterven van iemand gebeurt er iets essentieel. Paula Boomans werd geboren te Neder-Over-Heembeek op 2 februari van het jaar 1945. Als jong volwassen vrouw werd zij geconfronteerd met het overlijden van ouders en van haar broer. Tijdens die periode leerde ze Gilbert Willems, haar toekomstige echtgenoot kennen. Ze kregen twee fantastische kinderen: Karen en Peter. Paula heeft tot in het jaar 1978 in La Grande Ferme, haar ouderlijk huis in de Ransbeekstraat gewoond. Haar moeder hield er het café open en haar vader had er een houtzagerij en een transportbedrijf. Daarna verhuisde ze naar de Trassersweg. Paula werkte bij een farmaceutisch bedrijf dat gesloten werd. Daardoor werd Paula op vijftigjarige leeftijd verplicht op pensioen gesteld. Paula was een stille vrouw. Ze heeft haar echtgenoot steeds terzijde gestaan in de uitoefening van verschillende hobby’s. Zo waren er de activiteiten van het Davidsfonds, de volksdansgroep Lendrik en de muziekgroep Faro. Er was Blackstar. Paula ging mee naar de rolschaats activiteiten van haar dochter. Ze was een goede gastvrouw. Er waren ook de mooie momenten aan zee. Ze hield van haar kinderen en kleinkinderen. Ook de hond Bo nam een centrale plaats in het gezin in. Paula vierde de belangrijke momenten van haar jaar samen met familie. Ze gaf teveel snoepjes aan de kleinkinkinderen. Wat Paula ons gegeven heeft, blijft kostbaar en onuitwisbaar. Niemand neemt het van ons af. Zo heeft ooit een vertwijfeld volk - generaties lang - mensen die zich verloren voelden, die geen vrede vonden met wat ze om zich heen zagen gebeuren, tot God geroepen. En in dat dieptepunt werd hun een heel andere toekomst toegezegd: \\"Klamp je niet vast aan wat vroeger is gebeurd. Staar je niet blind op wat voorafging. Zie, iets nieuws ga Ik maken. Het is al aan het kiemen, weet jij dat niet? Ja, een weg zal Ik leggen door de woestijn… Ik geef water waar geen water is… Er gebeurt iets nieuws, het was al aan het kiemen, wij wisten het niet…” Maar niet dat verdriet zal onze herinnering onherroepelijk overschaduwen maar de herinnering aan de mens die zij is geweest. Alles wat zij gedaan heeft. Wie zij voor ons is geweest. In het bijbelfragment uit het Evangelie richt Jezus zich tot de vermoeide levenden. De kerngedachte luidt: ‘Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal Ik jullie rust geven.’ \\"Mijn juk is zacht ; zegt Jezus, “en mijn last is licht” Jezus neemt de lasten niet weg in een handomdraai. Let wel: het juk blijft en de lasten blijven eveneens. Ze worden draaglijk. Er valt mee te leven. De laatste veertien dagen stond de wereld van het gezin Willems-Bomans op zijn kop. Paula vernam dat zij een agressieve kanker had waar niets meer aan te doen was. Haar levensperspectief werd zeer kort. Omringd door haar dierbaren is Paula van ons heengegaan. Bedankt Paula voor alles wat je gedaan hebt, voor de mens die jij geweest bent, voor je onverwoestbare kern.","output":"# Inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie van Alma Samen komen wij hier, in dit huis van vrede en licht, omringd door de herinnering en de geest van Alma, een vrouw wier reis op aarde een weefsel was van liefde, verdriet, kracht en overgave.

Waar 30 jaar geleden de liefde van haar leven, Gaby De Saeger, haar verliet voor een onbekend hiernamaals, volgt zij hem nu, na een rijk en lang leven. Haar voetsporen, achtergelaten in het zand van de tijd, verhalen van de drie kinderen die haar vooruitgingen, herinneren ons aan de kracht van een moederhart dat zoveel te dragen had. In Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel vond Alma, na weken van strijd in de stilte van het ziekenhuis, een laatste thuis. Een plek waar haar dagen vervuld waren van zorg, en waar het eenvoudige genot van een goede maaltijd haar altijd dierbaar was. Vandaag zijn we bijeen om met respect terug te blikken op de stille getuigenis van haar leven, om met dankbaarheid haar onvervangbare aanwezigheid in onze levens te eren, om in tijden van verlies datgene te vieren wat onsterfelijk is door de vervlogen tijd: de essentie van Alma, die ons zal blijven verbinden met haar verhaal, haar nalatenschap en haar liefde. We komen samen in rouw, maar ook in dankbaarheid, herinnerend aan alles wat Alma voor ons heeft betekend en wie zij voor ons is geweest. Met een hart vol herinnering benaderen wij de stilte die zij achterlaat, met de hoop dat precies zoals zij ons heeft geleerd, wij haar rust en kalmte mogen vinden op ons eigen pad van verdriet en acceptatie. # Homilie Met gebogen hoofden en verzwaarde harten zijn we hier verzameld in de afwezigheid van Alma, wiens tijdelijke afscheid ons doet stilstaan bij de kwetsbaarheid van ons eigen bestaan. Net als de bladeren die met de seizoenen meedraaien, heeft ook Alma haar laatste bladzijde omgedraaid in de oneindige kroniek van het leven. Alma's verhaal werd gekenmerkt door veerkracht, door de eenvoud en de overgave aan de loop van het leven zelf. In een wereld die constant verandert, bleef zij een baken van standvastigheid, een toonbeeld van de 'eenvoudige mensen' waarover Jezus spreekt in het evangelie volgens Matteüs. In haar bescheidenheid schuilt een rijkdom die voor wijzen en verstandigen soms verborgen blijft, maar door harten als dat van Alma helder wordt onthuld. Zoals Jezus zijn juk aanbiedt, een juk dat zacht is en een last die licht is, zo droeg ook Alma haar eigen lasten met opmerkelijke zachtmoedigheid. Zij leefde in zachtmoedigheid en bood in haar eigen manier rust aan degenen die vermoeid en beladen waren. Haar nalatenschap is een leven dat, al was het besprenkeld met verdriet, altijd het licht van liefde en medeleven uitstraalde. Nu Alma's levenspad zijn aardse einde heeft bereikt, is het aan ons om de levenswijsheid die zij deelde door te geven, de fakkel van vertrouwen en liefde te dragen en verder aan te steken in de nacht van onze wereld. Haar leven dient als een gids, een fluistering in ons oor dat ook in donkere tijden de zon weer zal rijzen. We houden vast aan de woorden van het Evangelie, waar Jezus ons uitnodigt om naar Hem toe te komen voor rust. Terwijl wij ons verdriet proberen te omarmen, mogen we troost vinden in het idee dat Alma die eeuwige rust gevonden heeft, bevrijd van elke aardse last, genesteld in de omarming van de oneindige liefde. Laten we de herinnering aan Alma koesteren, niet alleen door de spijt van haar heengaan maar juist door de levendigheid van haar geest, door wat zij ons gegeven heeft, wat onuitwisbaar en kostbaar blijft; niemand kan dat van ons ontnemen. Zoals Alma ons leidde met haar verstilling en kracht, mogen we nu, zelfs in onze diepste wanhoop, vertrouwen op het kiemen van nieuwe wegen, nieuwe liefde, en nieuwe hoop. Vandaag nemen we afscheid, maar in ons hart weerklinkt Alma's echo voort – een symfonie van leven en liefde die voor altijd zal resoneren in de stilte die ze achterlaat. Bedankt, Alma, voor elke stap, voor elk woord, voor de liefde en de wijsheid die je als een onverwoestbare kern in ons hebt geplant. Amen."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…Natsuki’s STILL in the bathroom?

Schrijf een inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie. Hier is een voorbeeld van een andere uitvaart: Op de scharniermomenten van het leven zoeken en vinden mensen elkaar terug. Ook op een dag als vandaag, omwille van dit afscheid. Wat zover af leek, is nu plotseling heel dichtbij. Elke mens heeft zijn eigen verhaal elke mens heeft zijn eigen manier van rouwen en elke mens sterft zijn eigen dood. Leven, sterven, afscheid nemen, alles loslaten we doen het op onze eigen unieke manier het is een zeer eenzame bezigheid. Rond Jeanne zijn we hier samen om haar met eerbied te omringen, om dankbaar te gedenken wie zij was. Enerzijds kennen wij gevoelens van droefheid en verdriet omwille van Jeanne die ons ontvallen is, maar anderzijds is er ook dat gevoel van dankbaarheid om wat zij voor ons betekend heeft en wie zij voor ons is geweest. Jeanne heeft heel veel voor deze parochiegemeenschap gedaan. Ze was steeds bereid om anderen te helpen. Jeanne had een sterke persoonlijkheid en kon heel goed organiseren. Ze heeft steeds haar talenten ten volle benut. Om de naam van Jeanne als onvervangbaar in onze herinnering te bewaren, om de hoop die zij gekoesterd heeft als een fakkel door te geven, om de levenswijsheid van Jeanne aan mekaar door te geven. Wij vragen om vergeving. Schrijf ook een homilie. Dit is het evangelie: (Matteüs 11, 25-30) “In die tijd zei Jezus: “Ik loof U, Vader, Heer van hemel en aarde, omdat U deze dingen voor wijzen en verstandigen verborgen hebt gehouden, maar ze aan eenvoudige mensen hebt onthuld. Ja, Vader, zo hebt U het gewild. Alles is Mij toevertrouwd door mijn Vader, en niemand dan de Vader weet wie de Zoon is, en wie de Vader is, dat weet alleen de Zoon, en iedereen aan wie de Zoon het wil openbaren. Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven. Neem mijn juk op je en leer van Mij, want ik ben zachtmoedig en nederig van hart. Dan zullen jullie werkelijk rust vinden, want mijn juk is zacht en mijn last is licht.” Dit een voorbeeld van een homilie van een andere uitvaart: Iemand ontvalt ons… Dit zijn de ogenblikken dat we samen zitten als verslagen kinderen. Ontredderd, ontheemd, sprakeloos en kwetsbaar. Het is moeilijk om te begrijpen wat de dood is. Niet alleen als je klein bent, ook als je groot bent. Ooit zal een mens stoppen met leven. Soms merk je dat iemand niet lang meer zal leven. De dood kan snel komen. De ene dag is de mens er nog. De andere dag is hij weg. Door het overlijden van Paula er is wezenlijk iets veranderd. Bij het sterven van iemand gebeurt er iets essentieel. Paula Boomans werd geboren te Neder-Over-Heembeek op 2 februari van het jaar 1945. Als jong volwassen vrouw werd zij geconfronteerd met het overlijden van ouders en van haar broer. Tijdens die periode leerde ze Gilbert Willems, haar toekomstige echtgenoot kennen. Ze kregen twee fantastische kinderen: Karen en Peter. Paula heeft tot in het jaar 1978 in La Grande Ferme, haar ouderlijk huis in de Ransbeekstraat gewoond. Haar moeder hield er het café open en haar vader had er een houtzagerij en een transportbedrijf. Daarna verhuisde ze naar de Trassersweg. Paula werkte bij een farmaceutisch bedrijf dat gesloten werd. Daardoor werd Paula op vijftigjarige leeftijd verplicht op pensioen gesteld. Paula was een stille vrouw. Ze heeft haar echtgenoot steeds terzijde gestaan in de uitoefening van verschillende hobby’s. Zo waren er de activiteiten van het Davidsfonds, de volksdansgroep Lendrik en de muziekgroep Faro. Er was Blackstar. Paula ging mee naar de rolschaats activiteiten van haar dochter. Ze was een goede gastvrouw. Er waren ook de mooie momenten aan zee. Ze hield van haar kinderen en kleinkinderen. Ook de hond Bo nam een centrale plaats in het gezin in. Paula vierde de belangrijke momenten van haar jaar samen met familie. Ze gaf teveel snoepjes aan de kleinkinkinderen. Wat Paula ons gegeven heeft, blijft kostbaar en onuitwisbaar. Niemand neemt het van ons af. Zo heeft ooit een vertwijfeld volk - generaties lang - mensen die zich verloren voelden, die geen vrede vonden met wat ze om zich heen zagen gebeuren, tot God geroepen. En in dat dieptepunt werd hun een heel andere toekomst toegezegd: \\"Klamp je niet vast aan wat vroeger is gebeurd. Staar je niet blind op wat voorafging. Zie, iets nieuws ga Ik maken. Het is al aan het kiemen, weet jij dat niet? Ja, een weg zal Ik leggen door de woestijn… Ik geef water waar geen water is… Er gebeurt iets nieuws, het was al aan het kiemen, wij wisten het niet…” Maar niet dat verdriet zal onze herinnering onherroepelijk overschaduwen maar de herinnering aan de mens die zij is geweest. Alles wat zij gedaan heeft. Wie zij voor ons is geweest. In het bijbelfragment uit het Evangelie richt Jezus zich tot de vermoeide levenden. De kerngedachte luidt: ‘Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal Ik jullie rust geven.’ \\"Mijn juk is zacht ; zegt Jezus, “en mijn last is licht” Jezus neemt de lasten niet weg in een handomdraai. Let wel: het juk blijft en de lasten blijven eveneens. Ze worden draaglijk. Er valt mee te leven. De laatste veertien dagen stond de wereld van het gezin Willems-Bomans op zijn kop. Paula vernam dat zij een agressieve kanker had waar niets meer aan te doen was. Haar levensperspectief werd zeer kort. Omringd door haar dierbaren is Paula van ons heengegaan. Bedankt Paula voor alles wat je gedaan hebt, voor de mens die jij geweest bent, voor je onverwoestbare kern.","output":"Beste vrienden en familieleden, Vandaag zijn we hier samen om afscheid te nemen van Alma, een vrouw met een uitzonderlijk lang en rijk leven. Ze werd geboren op 18 mei 1926 en kon zo lang mogelijk thuis blijven voordat ze twee weken in het ziekenhuis verbleef en daarna een maand in Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel. Ze had vrede met deze overgang en genoot van het goede eten daar. Alma heeft in haar leven veel meegemaakt, waaronder het verlies van haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger, evenals het overlijden van drie van haar kinderen. Ondanks deze tragische gebeurtenissen heeft Alma altijd haar sterke persoonlijkheid behouden en heeft ze haar talenten ten volle benut. Ze stond altijd klaar om anderen te helpen en haar organisatievaardigheden waren bewonderenswaardig. Nu zijn we hier samen, om Alma met eerbied te omringen, om haar te herinneren en te danken voor wie ze was. We voelen verdriet en droefheid om haar verlies, maar ook dankbaarheid voor wat ze voor ons heeft betekend. Door elkaar te steunen en haar naam in onze herinnering te bewaren, kunnen we haar hoop en levenswijsheid aan elkaar doorgeven. Laten we vandaag samen zijn, om Alma te eren en te gedenken, en elkaar te steunen in ons rouwproces. Laten we om vergeving vragen en de mooie herinneringen aan Alma koesteren. We zijn dankbaar dat ze deel uitmaakte van onze levens en zullen haar onvergetelijk maken in onze harten. Laten we nu luisteren naar het Woord van God, dat ons helpt om hoop en troost te vinden in deze moeilijke tijd. *Pauzeer voor een moment van stilte en reflectie* --Homilie-- Dierbare vrienden en familieleden, Op dit moment van afscheid en rouw, zijn we hier samen als verslagen kinderen. De dood van een geliefde, zoals in het geval van Paula Boomans, verandert ons wezenlijk. Het is moeilijk om te begrijpen wat de dood precies is, ongeacht onze leeftijd. Het ene moment is iemand er, het volgende moment is hij of zij weg. Paula werd geboren op 2 februari 1945 en heeft in haar leven veel verlies meegemaakt. Ze heeft haar ouders en broer verloren, en heeft samen met haar man Gilbert Willems twee fantastische kinderen gekregen, Karen en Peter. Paula was een stille vrouw, maar stond altijd aan de zijde van haar echtgenoot in zijn verschillende hobby's en activiteiten. Ze hield van haar kinderen, kleinkinderen en haar hond Bo. Paula heeft ons veel gegeven, en deze geschenken blijven kostbaar en onuitwisbaar. Wat ze ons heeft nagelaten, niemand kan het ons ontnemen. In tijden van verdriet hebben mensen altijd tot God geroepen, en werd hen een heel andere toekomst beloofd. Een toekomst waarin iets nieuws wordt gecreëerd, waarin wegen worden gelegd door de woestijn en water wordt gegeven waar geen water is. Hoewel we verdriet voelen over het verlies van Paula, is het belangrijk om niet alleen het verdriet te herinneren, maar vooral de persoon die ze was en de positieve impact die ze op ons leven heeft gehad. Laten we haar herinneren als de zorgzame en liefdevolle persoon die ze was, en laten we haar onverwoestbare kern koesteren. In het evangelie van Matteüs spreekt Jezus tot de vermoeide levenden en biedt hij rust aan degenen die gebukt gaan onder lasten. Hij biedt geen directe verlichting, maar een manier om draaglijkheid te vinden in het leven. Paula heeft de laatste veertien dagen van haar leven omringd door haar dierbaren doorgebracht, nadat ze te horen kreeg dat ze een agressieve kanker had. Laten we vandaag dankbaar zijn voor alles wat Paula heeft gedaan, voor de persoon die ze is geweest en voor haar onvermoeibare kern. Laten we ons samen herinneren en onze steun aan elkaar aanbieden terwijl we dit moment van afscheid en rouw delen. Laten we nu onze gedachten en gebeden richten tot God, en Hem vragen om ons troost en kracht te geven in deze moeilijke tijd. *Einde van de homilie*"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…Natsuki’s STILL in the bathroom?

En in dat dieptepunt werd hun een heel andere toekomst toegezegd: \\"Klamp je niet vast aan wat vroeger is gebeurd. Staar je niet blind op wat voorafging. Zie, iets nieuws ga Ik maken. Het is al aan het kiemen, weet jij dat niet? Ja, een weg zal Ik leggen door de woestijn… Ik geef water waar geen water is… Er gebeurt iets nieuws, het was al aan het kiemen, wij wisten het niet…” Maar niet dat verdriet zal onze herinnering onherroepelijk overschaduwen maar de herinnering aan de mens die zij is geweest. Alles wat zij gedaan heeft. Wie zij voor ons is geweest. In het bijbelfragment uit het Evangelie richt Jezus zich tot de vermoeide levenden. De kerngedachte luidt: ‘Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal Ik jullie rust geven.’ \\"Mijn juk is zacht ; zegt Jezus, “en mijn last is licht” Jezus neemt de lasten niet weg in een handomdraai. Let wel: het juk blijft en de lasten blijven eveneens. Ze worden draaglijk. Er valt mee te leven. De laatste veertien dagen stond de wereld van het gezin Willems-Bomans op zijn kop. Paula vernam dat zij een agressieve kanker had waar niets meer aan te doen was. Haar levensperspectief werd zeer kort. Omringd door haar dierbaren is Paula van ons heengegaan. Bedankt Paula voor alles wat je gedaan hebt, voor de mens die jij geweest bent, voor je onverwoestbare kern.","output":"**Inleiding Uitvaartliturgie:** Geliefden, Wij zijn hier samen in een kring van troost en herinnering, verenigd om afscheid te nemen van Alma, een vrouw die het weefsel van een lang en vol leven heeft achtergelaten. Alma werd geboren op een lentedag van 18 mei 1926, ze heeft de seizoenen van het leven in volle omvang meegemaakt en wist liefde en veerkracht te vinden in de eenvoud van haar bestaan. Haar pad heeft vreugde en verdriet gekend, waaronder het verlies van haar geliefde Gaby en dat van drie van haar kinderen, maar ook momenten van geluk en tevredenheid. In Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel vond Alma rust na een periode van zorg. Het werd een plaats waar haar laatste dagen comfortabel en met eerbied voor haar persoon gewaarborgd waren. Het eten, de zorg, de kleine dagelijkse dingen - ze boden haar een gevoel van vrede die ze heeft omarmd in harmonie met haar levensavond. Met respect voor haar leven en alles wat Alma voor ons is geweest, verzamelen wij hier om haar te gedenken. Thea, lief en vertrouwd, wiens aanwezigheid ons bijbleef, ook in de eindigheid van haar tijd. Vandaag eren wij haar met een stilte die spreekt van dankbaarheid, met woorden die trachten de diepte van gevoelens te raken, en met rituelen die de verbintenis uitdrukken welke de dood overstijgen kan. Laat ons Alma's reis gedenken, haar liefde, haar wijsheid; laat ons vandaag met elkaar en met haar de momenten koesteren die ons dierbaar zijn. In deze viering van afscheid en herinnering, reflecteren wij ook op onszelf, op de broosheid van het leven en de ongrijpbare kracht van de liefde. **Homilie:** Broeders en zusters in geloof en verbondenheid, We zijn vandaag hier, samengetrokken onder de vleugels van hoop en troost die ons geloof ons biedt, om met een dankbaar hart te reflecteren op het leven van onze geliefde Alma. Het Evangelie volgens Matteüs herinnert ons aan de zachtheid en de eenvoud waarin God zich aan ons toont. Het is niet de luidruchtigheid van de wereld, noch de complexiteit van het bestaan dat ons dichter bij Hem brengt, maar de stille aanvaarding en het eenvoudige geloof. Alma, die zoveel seizoenen doorlopen heeft, heeft wellicht in haar stilte en eenvoud de aanwezigheid van God ervaren in haar dagelijkse bestaan - in de warme zonnestralen die haar gezicht streelden, in de liefde en zorg van degenen om haar heen, en in haar onwankelbare verbondenheid met Gaby en haar kinderen over tijd en ruimte heen. Jezus spreekt tot ons: \\"Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven.\\" Dit is een uitnodiging aan Alma geweest, een belofte die zij aan het einde van haar aardse reis mocht aanvaarden. Haar kracht en zachtheid, tekenend voor haar leven, weerspiegelen de nederigheid en de zachtmoedigheid die Jezus in het evangelie predikt. Ze droeg haar lasten met gratie, en nu mag ze rust vinden in de grenzeloze goedheid van onze Schepper. We herinneren ons Alma niet in verdriet, maar in de blijvende nalatenschap van haar liefde en levenswijsheden. We accepteren dat de cyclus van een mensenleven zoals het hare een loop heeft van komen en gaan, van geven en ontvangen, en uiteindelijk van terugkeren naar waar we allemaal vandaan komen. Laten we in deze viering dan ook troost zoeken in de woorden van Jezus - dat ons juk zacht mag zijn en onze last licht. Dat we, net als Alma, moed en vrede mogen vinden in het hart van ons geloof en dat ons samenzijn van vandaag ons sterkt in het besef dat liefde en herinnering geen afscheid kennen. Moge Alma nu in vrede rusten, mogen we haar gedachtenis koesteren, en moge de les van haar leven ons inspireren tot zachtheid, liefde en een diep vertrouwen in de goedheid die ons voorbij de wereldse lasten draagt. Amen."},{"instruction":"I will give you a big amout od content, which is from a pdf files for my study material. I want you to make a list of all the topics of it have.","output":"Great!

Process Modeling 4.1. Introduction to Process Modeling 4.1.4. What are some of the different statistical methods for model building? 4.1.4.1. Linear Least Squares Regression Modeling Workhorse Linear least squares regression is by far the most widely used modeling method. It is what most people mean when they say they have used \\"regression\\", \\"linear regression\\" or \\"least squares\\" to fit a model to their data. Not only is linear least squares regression the most widely used modeling method, but it has been adapted to a broad range of situations that are outside its direct scope. It plays a strong underlying role in many other modeling methods, including the other methods discussed in this section: nonlinear least squares regression, weighted least squares regression and LOESS. Definition of a Linear Least Squares Model Used directly, with an appropriate data set, linear least squares regression can be used to fit the data with any function of the form in which 1. each explanatory variable in the function is multiplied by an unknown parameter, 2. there is at most one unknown parameter with no corresponding explanatory variable, and 3. all of the individual terms are summed to produce the final function value. In statistical terms, any function that meets these criteria would be called a \\"linear function\\". The term \\"linear\\" is used, even though the function may not be a straight line, because if the unknown parameters are considered to be variables and the explanatory variables are considered to be known coefficients corresponding to those \\"variables\\", then the problem becomes a system (usually overdetermined) of linear equations that can be solved for the values of the unknown parameters. To differentiate the various meanings of the word \\"linear\\", the linear models being discussed here are often said to be \\"linear in the parameters\\" or \\"statistically linear\\". Why \\"Least Squares\\"? Linear least squares regression also gets its name from the way the estimates of the unknown parameters are computed. The \\"method of least squares\\" that is used to f(x;⃗ β) ⃗ = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + … obtain parameter estimates was independently developed in the late 1700's and the early 1800's by the mathematicians Karl Friedrich Gauss, Adrien Marie Legendre and (possibly) Robert Adrain [Stigler (1978)] [Harter (1983)] [Stigler (1986)] working in Germany, France and America, respectively. In the least squares method the unknown parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations between the data and the model. The minimization process reduces the overdetermined system of equations formed by the data to a sensible system of , (where is the number of parameters in the functional part of the model) equations in unknowns. This new system of equations is then solved to obtain the parameter estimates. To learn more about how the method of least squares is used to estimate the parameters, see Section 4.4.3.1. Examples of Linear Functions As just mentioned above, linear models are not limited to being straight lines or planes, but include a fairly wide range of shapes. For example, a simple quadratic curve, is linear in the statistical sense. A straight-line model in , or a polynomial in , is also linear in the statistical sense because they are linear in the parameters, though not with respect to the observed explanatory variable, . Nonlinear Model Example Just as models that are linear in the statistical sense do not have to be linear with respect to the explanatory variables, nonlinear models can be linear with respect to the explanatory variables, but not with respect to the parameters. For example, is linear in , but it cannot be written in the general form of a linear model presented above. This is because the slope of this line is expressed as the product of two parameters. As a result, nonlinear least squares regression could be used to fit this model, but linear least squares cannot be used. For further examples and discussion of nonlinear models see the next section, Section 4.1.4.2. Advantages of Linear Least Squares Linear least squares regression has earned its place as the primary tool for process modeling because of its effectiveness and completeness. p p p f(x; β) = + x + , ⃗ β0 β1 β11x 2 log(x) f(x; β) = + ln(x), ⃗ β0 β1 sin(x) f(x; β) = + sin(x) + sin(2x) + sin(3x), ⃗ β0 β1 β2 β3 x f(x; β) = + x ⃗ β0 β0β1 x Though there are types of data that are better described by functions that are nonlinear in the parameters, many processes in science and engineering are well-described by linear models. This is because either the processes are inherently linear or because, over short ranges, any process can be well-approximated by a linear model. The estimates of the unknown parameters obtained from linear least squares regression are the optimal estimates from a broad class of possible parameter estimates under the usual assumptions used for process modeling. Practically speaking, linear least squares regression makes very efficient use of the data. Good results can be obtained with relatively small data sets. Finally, the theory associated with linear regression is wellunderstood and allows for construction of different types of easily-interpretable statistical intervals for predictions, calibrations, and optimizations. These statistical intervals can then be used to give clear answers to scientific and engineering questions. Disadvantages of Linear Least Squares The main disadvantages of linear least squares are limitations in the shapes that linear models can assume over long ranges, possibly poor extrapolation properties, and sensitivity to outliers. Linear models with nonlinear terms in the predictor variables curve relatively slowly, so for inherently nonlinear processes it becomes increasingly difficult to find a linear model that fits the data well as the range of the data increases. As the explanatory variables become extreme, the output of the linear model will also always more extreme. This means that linear models may not be effective for extrapolating the results of a process for which data cannot be collected in the region of interest. Of course extrapolation is potentially dangerous regardless of the model type. Finally, while the method of least squares often gives optimal estimates of the unknown parameters, it is very sensitive to the presence of unusual data points in the data used to fit a model. One or two outliers can sometimes seriously skew the results of a least squares analysis. This makes model validation, especially with respect to outliers, critical to obtaining sound answers to the questions motivating the construction of the model. 4. Process Modeling 4.1. Introduction to Process Modeling 4.1.4. What are some of the different statistical methods for model building? 4.1.4.2. Nonlinear Least Squares Regression Extension of Linear Least Squares Regression Nonlinear least squares regression extends linear least squares regression for use with a much larger and more general class of functions. Almost any function that can be written in closed form can be incorporated in a nonlinear regression model. Unlike linear regression, there are very few limitations on the way parameters can be used in the functional part of a nonlinear regression model. The way in which the unknown parameters in the function are estimated, however, is conceptually the same as it is in linear least squares regression. Definition of a Nonlinear Regression Model As the name suggests, a nonlinear model is any model of the basic form, in which 1. the functional part of the model is not linear with respect to the unknown parameters, , and 2. the method of least squares is used to estimate the values of the unknown parameters. Due to the way in which the unknown parameters of the function are usually estimated, however, it is often much easier to work with models that meet two additional criteria: 3. the function is smooth with respect to the unknown parameters, and 4. the least squares criterion that is used to obtain the parameter estimates has a unique solution. These last two criteria are not essential parts of the definition of a nonlinear least squares model, but are of practical importance. Examples of Nonlinear Models Some examples of nonlinear models include: y = f(x;⃗ β) + ε , ⃗ β0, β1, … f(x; β) ⃗ = β0 + β1x 1 + β2x Advantages of Nonlinear Least Squares The biggest advantage of nonlinear least squares regression over many other techniques is the broad range of functions that can be fit. Although many scientific and engineering processes can be described well using linear models, or other relatively simple types of models, there are many other processes that are inherently nonlinear. For example, the strengthening of concrete as it cures is a nonlinear process. Research on concrete strength shows that the strength increases quickly at first and then levels off, or approaches an asymptote in mathematical terms, over time. Linear models do not describe processes that asymptote very well because for all linear functions the function value can't increase or decrease at a declining rate as the explanatory variables go to the extremes. There are many types of nonlinear models, on the other hand, that describe the asymptotic behavior of a process well. Like the asymptotic behavior of some processes, other features of physical processes can often be expressed more easily using nonlinear models than with simpler model types. Being a \\"least squares\\" procedure, nonlinear least squares has some of the same advantages (and disadvantages) that linear least squares regression has over other methods. One common advantage is efficient use of data. Nonlinear regression can produce good estimates of the unknown parameters in the model with relatively small data sets. Another advantage that nonlinear least squares shares with linear least squares is a fairly well-developed theory for computing confidence, prediction and calibration intervals to answer scientific and engineering questions. In most cases the probabilistic interpretation of the intervals produced by nonlinear regression are only approximately correct, but these intervals still work very well in practice. Disadvantages of Nonlinear Least Squares The major cost of moving to nonlinear least squares regression from simpler modeling techniques like linear least squares is the need to use iterative optimization procedures to compute the parameter estimates. With functions that are linear in the parameters, the least squares estimates of the parameters can always be obtained analytically, while that is generally not the case with nonlinear models. The use of iterative procedures requires the user to provide starting values for the unknown parameters before the software can begin the optimization. The starting values must be reasonably close to the as yet unknown parameter estimates or the optimization procedure may not converge. Bad starting values can also cause the f(x; β) ⃗ = β1x β2 f(x; β) = + exp(− x) ⃗ β0 β1 β2 f(x;⃗ β) = sin( + ) + cos( + ) ⃗ β1 β2 β3x1 β4 β5 β6x2 software to converge to a local minimum rather than the global minimum that defines the least squares estimates. Disadvantages shared with the linear least squares procedure includes a strong sensitivity to outliers. Just as in a linear least squares analysis, the presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously affect the results of a nonlinear analysis. In addition there are unfortunately fewer model validation tools for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than there are for linear regression. Home Aniruddha Bhandari — Updated On October 27th, 2023 Beginner Data Engineering Python Regression Structured Data Technique Master the Art of Data Science: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming an Industry-Ready Data Scientist Download Roadmap × Feature engineering is a critical step in building accurate and effective machine learning models. One key aspect of feature engineering is scaling, normalization, and standardization, which involves transforming the data to make it more suitable for modeling. These techniques can help to improve model performance, reduce the impact of outliers, and ensure that the data is on the same scale. In this article, we will explore the concepts of scaling, normalization, and standardization, including why they are important and how to apply them to different types of data. By the end of this article, you’ll have a thorough understanding of these essential feature engineering techniques and be able to apply them to your own machine learning projects. Table of contents What is Feature Scaling? Why Should we Use Feature Scaling? What is Normalization? What is Standardization? The Big Question – Normalize or Standardize? Implementing Feature Scaling in Python Comparing Unscaled, Normalized, and Standardized Data Applying Scaling to Machine Learning Algorithms Frequently Asked Questions What is Feature Scaling? Feature scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to transform the values of features or variables in a dataset to a similar scale. The purpose is to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model and to avoid the domination of features with larger values. Feature scaling becomes necessary when dealing with datasets containing features that have different ranges, units of measurement, or orders of magnitude. In such cases, the variation in feature values can lead to biased model performance or difficulties during the learning process. There are several common techniques for feature scaling, including standardization, normalization, and min-max scaling. These methods adjust the feature values while preserving their relative relationships and distributions. By applying feature scaling, the dataset’s features can be transformed to a more consistent scale, making it easier to build accurate and effective machine learning models. Scaling facilitates meaningful comparisons between features, improves model convergence, and prevents certain features from overshadowing others based solely on their magnitude. Why Should we Use Feature Scaling? Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling, while others are virtually invariant. Let’s explore these in more depth: 1. Gradient Descent Based Algorithms Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, PCA (principal component analysis), etc., that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. Take a look at the formula for gradient descent below: The presence of feature value X in the formula will affect the step size of the gradient descent. The difference in the ranges of features will cause different step sizes for each feature. To ensure that the gradient descent moves smoothly towards the minima and that the steps for gradient descent are updated at the same rate for all the features, we scale the data before feeding it to the model. 2. Distance-Based Algorithms Distance algorithms like KNN, K-means clustering, and SVM(support vector machines) are most affected by the range of features. This is because, behind the scenes, they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity. For example, let’s say we have data containing high school CGPA scores of students (ranging from 0 to 5) and their future incomes (in thousands Rupees): Since both the features have different scales, there is a chance that higher weightage is given to features with higher magnitudes. This will impact the performance of the machine learning algorithm; obviously, we do not want our algorithm to be biased towards one feature. “ Having features on a similar scale can help the gradient descent converge more quickly towards the minima. ‘ Therefore, we scale our data before employing a distance based algorithm so that all the features contribute equally to the result. The effect of scaling is conspicuous when we compare the Euclidean distance between data points for students A and B, and between B and C, before and after scaling, as shown below: Distance AB before scaling => Distance BC before scaling => Distance AB after scaling => Distance BC after scaling => 3. Tree-Based Algorithms Tree-based algorithms, on the other hand, are fairly insensitive to the scale of the features. Think about it, a decision tree only splits a node based on a single feature. The decision tree splits a node on a feature that increases the homogeneity of the node. Other features do not influence this split on a feature. So, the remaining features have virtually no effect on the split. This is what makes them invariant to the scale of the features! What is Normalization? Normalization is a data preprocessing technique used to adjust the values of features in a dataset to a common scale. This is done to facilitate data analysis and modeling, and to reduce the impact of different scales on the accuracy of machine learning models. Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. Itis also known as Min-Max scaling. Here’s the formula for normalization: Here, Xmax and Xmin are the maximum and the minimum values of the feature, respectively. When the value of X is the minimum value in the column, the numerator will be 0, and hence X’ is 0 On the other hand, when the value of X is the maximum value in the column, the numerator is equal to the denominator, and thus the value of X’ is 1 If the value of X is between the minimum and the maximum value, then the value of X’ is between 0 and 1 What is Standardization? Standardization is another scaling method where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero, and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation. Here’s the formula for standardization: is the mean of the feature values and is the standard deviation of the feature values. Note that, in this case, the values are not restricted to a particular range. Now, the big question in your mind must be when should we use normalization and when should we use standardization? Let’s find out! The Big Question – Normalize or Standardize? Normalization Standardization Rescales values to a range between 0 and 1 Centers data around the mean and scales to a standard deviation of 1 Useful when the distribution of the data is unknown or not Gaussian Useful when the distribution of the data is Gaussian or unknown Sensitive to outliers Less sensitive to outliers Retains the shape of the original distribution Changes the shape of the original distribution May not preserve the relationships between the data points Preserves the relationships between the data points Equation: (x – min)/(max – min) Equation: (x – mean)/standard deviation However, at the end of the day, the choice of using normalization or standardization will depend on your problem and the machine learning algorithm you are using. There is no hard and fast rule to tell you when to normalize or standardize your data. You can always start by fitting your model to raw, normalized, and standardized data and comparing the performance for the best results. It is a good practice to fit the scaler on the training data and then use it to transform the testing data. This would avoid any data leakage during the model testing process. Also, the scaling of target values is generally not required. Implementing Feature Scaling in Python Now comes the fun part – putting what we have learned into practice. I will be applying feature scaling to a few machine-learning algorithms on the Big Mart dataset. I’ve taken on the DataHack platform. I will skip the preprocessing steps since they are out of the scope of this tutorial. But you can find them neatly explained in this article. Those steps will enable you to reach the top 20 percentile on the hackathon leaderboard, so that’s worth checking out! view raw So, let’s first split our data into training and testing sets: Python Code: @ShilpiMazumdar1/feature_scaling A Nix repl by ShilpiMazumdar1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 42 SH Before moving to the feature scaling part, let’s glance at the details of our data using the pd.describe() method: We can see that there is a huge difference in the range of values present in our numerical features: Item_Visibility, Item_Weight, Item_MRP, and Outlet_Establishment_Year. Let’s try and fix that using feature scaling! Note: You will notice negative values in the Item_Visibility feature because I have taken log-transformation to deal with the skewness in the feature. Normalization Using sklearn (scikit-learn) To normalize your data, you need to import the MinMaxScaler from the sklearn library and apply it to our dataset. So, let’s do that! NormalizationVsStandarization_2.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Let’s see how normalization has affected our dataset: 1 # data normalization with sklearn 2 from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler 3 4 # fit scaler on training data 5 norm = MinMaxScaler().fit(X_train) 6 7 # transform training data 8 X_train_norm = norm.transform(X_train) 9 10 # transform testing dataabs 11 X_test_norm = norm.transform(X_test) view raw All the features now have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. Perfect! Try out the above code in the live coding window below!! @LakshayArora1/FeatureScaling A Python repl by LakshayArora1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 22 LA Next, let’s try to standardize our data. Standardization Using sklearn To standardize your data, you need to import the StandardScaler from the sklearn library and apply it to our dataset. Here’s how you can do it: NormalizationVsStandarization_3.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 1 # data standardization with sklearn 2 from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 3 4 # copy of datasets 5 X_train_stand = X_train.copy() 6 X_test_stand = X_test.copy() 7 8 # numerical features 9 num_cols = ['Item_Weight','Item_Visibility','Item_MRP','Outlet_Establishment_Year'] 10 11 # apply standardization on numerical features 12 for i in num_cols: 13 14 # fit on training data column 15 scale = StandardScaler().fit(X_train_stand[[i]]) 16 17 # transform the training data column 18 X_train_stand[i] = scale.transform(X_train_stand[[i]]) 19 20 # transform the testing data column 21 X_test_stand[i] = scale.transform(X_test_stand[[i]]) You would have noticed that I only applied standardization to my numerical columns, not the other One-Hot Encoded features. Standardizing the One-Hot encoded features would mean assigning a distribution to categorical features. You don’t want to do that! But why did I not do the same while normalizing the data? Because One-Hot encoded features are already in the range between 0 to 1. So, normalization would not affect their value. Right, let’s have a look at how standardization has transformed our data: The numerical features are now centered on the mean with a unit standard deviation. Awesome! Comparing Unscaled, Normalized, and Standardized Data It is always great to visualize your data to understand the distribution present. We can see the comparison between our unscaled and scaled data using boxplots. You can learn more about data visualization here. You can notice how scaling the features brings everything into perspective. The features are now more comparable and will have a similar effect on the learning models. Applying Scaling to Machine Learning Algorithms It’s now time to train some machine learning algorithms on our data to compare the effects of different scaling techniques on the algorithm’s performance. I want to see the effect of scaling on three algorithms in particular: KNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regressor, and Decision Tree. K-Nearest Neighbors As we saw before, KNN is a distance-based algorithm that is affected by the range of features. Let’s see how it performs on our data before and after scaling: NormalizationVsStandarization_4.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub view raw You can see that scaling the features has brought down the RMSE score of our KNN model. Specifically, the normalized data performs a tad bit better than the standardized data. Note: I am measuring the RMSE here because this competition evaluates the RMSE. Support Vector Regressor SVR is another distance-based algorithm. So let’s check out whether it works better with normalization or standardization: 1 # training a KNN model 2 from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # knn 7 knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=7) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train, X_train_norm, X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test, X_test_norm, X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 knn.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict 21 pred = knn.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_knn = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_knn 1 # training an SVR model 2 from sklearn.svm import SVR 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # SVR 7 svr = SVR(kernel='rbf',C=5) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train, X_train_norm, X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test, X_test_norm, X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 svr.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict view raw view raw NormalizationVsStandarization_5.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub We can see that scaling the features does bring down the RMSE score. And the standardized data has performed better than the normalized data. Why do you think that’s the case? The sklearn documentation states that SVM, with RBF kernel, assumes that all the features are centered around zero and variance is of the same order. This is because a feature with a variance greater than that of others prevents the estimator from learning from all the features. Great! Decision Tree We already know that a Decision tree is invariant to feature scaling. But I wanted to show a practical example of how it performs on the data: NormalizationVsStandarization_6.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 21 pred = svr.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_svr = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_svr 1 # training a Decision Tree model 2 from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # Decision tree 7 dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=10,random_state=27) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train,X_train_norm,X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test,X_test_norm,X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 dt.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict 21 pred = dt.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_dt = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_dt You can see that the RMSE score has not moved an inch on scaling the features.

Frequently Asked Questions Q1. How is Standardization differentfrom Normalization feature scaling? A. Standardization centers data around a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, while normalization scales data to a set range, often [0, 1], by using the minimum and maximum values. Q2. Why is Standardization used in machine learning? A. Standardization ensures algorithmic stability and prevents sensitivity to the scale of input features, improves optimization algorithms’ convergence and search efficiency, and enhances the performance of certain machine learning algorithms. Q3. Why is Normalization used in machine learning? A. Normalization helps in scaling the input features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1], to ensure that no single feature disproportionately impacts the results. It preserves the relationship between the minimum and maximum values of each feature, which can be important for some algorithms. It also improves the convergence and stability of some machine learning algorithms, particularly those that use gradient-based optimization. Q4. Why do we normalize values? A. We normalize values to bring them into a common scale, making it easier to compare and analyze data. Normalization also helps to reduce the impact of outliers and improve the accuracy and stability of statistical models. Q5. How do you normalize a set of values? A. To normalize a set of values, we first calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data. Then, we subtract the mean from each value and divide by the standard deviation to obtain standardized values with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Alternatively, we can use other normalization techniques such as min-max normalization, where we scale the values to a range of 0 to 1, or unit vector normalization, where we scale the values to have a length of 1. Feature scaling feature scaling machine learning feature scaling python live coding normalizaiton vs. standardization normalization standardization “Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.” — Dr. Jason Brownlee This gives us an idea about feature engineering being the process of transforming data into features to act as inputs for machine learning models such that good quality features help in improving the overall model performance. Features are also very much dependent on the underlying problem. Thus, even though the machine learning task might be same in different scenarios, like classification of emails into spam and non-spam or classifying handwritten digits, the features extracted in each scenario will be very different from the other. Prof. Pedro Domingos from the University of Washington, in his paper titled, “A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning” tells us the following. “At the end of the day, some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the dif erence? Easily the most important factor is the features used.” — Prof. Pedro Domingos The final quote which should motivate you about feature engineering is from renowned Kaggler, Xavier Conort. Most of you already know that tough real-world machine learning problems are often posted on Kaggle regularly which is usually open to everyone. “The algorithms we used are very standard for Kagglers. …We spent most of our ef orts in feature engineering. … We were also very careful to discard features likely to expose us to the risk of over-fitting our model.” — Xavier Conort Understanding Features A feature is typically a specific representation on top of raw data, which is an individual, measurable attribute, typically depicted by a column in a dataset. Considering a generic two-dimensional dataset, each observation is depicted by a row and each feature by a column, which will have a specific value for an observation. A generic dataset snapshot Thus like in the example in the figure above, each row typically indicates a feature vector and the entire set of features across all the observations forms a two-dimensional feature matrix also known as a feature-set. This is akin to data frames or spreadsheets representing two-dimensional data. Typically machine learning algorithms work with these numeric matrices or tensors and hence most feature engineering techniques deal with converting raw data into some numeric representations which can be easily understood by these algorithms. Features can be of two major types based on the dataset. Inherent raw features are obtained directly from the dataset with no extra data manipulation or engineering. Derived features are usually obtained from feature engineering, where we extract features from existing data attributes. A simple example would be creating a new feature “Age” from an employee dataset containing “Birthdate” by just subtracting their birth date from the current date. There are diverse types and formats of data including structured and unstructured data. In this article, we will discuss various feature engineering strategies for dealing with structured continuous numeric data. All these examples are a part of one of my recent books ‘Practical Machine Learning with Python’ and you can access relevant datasets and code used in this article on GitHub. A big shout out also goes to Gabriel Moreira who helped me by providing some excellent pointers on feature engineering techniques. Feature Engineering on Numeric Data Numeric data typically represents data in the form of scalar values depicting observations, recordings or measurements. Here, by numeric data, we mean continuous data and not discrete data which is typically represented as categorical data. Numeric data can also be represented as a vector of values where each value or entity in the vector can represent a specific feature. Integers and floats are the most common and widely used numeric data types for continuous numeric data. Even though numeric data can be directly fed into machine learning models, you would still need to engineer features which are relevant to the scenario, problem and domain before building a model. Hence the need for feature engineering still remains. Let’s leverage python and look at some strategies for feature engineering on numeric data. We load up the following necessary dependencies first (typically in a Jupyter notebook). import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import scipy.stats as spstats %matplotlib inline Raw Measures Like we mentioned earlier, raw numeric data can often be fed directly to machine learning models based on the context and data format. Raw measures are typically indicated using numeric variables directly as features without any form of transformation or engineering. Typically these features can indicate values or counts. Let’s load up one of our datasets, the Pokémon dataset also available on Kaggle. poke_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/Pokemon.csv', encoding='utf-8') poke_df.head() Snapshot of our Pokemon dataset Pokémon is a huge media franchise surrounding fictional characters called Pokémon which stands for pocket monsters. In short, you can think of them as fictional animals with superpowers! This dataset consists of these characters with various statistics for each character. Values If you closely observe the data frame snapshot in the above figure, you can see that several attributes represent numeric raw values which can be used directly. The following snippet depicts some of these features with more emphasis. poke_df[['HP', 'Attack', 'Defense']].head() Features with (continuous) numeric data Thus, you can directly use these attributes as features which are depicted in the above data frame. These include each Pokémon’s HP (Hit Points), Attack and Defense stats. In fact, we can also compute some basic statistical measures on these fields. poke_df[['HP', 'Attack', 'Defense']].describe() Basic descriptive statistics on numeric features With this you can get a good idea about statistical measures in these features like count, average, standard deviation and quartiles. Counts Another form of raw measures include features which represent frequencies, counts or occurrences of specific attributes. Let’s look at a sample of data from the millionsong dataset which depicts counts or frequencies of songs which have been heard by various users. popsong_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/song_views.csv', encoding='utf-8') popsong_df.head(10) Song listen counts as a numeric feature It is quite evident from the above snapshot that the listen_count field can be used directly as a frequencycount based numeric feature. Binarization Often raw frequencies or counts may not be relevant for building a model based on the problem which is being solved. For instance if I’m building a recommendation system for song recommendations, I would just want to know if a person is interested or has listened to a particular song. This doesn’t require the number of times a song has been listened to since I am more concerned about the various songs heshe has listened to. In this case, a binary feature is preferred as opposed to a count based feature. We can binarize our listen_count field as follows. watched = np.array(popsong_df['listen_count']) watched[watched >= 1] = 1 popsong_df['watched'] = watched You can also use scikit-learn's Binarizer class here from its preprocessing module to perform the same task instead of numpy arrays. from sklearn.preprocessing import Binarizer bn = Binarizer(threshold=0.9) pd_watched = bn.transform([popsong_df['listen_count']])[0] popsong_df['pd_watched'] = pd_watched popsong_df.head(11) Binarizing song counts You can clearly see from the above snapshot that both the methods have produced the same result. Thus we get a binarized feature indicating if the song was listened to or not by each user which can be then further used in a relevant model. Rounding Often when dealing with continuous numeric attributes like proportions or percentages, we may not need the raw values having a high amount of precision. Hence it often makes sense to round off these high precision percentages into numeric integers. These integers can then be directly used as raw values or even as categorical (discrete-class based) features. Let’s try applying this concept in a dummy dataset depicting store items and their popularity percentages. items_popularity = pd.read_csv('datasets/item_popularity.csv', encoding='utf-8') items_popularity['popularity_scale_10'] = np.array( np.round((items_popularity['pop_percent'] * 10)), dtype='int') items_popularity['popularity_scale_100'] = np.array( np.round((items_popularity['pop_percent'] * 100)), dtype='int') items_popularity Rounding popularity to different scales Based on the above ouputs, you can guess that we tried two forms of rounding. The features depict the item popularities now both on a scale of 1–10 and on a scale of 1–100. You can use these values both as numerical or categorical features based on the scenario and problem. Interactions Supervised machine learning models usually try to model the output responses (discrete classes or continuous values) as a function of the input feature variables. For example, a simple linear regression equation can be depicted as where the input features are depicted by variables having weights or coefficients denoted by respectively and the goal is to predict the response y. In this case, this simple linear model depicts the relationship between the output and inputs, purely based on the individual, separate input features. However, often in several real-world scenarios, it makes sense to also try and capture the interactions between these feature variables as a part of the input feature set. A simple depiction of the extension of the above linear regression formulation with interaction features would be where the features represented by denote the interaction features. Let’s try engineering some interaction features on our Pokémon dataset now. atk_def = poke_df[['Attack', 'Defense']] atk_def.head() From the output data frame, we can see that we have two numeric (continuous) features, Attack and Defence . We will now build features up to the 2nd degree by leveraging scikit-learn . from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures pf = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=False, include_bias=False) res = pf.fit_transform(atk_def) res Output ------ array([[ 49., 49., 2401., 2401., 2401.], [ 62., 63., 3844., 3906., 3969.], [ 82., 83., 6724., 6806., 6889.], ..., [ 110., 60., 12100., 6600., 3600.], [ 160., 60., 25600., 9600., 3600.], [ 110., 120., 12100., 13200., 14400.]]) The above feature matrix depicts a total of five features including the new interaction features. We can see the degree of each feature in the above matrix as follows. pd.DataFrame(pf.powers_, columns=['Attack_degree', 'Defense_degree']) Looking at this output, we now know what each feature actually represents from the degrees depicted here. Armed with this knowledge, we can assign a name to each feature now as follows. This is just for ease of understanding and you should name your features with better, easy to access and simple names. intr_features = pd.DataFrame(res, columns=['Attack', 'Defense', 'Attack^2', 'Attack x Defense', 'Defense^2']) intr_features.head(5) Numeric features with their interactions Thus the above data frame represents our original features along with their interaction features. Binning The problem of working with raw, continuous numeric features is that often the distribution of values in these features will be skewed. This signifies that some values will occur quite frequently while some will be quite rare. Besides this, there is also another problem of the varying range of values in any of these features. For instance view counts of specific music videos could be abnormally large (Despacito we’re looking at you!) and some could be really small. Directly using these features can cause a lot of issues and adversely affect the model. Hence there are strategies to deal with this, which include binning and transformations. Binning, also known as quantization is used for transforming continuous numeric features into discrete ones (categories). These discrete values or numbers can be thought of as categories or bins into which the raw, continuous numeric values are binned or grouped into. Each bin represents a specific degree of intensity and hence a specific range of continuous numeric values fall into it. Specific strategies of binning data include fixed-width and adaptive binning. Let’s use a subset of data from a dataset extracted from the 2016 FreeCodeCamp DeveloperCoder survey which talks about various attributes pertaining to coders and software developers. fcc_survey_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/fcc_2016_coder_survey_subset.csv', encoding='utf-8') fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'EmploymentField', 'Age', 'Income']].head() Sample attributes from the FCC coder survey dataset The ID.x variable is basically a unique identifier for each coderdeveloper who took the survey and the other fields are pretty self-explanatory. Fixed-Width Binning Just like the name indicates, in fixed-width binning, we have specific fixed widths for each of the bins which are usually pre-defined by the user analyzing the data. Each bin has a pre-fixed range of values which should be assigned to that bin on the basis of some domain knowledge, rules or constraints. Binning based on rounding is one of the ways, where you can use the rounding operation which we discussed earlier to bin raw values. Let’s now consider the Age feature from the coder survey dataset and look at its distribution. fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Age'].hist(color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) ax.set_title('Developer Age Histogram', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Age', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer age distribution The above histogram depicting developer ages is slightly right skewed as expected (lesser aged developers). We will now assign these raw age values into specific bins based on the following scheme Age Range: Bin --------------- 0 - 9 : 0 10 - 19 : 1 20 - 29 : 2 30 - 39 : 3 40 - 49 : 4 50 - 59 : 5 60 - 69 : 6 ... and so on We can easily do this using what we learnt in the Rounding section earlier where we round off these raw age values by taking the floor value after dividing it by 10. fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_round'] = np.array(np.floor( np.array(fcc_survey_df['Age']) / 10.)) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Age_bin_round']].iloc[1071:1076] Binning by rounding You can see the corresponding bins for each age have been assigned based on rounding. But what if we need more flexibility? What if we want to decide and fix the bin widths based on our own ruleslogic? Binning based on custom ranges will help us achieve this. Let’s define some custom age ranges for binning developer ages using the following scheme. Age Range : Bin --------------- 0 - 15 : 1 16 - 30 : 2 31 - 45 : 3 46 - 60 : 4 61 - 75 : 5 75 - 100 : 6 Based on this custom binning scheme, we will now label the bins for each developer age value and we will store both the bin range as well as the corresponding label. bin_ranges = [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 100] bin_names = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_custom_range'] = pd.cut( np.array( fcc_survey_df['Age']), bins=bin_ranges) fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_custom_label'] = pd.cut( np.array( fcc_survey_df['Age']), bins=bin_ranges, labels=bin_names) # view the binned features fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Age_bin_round', 'Age_bin_custom_range', 'Age_bin_custom_label']].iloc[10a71:1076] Custom binning scheme for developer ages Adaptive Binning The drawback in using fixed-width binning is that due to us manually deciding the bin ranges, we can end up with irregular bins which are not uniform based on the number of data points or values which fall in each bin. Some of the bins might be densely populated and some of them might be sparsely populated or even empty! Adaptive binning is a safer strategy in these scenarios where we let the data speak for itself! That’s right, we use the data distribution itself to decide our bin ranges. Quantile based binning is a good strategy to use for adaptive binning. Quantiles are specific values or cut-points which help in partitioning the continuous valued distribution of a specific numeric field into discrete contiguous bins or intervals. Thus, q-Quantiles help in partitioning a numeric attribute into q equal partitions. Popular examples of quantiles include the 2-Quantile known as the median which divides the data distribution into two equal bins, 4-Quantiles known as the quartiles which divide the data into 4 equal bins and 10-Quantiles also known as the deciles which create 10 equal width bins. Let’s now look at the data distribution for the developer Income field. fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer income distribution The above distribution depicts a right skew in the income with lesser developers earning more money and vice versa. Let’s take a 4-Quantile or a quartile based adaptive binning scheme. We can obtain the quartiles easily as follows. quantile_list = [0, .25, .5, .75, 1.] quantiles = fcc_survey_df['Income'].quantile(quantile_list) quantiles Output ------ 0.00 6000.0 0.25 20000.0 0.50 37000.0 0.75 60000.0 1.00 200000.0 Name: Income, dtype: float64 Let’s now visualize these quantiles in the original distribution histogram! fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) for quantile in quantiles: qvl = plt.axvline(quantile, color='r') ax.legend([qvl], ['Quantiles'], fontsize=10) ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram with Quantiles', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer income distribution with quartile values The red lines in the distribution above depict the quartile values and our potential bins. Let’s now leverage this knowledge to build our quartile based binning scheme. quantile_labels = ['0-25Q', '25-50Q', '50-75Q', '75-100Q'] fcc_survey_df['Income_quantile_range'] = pd.qcut( fcc_survey_df['Income'], q=quantile_list) fcc_survey_df['Income_quantile_label'] = pd.qcut( fcc_survey_df['Income'], q=quantile_list, labels=quantile_labels) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_quantile_range', 'Income_quantile_label']].iloc[4:9] Quantile based bin ranges and labels for developer incomes This should give you a good idea of how quantile based adaptive binning works. An important point to remember here is that the resultant outcome of binning leads to discrete valued categorical features and you might need an additional step of feature engineering on the categorical data before using it in any model. We will cover feature engineering strategies for categorical data shortly in the next part! Statistical Transformations We talked about the adverse effects of skewed data distributions briefly earlier. Let’s look at a different strategy of feature engineering now by making use of statistical or mathematical transformations.We will look at the Log transform as well as the Box-Cox transform. Both of these transform functions belong to the Power Transform family of functions, typically used to create monotonic data transformations. Their main significance is that they help in stabilizing variance, adhering closely to the normal distribution and making the data independent of the mean based on its distribution Log Transform The log transform belongs to the power transform family of functions. This function can be mathematically represented as which reads as log of x to the base b is equal to y. This can then be translated into which indicates as to what power must the base b be raised to in order to get x. The natural logarithm uses b=e where e = 2.71828 popularly known as Euler’s number. You can also use base b=10 used popularly in the decimal system. Log transforms are useful when applied to skewed distributions as they tend to expand the values which fall in the range of lower magnitudes and tend to compress or reduce the values which fall in the range of higher magnitudes. This tends to make the skewed distribution as normal-like as possible. Let’s use log transform on our developer Income feature which we used earlier. fcc_survey_df['Income_log'] = np.log((1+ fcc_survey_df['Income'])) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_log']].iloc[4:9] Log transform on developer income The Income_log field depicts the transformed feature after log transformation. Let’s look at the data distribution on this transformed field now. income_log_mean = np.round(np.mean(fcc_survey_df['Income_log']), 2) fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income_log'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) plt.axvline(income_log_mean, color='r') ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram after Log Transform', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income (log scale)', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) ax.text(11.5, 450, r'mu='+str(income_log_mean), fontsize=10) Histogram depicting developer income distribution after log transform Based on the above plot, we can clearly see that the distribution is more normal-like or gaussian as compared to the skewed distribution on the original data. Box-Cox Transform The Box-Cox transform is another popular function belonging to the power transform family of functions. This function has a pre-requisite that the numeric values to be transformed must be positive (similar to what log transform expects). In case they are negative, shifting using a constant value helps. Mathematically, the Box-Cox transform function can be denoted as follows. Such that the resulted transformed output y is a function of input x and the transformation parameter λ such that when λ = 0, the resultant transform is the natural log transform which we discussed earlier. The optimal value of λ is usually determined using a maximum likelihood or loglikelihood estimation. Let’s now apply the Box-Cox transform on our developer income feature. First we get the optimal lambda value from the data distribution by removing the non-null values as follows. income = np.array(fcc_survey_df['Income']) income_clean = income[~np.isnan(income)] l, opt_lambda = spstats.boxcox(income_clean) print('Optimal lambda value:', opt_lambda) Output ------ Optimal lambda value: 0.117991239456 Now that we have obtained the optimal λ value, let us use the Box-Cox transform for two values of λ such that λ = 0 and λ = λ(optimal) and transform the developer Income feature. fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_0'] = spstats.boxcox( (1+fcc_survey_df['Income']), lmbda=0) fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt'] = spstats.boxcox( fcc_survey_df['Income'], lmbda=opt_lambda) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_log', 'Income_boxcox_lambda_0', 'Income_boxcox_lambda_opt']].iloc[4:9] Developer income distribution after Box-Cox transform The transformed features are depicted in the above data frame. Just like we expected, Income_log and Income_boxcox_lamba_0 have the same values. Let’s look at the distribution of the transformed Income feature after transforming with the optimal λ. income_boxcox_mean = np.round( np.mean( fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt']),2) fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) plt.axvline(income_boxcox_mean, color='r') ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram after Box–Cox Transform', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income (Box–Cox transform)', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) ax.text(24, 450, r'mu='+str(income_boxcox_mean), fontsize=10) Histogram depicting developer income distribution after Box-Cox transform The distribution looks more normal-like similar to what we obtained after the log transform. Conclusion Feature engineering is a very important aspect of machine learning and data science and should never be ignored. While we have automated feature engineering methodologies like deep learning as well as automated machine learning frameworks like AutoML (which still stresses that it requires good features to work well!). Feature engineering is here to stay and even some of these automated methodologies often require specific engineered features based on the data type, domain and the problem to be solved. We looked at popular strategies for feature engineering on continuous numeric data in this article. In the next part, we will look at popular strategies for dealing with discrete, categorical data and then move on to unstructured data types in future articles. Stay tuned!

In this article, we will look at another type of structured data, which is discrete in nature and is popularly termed as categorical data. Dealing with numeric data is often easier than categorical data given that we do not have to deal with additional complexities of the semantics pertaining to each category value in any data attribute which is of a categorical type. We will use a hands-on approach to discuss several encoding Get unlimited access to the best of Medium for less than 1/week. Become a member schemes for dealing with categorical data and also a couple of popular techniques for dealing with large scale feature explosion, often known as the “curse of dimensionality”. Motivation I’m sure by now you must realize the motivation and the importance of feature engineering, we do stress on the same in detail in ‘Part 1’ of this series. Do check it out for a quick refresher if necessary. In short, machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with categorical data and you do need to do some amount of engineering and transformations on this data before you can start modeling on your data. Understanding Categorical Data Let’s get an idea about categorical data representations before diving into feature engineering strategies. Typically, any data attribute which is categorical in nature represents discrete values which belong to a specific finite set of categories or classes. These are also often known as classes or labels in the context of attributes or variables which are to be predicted by a model (popularly known as response variables). These discrete values can be text or numeric in nature (or even unstructured data like images!). There are two major classes of categorical data, nominal and ordinal. In any nominal categorical data attribute, there is no concept of ordering amongst the values of that attribute. Consider a simple example of weather categories, as depicted in the following figure. We can see that we have six major classes or categories in this particular scenario without any concept or notion of order (windy doesn’t always occur before sunny nor is it smaller or bigger than sunny). Weather as a categorical attribute Similarly movie, music and video game genres, country names, food and cuisine types are other examples of nominal categorical attributes. Ordinal categorical attributes have some sense or notion of order amongst its values. For instance look at the following figure for shirt sizes. It is quite evident that order or in this case ‘size’ matters when thinking about shirts (S is smaller than M which is smaller than L and so on). Shirt size as an ordinal categorical attribute Shoe sizes, education level and employment roles are some other examples of ordinal categorical attributes. Having a decent idea about categorical data, let’s now look at some feature engineering strategies. Feature Engineering on Categorical Data While a lot of advancements have been made in various machine learning frameworks to accept complex categorical data types like text labels. Typically any standard workflow in feature engineering involves some form of transformation of these categorical values into numeric labels and then applying some encoding scheme on these values. We load up the necessary essentials before getting started. import pandas as pd import numpy as np Transforming Nominal Attributes Nominal attributes consist of discrete categorical values with no notion or sense of order amongst them. The idea here is to transform these attributes into a more representative numerical format which can be easily understood by downstream code and pipelines. Let’s look at a new dataset pertaining to video game sales. This dataset is also available on Kaggle as well as in my GitHub repository. vg_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/vgsales.csv', encoding='utf-8') vg_df[['Name', 'Platform', 'Year', 'Genre', 'Publisher']].iloc[1:7] Dataset for video game sales Let’s focus on the video game Genre attribute as depicted in the above data frame. It is quite evident that this is a nominal categorical attribute just like Publisher and Platform . We can easily get the list of unique video game genres as follows. genres = np.unique(vg_df['Genre']) genres Output ------ array(['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fighting', 'Misc', 'Platform', 'Puzzle', 'Racing', 'Role-Playing', 'Shooter', 'Simulation', 'Sports', 'Strategy'], dtype=object) This tells us that we have 12 distinct video game genres. We can now generate a label encoding scheme for mapping each category to a numeric value by leveraging scikit-learn . from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder gle = LabelEncoder() genre_labels = gle.fit_transform(vg_df['Genre']) genre_mappings = {index: label for index, label in enumerate(gle.classes_)} genre_mappings Output ------ {0: 'Action', 1: 'Adventure', 2: 'Fighting', 3: 'Misc', 4: 'Platform', 5: 'Puzzle', 6: 'Racing', 7: 'Role-Playing', 8: 'Shooter', 9: 'Simulation', 10: 'Sports', 11: 'Strategy'} Thus a mapping scheme has been generated where each genre value is mapped to a number with the help of the LabelEncoder object gle . The transformed labels are stored in the genre_labels value which we can write back to our data frame. vg_df['GenreLabel'] = genre_labels vg_df[['Name', 'Platform', 'Year', 'Genre', 'GenreLabel']].iloc[1:7] Video game genres with their encoded labels These labels can be used directly often especially with frameworks like scikitlearn if you plan to use them as response variables for prediction, however as discussed earlier, we will need an additional step of encoding on these before we can use them as features. Transforming Ordinal Attributes Ordinal attributes are categorical attributes with a sense of order amongst the values. Let’s consider our Pokémon dataset which we used in Part 1 of this series. Let’s focus more specifically on the Generation attribute. poke_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/Pokemon.csv', encoding='utf-8') poke_df = poke_df.sample(random_state=1, frac=1).reset_index(drop=True) np.unique(poke_df['Generation']) Output ------ array(['Gen 1', 'Gen 2', 'Gen 3', 'Gen 4', 'Gen 5', 'Gen 6'], dtype=object) Based on the above output, we can see there are a total of 6 generations and each Pokémon typically belongs to a specific generation based on the video games (when they were released) and also the television series follows a similar timeline. This attribute is typically ordinal (domain knowledge is necessary here) because most Pokémon belonging to Generation 1 were introduced earlier in the video games and the television shows than Generation 2 as so on. Fans can check out the following figure to remember some of the popular Pokémon of each generation (views may differ among fans!). Popular Pokémon based on generation and type (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2s2upx/heres_my_favorite_pokemon_by_type_and_gen_chart) Hence they have a sense of order amongst them. In general, there is no generic module or function to map and transform these features into numeric representations based on order automatically. Hence we can use a custom encodingmapping scheme. gen_ord_map = {'Gen 1': 1, 'Gen 2': 2, 'Gen 3': 3, 'Gen 4': 4, 'Gen 5': 5, 'Gen 6': 6} poke_df['GenerationLabel'] = poke_df['Generation'].map(gen_ord_map) poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'GenerationLabel']].iloc[4:10] Pokémon generation encoding It is quite evident from the above code that the map(…) function from pandas is quite helpful in transforming this ordinal feature. Encoding Categorical Attributes If you remember what we mentioned earlier, typically feature engineering on categorical data involves a transformation process which we depicted in the previous section and a compulsory encoding process where we apply specific encoding schemes to create dummy variables or features for each categoryvalue in a specific categorical attribute. You might be wondering, we just converted categories to numerical labels in the previous section, why on earth do we need this now? The reason is quite simple. Considering video game genres, if we directly fed the GenreLabel attribute as a feature in a machine learning model, it would consider it to be a continuous numeric feature thinking value 10 (Sports) is greater than 6 (Racing) but that is meaningless because the Sports genre is certainly not bigger or smaller than Racing, these are essentially different values or categories which cannot be compared directly. Hence we need an additional layer of encoding schemes where dummy features are created for each unique value or category out of all the distinct categories per attribute. One-hot Encoding Scheme Considering we have the numeric representation of any categorical attribute with m labels (after transformation), the one-hot encoding scheme, encodes or transforms the attribute into m binary features which can only contain a value of 1 or 0. Each observation in the categorical feature is thus converted into a vector of size m with only one of the values as 1 (indicating it as active). Let’s take a subset of our Pokémon dataset depicting two attributes of interest. poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Legendary']].iloc[4:10] Subset of our Pokémon dataset The attributes of interest are Pokémon Generation and their Legendary status. The first step is to transform these attributes into numeric representations based on what we learnt earlier. from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder # transform and map pokemon generations gen_le = LabelEncoder() gen_labels = gen_le.fit_transform(poke_df['Generation']) poke_df['Gen_Label'] = gen_labels # transform and map pokemon legendary status leg_le = LabelEncoder() leg_labels = leg_le.fit_transform(poke_df['Legendary']) poke_df['Lgnd_Label'] = leg_labels poke_df_sub = poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label', 'Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label']] poke_df_sub.iloc[4:10] Attributes with transformed (numeric) labels The features Gen_Label and Lgnd_Label now depict the numeric representations of our categorical features. Let’s now apply the one-hot encoding scheme on these features. # encode generation labels using one-hot encoding scheme gen_ohe = OneHotEncoder() gen_feature_arr = gen_ohe.fit_transform( poke_df[['Gen_Label']]).toarray() gen_feature_labels = list(gen_le.classes_) gen_features = pd.DataFrame(gen_feature_arr, columns=gen_feature_labels) # encode legendary status labels using one-hot encoding scheme leg_ohe = OneHotEncoder() leg_feature_arr = leg_ohe.fit_transform( poke_df[['Lgnd_Label']]).toarray() leg_feature_labels = ['Legendary_'+str(cls_label) for cls_label in leg_le.classes_] leg_features = pd.DataFrame(leg_feature_arr, columns=leg_feature_labels) In general, you can always encode both the features together using the fit_transform(…) function by passing it a two dimensional array of the two features together (Check out the documentation!). But we encode each feature separately, to make things easier to understand. Besides this, we can also create separate data frames and label them accordingly. Let’s now concatenate these feature frames and see the final result. poke_df_ohe = pd.concat([poke_df_sub, gen_features, leg_features], axis=1) columns = sum([['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label'], gen_feature_labels, ['Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label'], leg_feature_labels], []) poke_df_ohe[columns].iloc[4:10] One-hot encoded features for Pokémon generation and legendary status Thus you can see that 6 dummy variables or binary features have been created for Generation and 2 for Legendary since those are the total number of distinct categories in each of these attributes respectively. Active state of a category is indicated by the 1 value in one of these dummy variables which is quite evident from the above data frame. Consider you built this encoding scheme on your training data and built some model and now you have some new data which has to be engineered for features before predictions as follows. new_poke_df = pd.DataFrame([['PikaZoom', 'Gen 3', True], ['CharMyToast', 'Gen 4', False]], columns=['Name', 'Generation', 'Legendary']) new_poke_df Sample new data You can leverage scikit-learn’s excellent API here by calling the transform(…) function of the previously build LabeLEncoder and OneHotEncoder objects on the new data. Remember our workflow, first we do the transformation. new_gen_labels = gen_le.transform(new_poke_df['Generation']) new_poke_df['Gen_Label'] = new_gen_labels new_leg_labels = leg_le.transform(new_poke_df['Legendary']) new_poke_df['Lgnd_Label'] = new_leg_labels new_poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label', 'Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label']] Categorical attributes after transformation Once we have numerical labels, let’s apply the encoding scheme now! new_gen_feature_arr = gen_ohe.transform(new_poke_df[['Gen_Label']]).toarray() new_gen_features = pd.DataFrame(new_gen_feature_arr, columns=gen_feature_labels) new_leg_feature_arr = leg_ohe.transform(new_poke_df[['Lgnd_Label']]).toarray() new_leg_features = pd.DataFrame(new_leg_feature_arr, columns=leg_feature_labels) new_poke_ohe = pd.concat([new_poke_df, new_gen_features, new_leg_features], axis=1) columns = sum([['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label'], gen_feature_labels, ['Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label'], leg_feature_labels], []) new_poke_ohe[columns] Categorical attributes after one-hot encoding Thus you can see it’s quite easy to apply this scheme on new data easily by leveraging scikit-learn’s powerful API. You can also apply the one-hot encoding scheme easily by leveraging the to_dummies(…) function from pandas . gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_onehot_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] One-hot encoded features by leveraging pandas The above data frame depicts the one-hot encoding scheme applied on the Generation attribute and the results are same as compared to the earlier results as expected. Dummy Coding Scheme The dummy coding scheme is similar to the one-hot encoding scheme, except in the case of dummy coding scheme, when applied on a categorical feature with m distinct labels, we get m - 1 binary features. Thus each value of the categorical variable gets converted into a vector of size m - 1. The extra feature is completely disregarded and thus if the category values range from {0, 1, …, m-1} the 0th or the m - 1th feature column is dropped and corresponding category values are usually represented by a vector of all zeros (0). Let’s try applying dummy coding scheme on Pokémon Generation by dropping the first level binary encoded feature ( Gen 1 ). gen_dummy_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation'], drop_first=True) pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_dummy_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Dummy coded features for Pokémon g eneration If you want, you can also choose to drop the last level binary encoded feature ( Gen 6 ) as follows. gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) gen_dummy_features = gen_onehot_features.iloc[:,:-1] pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_dummy_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Dummy coded features for Pokémon g eneration Open in app Search Based on the above depictions, it is quite clear that categories belonging to the dropped feature are represented as a vector of zeros (0) like we discussed earlier. Effect Coding Scheme The effect coding scheme is actually very similar to the dummy coding scheme, except during the encoding process, the encoded features or feature vector, for the category values which represent all 0 in the dummy coding scheme, is replaced by -1 in the effect coding scheme. This will become clearer with the following example. gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) gen_effect_features = gen_onehot_features.iloc[:,:-1] gen_effect_features.loc[np.all(gen_effect_features == 0, axis=1)] = -1. pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_effect_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Effect coded features for Pokémon g eneration The above output clearly shows that the Pokémon belonging to Generation 6 are now represented by a vector of -1 values as compared to zeros in dummy coding. Bin-counting Scheme The encoding schemes we discussed so far, work quite well on categorical data in general, but they start causing problems when the number of distinct categories in any feature becomes very large. Essential for any categorical feature of m distinct labels, you get m separate features. This can easily increase the size of the feature set causing problems like storage issues, model training problems with regard to time, space and memory. Besides this, we also have to deal with what is popularly known as the ‘curse of dimensionality’ where basically with an enormous number of features and not enough representative samples, model performance starts getting affected often leading to overfitting. Hence we need to look towards other categorical data feature engineering schemes for features having a large number of possible categories (like IP addresses). The bin-counting scheme is a useful scheme for dealing with categorical variables having many categories. In this scheme, instead of using the actual label values for encoding, we use probability based statistical information about the value and the actual target or response value which we aim to predict in our modeling efforts. A simple example would be based on past historical data for IP addresses and the ones which were used in DDOS attacks; we can build probability values for a DDOS attack being caused by any of the IP addresses. Using this information, we can encode an input feature which depicts that if the same IP address comes in the future, what is the probability value of a DDOS attack being caused. This scheme needs historical data as a pre-requisite and is an elaborate one. Depicting this with a complete example would be currently difficult here but there are several resources online which you can refer to for the same. Feature Hashing Scheme The feature hashing scheme is another useful feature engineering scheme for dealing with large scale categorical features. In this scheme, a hash function is typically used with the number of encoded features pre-set (as a vector of predefined length) such that the hashed values of the features are used as indices in this pre-defined vector and values are updated accordingly. Since a hash function maps a large number of values into a small finite set of values, multiple different values might create the same hash which is termed as collisions. Typically, a signed hash function is used so that the sign of the value obtained from the hash is used as the sign of the value which is stored in the final feature vector at the appropriate index. This should ensure lesser collisions and lesser accumulation of error due to collisions. Hashing schemes work on strings, numbers and other structures like vectors. You can think of hashed outputs as a finite set of b bins such that when hash function is applied on the same valuescategories, they get assigned to the same bin (or subset of bins) out of the b bins based on the hash value. We can pre-define the value of b which becomes the final size of the encoded feature vector for each categorical attribute that we encode using the feature hashing scheme. Thus even if we have over 1000 distinct categories in a feature and we set b=10 as the final feature vector size, the output feature set will still have only 10 features as compared to 1000 binary features if we used a one-hot encoding scheme. Let’s consider the Genre attribute in our video game dataset. unique_genres = np.unique(vg_df[['Genre']]) print(\\"Total game genres:\\", len(unique_genres)) print(unique_genres) Output ------ Total game genres: 12 ['Action' 'Adventure' 'Fighting' 'Misc' 'Platform' 'Puzzle' 'Racing' 'Role-Playing' 'Shooter' 'Simulation' 'Sports' 'Strategy'] We can see that there are a total of 12 genres of video games. If we used a one-hot encoding scheme on the Genre feature, we would end up having 12 binary features. Instead, we will now use a feature hashing scheme by leveraging scikit-learn’s FeatureHasher class, which uses a signed 32-bit version of the Murmurhash3 hash function. We will pre-define the final feature vector size to be 6 in this case. from sklearn.feature_extraction import FeatureHasher fh = FeatureHasher(n_features=6, input_type='string') hashed_features = fh.fit_transform(vg_df['Genre']) hashed_features = hashed_features.toarray() pd.concat([vg_df[['Name', 'Genre']], pd.DataFrame(hashed_features)], axis=1).iloc[1:7] Feature Hashing on the Genre attribute Based on the above output, the Genre categorical attribute has been encoded using the hashing scheme into 6 features instead of 12. We can also see that rows 1 and 6 denote the same genre of games, Platform which have been rightly encoded into the same feature vector. Conclusion These examples should give you a good idea about popular strategies for feature engineering on discrete, categorical data. If you read Part 1 of this series, you would have seen that it is slightly challenging to work with categorical data as compared to continuous, numeric data but definitely interesting! We also talked about some ways to handle large feature spaces using feature engineering but you should also remember that there are other techniques including feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods to handle large feature spaces. We will cover some of these methods in a later article. Next up will be feature engineering strategies for unstructured text data. Stay tuned! To read about feature engineering strategies for continuous numeric data, check out Part 1 of this series! All the code and datasets used in this article can be accessed from my GitHub The code is also available as a Jupyter notebook Machine Learning Data Science Feature Engineering Programming Tds Feature Engineering In this article, we will look at various feature engineering techniques for extracting useful information using the datetime column. And if you’re new to time series, I encourage you to check out the below free course: Creating Time Series Forecast using Python Table of contents Overview Introduction Quick Introduction to Time Series Setting up the Problem Statement for Time Series Data Feature Engineering for Time Series #1: Date-Related Features Feature Engineering for Time Series #2: Time-Based Features Feature Engineering for Time Series #3: Lag Features Feature Engineering for Time Series #4: Rolling Window Feature Feature Engineering for Time Series #5: Expanding Window Feature Feature Engineering for Time Series #6: Domain-Specific Features Validation Technique for Time Series Frequently Asked Questions End Notes Quick Introduction to Time Series Before we look at the feature engineering techniques, let’s brush over some basic time series concepts. We’ll be using them throughout the article so it’s best to be acquainted with them here. So, what makes time series projects different from the traditional machine learning problems? Let’s take a simple example to understand this. If we want to predict today’s stock price for a certain company, it would be helpful to have information about yesterday’s closing price, right? Similarly, predicting the traffic on a website would be a lot easier if we have data about the last few months or years. There’s another thing we need to consider – time series data may also have certain trends or seasonality. Take a look at the plot shown below about the number of tickets booked for an airline over the years: “ In a time series, the data is captured at equal intervals and each successive data point in the series depends on its past values. view raw view raw We can clearly see an increasing trend. Such information can be useful for making more accurate predictions. Now, let’s take a dataset with date-time variables and start learning about feature engineering! Setting up the Problem Statement for Time Series Data We’ll be working on a fascinating problem to learn feature engineering techniques for time series. We have the historical data for ‘JetRail’, a form of public rail transport, that uses advanced technology to run rails at a high speed. JetRail’s usage has increased recently and we have to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months based on past data. Let’s see how we can help JetRail’s management team solve this problem. You can go through the detailed problem statement and download the dataset from here. Let’s load the dataset in our notebook: loading_data.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub We have two columns here – so it’s clearly a univariate time series. Also, the data type of the date variable is taken as an object, i.e. it is being treated as a categorical variable. Hence, we will need to convert this into a DateTime variable. We can do this using the appropriately titled datetime function in Pandas: changing_dtype.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Now that we have the data ready, let’s look at the different features we can engineer from this variable. Along with each of these feature engineering techniques, we will discuss different scenarios where that particular technique can be useful. NOTE: I have taken a simple time series problem to demonstrate the different feature engineering techniques in this article. You can use them on a dataset of your choice as long as the date-time column is present. Feature Engineering for Time Series #1: Date-Related Features Have you ever worked in a product company? You’ll be intimately familiar with the task of forecasting the sales for a particular product. We can find out the sales pattern for weekdays and weekends based on historical data. Thus, having information about the day, month, year, etc. can be useful for forecasting the values. Let’s get back to our JetRail project. We have to forecast the count of people who will take the JetRail on an hourly basis for the next 7 months. This number could be higher for weekdays and lower for weekends or during the festive seasons. Hence, the day of the week (weekday or weekend) or month will be an important factor. Extracting these features is really easy in Python: 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data.dtypes 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 data.dtypes 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') view raw view raw date_features.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Feature Engineering for Time Series #2: Time-Based Features We can similarly extract more granular features if we have the time stamp. For instance, we can determine the hour or minute of the day when the data was recorded and compare the trends between the business hours and non-business hours. If we are able to extract the ‘hour’ feature from the time stamp, we can make more insightful conclusions about the data. We could find out if the traffic on JetRail is higher during the morning, afternoon or evening time. Or we could use the value to determine the average hourly traffic throughout the week, i.e. the number of people who used JetRail between 9-10 am, 10-11 am, and so on (throughout the week). Extracting time-based features is very similar to what we did above when extracting date-related features. We start by converting the column to DateTime format and use the .dt accessor. Here’s how to do it in Python: time_features.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Similarly, we can extract a number of features from the date column. Here’s a complete list of features that we can generate: 4 5 data['year']=data['Datetime'].dt.year 6 data['month']=data['Datetime'].dt.month 7 data['day']=data['Datetime'].dt.day 8 9 data['dayofweek_num']=data['Datetime'].dt.dayofweek 10 data['dayofweek_name']=data['Datetime'].dt.weekday_name 11 12 data.head() 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['Hour'] = data['Datetime'].dt.hour 6 data['minute'] = data['Datetime'].dt.minute 7 8 data.head() Run the code below to generate the date and hour features for the given data. You can select any of the above functions and run the following code to generate a new feature for the same! @ L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 / Time B a s e d F e a t u r e s A P y t h o n r e p l b y L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 O p e n o n R e p lit S h o w c o d e 0 R u n L A view raw view raw Feature Engineering for Time Series #3: Lag Features Here’s something most aspiring data scientists don’t think about when working on a time series problem – we can also use the target variable for feature engineering! Consider this – you are predicting the stock price for a company. So, the previous day’s stock price is important to make a prediction, right? In other words, the value at time t is greatly affected by the value at time t-1. The past values are known as lags, so t-1 is lag 1, t-2 is lag 2, and so on. lag_feature.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Here, we were able to generate lag one feature for our series. But why lag one? Why not five or seven? That’s a good question. If the series has a weekly trend, which means the value last Monday can be used to predict the value for this Monday, you should create lag features for seven days. Getting the drift? We can create multiple lag features as well! Let’s say we want lag 1 to lag 7 – we can let the model decide which is the most valuable one. So, if we train a linear regression model, it will assign appropriate weights (or coefficients) to the lag features: lag_seven.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['lag_1'] = data['Count'].shift(1) 6 data = data[['Datetime', 'lag_1', 'Count']] 7 data.head() ‘ The lag value we choose will depend on the correlation of individual values with its past values. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['lag_1'] = data['Count'].shift(1) 6 data['lag_2'] = data['Count'].shift(2) 7 data['lag_3'] = data['Count'].shift(3) 8 data['lag_4'] = data['Count'].shift(4) 9 data['lag_5'] = data['Count'].shift(5) 10 data['lag_6'] = data['Count'].shift(6) 11 data['lag_7'] = data['Count'].shift(7) 12 13 data = data[['Datetime', 'lag_1', 'lag_2', 'lag_3', 'lag_4', 'lag_5', 'lag_6', 'lag_7', 'Count']] 14 data.head(10) There is more than one way of determining the lag at which the correlation is significant. For instance, we can use the ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots. ACF: The ACF plot is a measure of the correlation between the time series and the lagged version of itself PACF: The PACF plot is a measure of the correlation between the time series with a lagged version of itself but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons For our particular example, here are the ACF and PACF plots: from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf plot_acf(data['Count'], lags=10) plot_pacf(data['Count'], lags=10) An important point to note – the number of times you shift, the same number of values will be reduced from the data. You would see some rows with NaNs at the start. That’s because the first observation has no lag. You’ll need to discard these rows from the training data. Feature Engineering for Time Series #4: Rolling Window Feature In the last section, we looked at how we can use the previous values as features. Here’s an awesome gif that explains this idea in a wonderfully intuitive way: ‘ The partial autocorrelation function shows a high correlation with the first lag and lesser correlation with the second and third lag. The autocorrelation function shows a slow decay, which means that the future values have a very high correlation with its past values. ‘ How about calculating some statistical values based on past values? This method is called the rolling window method because the window would be different for every data point. view raw Since this looks like a window that is sliding with every next point, the features generated using this method are called the ‘rolling window’ features. Now the question we need to address – how are we going to perform feature engineering here? Let’s start simple. We will select a window size, take the average of the values in the window, and use it as a feature. Let’s implement it in Python: rolling_mean.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Similarly, you can consider the sum, min, max value, etc. (for the selected window) as a feature and try it out on your own machine. Thus, we can use a weighted average, such that higher weights are given to the most recent observations. Mathematically, weighted average at time t for the past 7 values would be: w_avg = w1*(t-1) + w2*(t-2) + . . . . + w7*(t-7) where, w1>w2>w3> . . . . >w7. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['rolling_mean'] = data['Count'].rolling(window=7).mean() 6 data = data[['Datetime', 'rolling_mean', 'Count']] 7 data.head(10) ‘ Recency in an important factor in a time series. Values closer to the current date would hold more information. view raw Feature Engineering for Time Series #5: Expanding Window Feature This is simply an advanced version of the rolling window technique. In the case of a rolling window, the size of the window is constant while the window slides as we move forward in time. Hence, we consider only the most recent values and ignore the past values. Here’s a gif that explains how our expanding window function works: As you can see, with every step, the size of the window increases by one as it takes into account every new value in the series. This can be implemented easily in Python by using the expanding() function. Let’s code this using the same data: expanding_window.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Here is a live coding window that generates the expanding window feature for the given data. Feel free to change the starting window size and print the results: ‘ The idea behind the expanding window feature is that it takes all the past values into account. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['expanding_mean'] = data['Count'].expanding(2).mean() 6 data = data[['Datetime','Count', 'expanding_mean']] 7 data.head(10) @ L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 / E x p a n din g Win d o w F e a t u r e A P y t h o n r e p l b y L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 O p e n o n R e p lit S h o w c o d e 0 R u n 1 3 L A Feature Engineering for Time Series #6: Domain-Specific Features This is the essence of feature engineering! Want to dive into this more? Let’s take an example. Below is the data provided by a retailer for a number of stores and products. Our task is to forecast the future demands for the products. We can come up with various features, like taking a lag or averaging the past values, among other things. But hold on. Let me ask you a question – would it be the right way to build lag features from lag(1) to lag(7) throughout the data? Certainly not! There are different stores and products, and the demand for each store and product would be significantly different. In this case, we can create lag features considering the store-product combination. Moreover, if we have knowledge about the products and the trends in the market, we would be able to generate more accurate (and fewer) features. Not only this, having a good understanding about the domain and data would help us in selecting the lag value and the window size. Additionally, based on your domain knowledge, you would be able to pull external data that adds more value to the model. Here’s what I mean – are the sales affected by the weather on the day? Will the sales increase/decrease on a national holiday?If yes, then you can use external datasets and include the list of holidays as a feature. Validation Technique for Time Series All the feature engineering techniques we have discussed can be used to convert a time series problem into a supervised machine learning problem. Once we have that, we can easily go ahead with machine learning algorithms like linear regression and random forest. But there is one important step that you should know before you jump to the model building process – creating a validation setfor time series. For the traditional machine learning problems, we randomly select subsets of data for the validation and test sets. But in these cases, each data point is dependent on its past values. If we randomly shuffle the data, we might be training on future data and predicting the past values! ‘ Having a good understanding of the problem statement, clarity of the end objective and knowledge of the available data is essential to engineer domain-specific features for the model. Let’s create a validation set for our problem. But first, we must check the duration for which we have the data: import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') data['Datetime'].min(), data['Datetime'].max(), (data['Datetime'].max() -data['Datetime'].min()) (Timestamp('2012-08-25 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2014-09-25 23:00:00'), Timedelta('761 days 23:00:00')) We have data for almost 25 months. Let’s save three months for validation and use the remaining for training: data.index = data.Datetime Train=data.loc['2012-08-25':'2014-06-24'] valid=data.loc['2014-06-25':'2014-09-25'] Train.shape, valid.shape ((16056, 3), (2232, 3)) Great! We have the train and validation sets ready. You can now use these feature engineering techniques and build machine learning models on this data! Frequently Asked Questions Q1. What are the features oftime series? A. The features of a time series are the characteristics and patterns observed within the data over time. Some of the key features include: 1. Trend: The long-term movement or direction in the data, indicating overall growth or decline. 2. Seasonality: Regular and predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals. 3. Cyclic Patterns: Longer-term oscillations with varying periods, not necessarily repeating at fixed intervals. 4. Noise: Random fluctuations or irregularities in the data that do not follow any specific pattern. 5. Autocorrelation: The correlation of a time series with its own past values at different lags. 6. Level: The baseline or starting point of the time series data. Understanding these features is essential for time series analysis and forecasting. Q2. Whatis time series feature extraction method? A. Time series feature extraction methods involve transforming raw time series data into a set of relevant and informative features. Techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and statistical measures (mean, variance, etc.) are used to extract characteristics such as trend, seasonality, periodicity, and statistical properties. These features are then used for time series analysis, classification, and forecasting tasks. End Notes Time Series is often considered a difficult topic to master. That’s understandable because there are a lot of moving parts when we’re working with the date and time components. But once you have a hang of the basic concepts and are able to perform feature engineering, you’ll be gliding through your projects in no time. In this article, we discussed some simple techniques that you can use to work with time series data. Using these feature engineering techniques, we can convert any time series problem into a supervised learning problem and build regression models. ‘ It is important that we carefully build a validation set when working on a time series problem, without destroying the sequential order within the data.  NNaavviiggaattiioonn Click to Take the FREE Probability Crash-Course Search...   228 How to Use ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves for Classification in Python by Jason Brownlee on October 11, 2023 in Probability It can be more flexible to predict probabilities of an observation belonging to each class in a classification problem rather than predicting classes directly. This flexibility comes from the way that probabilities may be interpreted using different thresholds that allow the operator of the model to trade-off concerns in the errors made by the model, such as the number of false positives compared to the number of false negatives. This is required when using models where the cost of one error outweighs the cost of other types of errors. Two diagnostic tools that help in the interpretation of probabilistic forecast for binary (two-class) classification predictive modeling problems are ROC Curves and Precision-Recall curves. In this tutorial, you will discover ROC Curves, Precision-Recall Curves, and when to use each to interpret the prediction of probabilities for binary classification problems. After completing this tutorial, you will know: ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Kick-start your project with my new book Probability for Machine Learning, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples. Let’s get started.

Update Oct/2023: Minor update on code to make it more Pythonic How and When to Use ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves for Classification in Python Photo by Giuseppe Milo, some rights reserved. Tutorial Overview This tutorial is divided into 6 parts; they are: 1. Predicting Probabilities 2. What Are ROC Curves? 3. ROC Curves and AUC in Python 4. What Are Precision-Recall Curves? 5. Precision-Recall Curves and AUC in Python 6. When to Use ROC vs. Precision-Recall Curves? Predicting Probabilities In a classification problem, we may decide to predict the class values directly. Alternately, it can be more flexible to predict the probabilities for each class instead. The reason for this is to provide the capability to choose and even calibrate the threshold for how to interpret the predicted probabilities. For example, a default might be to use a threshold of 0.5, meaning that a probability in [0.0, 0.49] is a negative outcome (0) and a probability in [0.5, 1.0] is a positive outcome (1). This threshold can be adjusted to tune the behavior of the model for a specific problem. An example would be to reduce more of one or another type of error. When making a prediction for a binary or two-class classification problem, there are two types of errors that we could make. False Positive. Predict an event when there was no event. False Negative. Predict no event when in fact there was an event. By predicting probabilities and calibrating a threshold, a balance of these two concerns can be chosen by the operator of the model. For example, in a smog prediction system, we may be far more concerned with having low false negatives than low false positives. A false negative would mean not warning about a smog day when in fact it is a high smog day, leading to health issues in the public that are unable to take precautions. A false positive means the public would take precautionary measures when they didn’t need to. A common way to compare models that predict probabilities for two-class problems is to use a ROC curve. What Are ROC Curves? A useful tool when predicting the probability of a binary outcome is the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, or ROC curve. It is a plot of the false positive rate (x-axis) versus the true positive rate (y-axis) for a number of different candidate threshold values between 0.0 and 1.0. Put another way, it plots the false alarm rate versus the hit rate. The true positive rate is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false negatives. It describes how good the model is at predicting the positive class when the actual outcome is positive. The true positive rate is also referred to as sensitivity. The false positive rate is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the sum of the number of false positives and the number of true negatives. It is also called the false alarm rate as it summarizes how often a positive class is predicted when the actual outcome is negative. 1 True Positive Rate = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 False Positive Rate = False Positives / (False Positives + True Negatives) The false positive rate is also referred to as the inverted specificity where specificity is the total number of true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and false positives. Where: The ROC curve is a useful tool for a few reasons: The curves of different models can be compared directly in general or for different thresholds. The area under the curve (AUC) can be used as a summary of the model skill. The shape of the curve contains a lot of information, including what we might care about most for a problem, the expected false positive rate, and the false negative rate. To make this clear: Smaller values on the x-axis of the plot indicate lower false positives and higher true negatives. Larger values on the y-axis of the plot indicate higher true positives and lower false negatives. If you are confused, remember, when we predict a binary outcome, it is either a correct prediction (true positive) or not (false positive). There is a tension between these options, the same with true negative and false negative. A skilful model will assign a higher probability to a randomly chosen real positive occurrence than a negative occurrence on average. This is what we mean when we say that the model has skill. Generally, skilful models are represented by curves that bow up to the top left of the plot. A no-skill classifier is one that cannot discriminate between the classes and would predict a random class or a constant class in all cases. A model with no skill is represented at the point (0.5, 0.5). A model with no skill at each threshold is represented by a diagonal line from the bottom left of the plot to the top right and has an AUC of 0.5. A model with perfect skill is represented at a point (0,1). A model with perfect skill is represented by a line that travels from the bottom left of the plot to the top left and then across the top to the top right. An operator may plot the ROC curve for the final model and choose a threshold that gives a desirable balance between the false positives and false negatives.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course 1 Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives) 1 False Positive Rate = 1 - Specificity ROC Curves and AUC in Python We can plot a ROC curve for a model in Python using the roc_curve() scikit-learn function. The function takes both the true outcomes (0,1) from the test set and the predicted probabilities for the 1 class. The function returns the false positive rates for each threshold, true positive rates for each threshold and thresholds. The AUC for the ROC can be calculated using the roc_auc_score() function. Like the roc_curve() function, the AUC function takes both the true outcomes (0,1) from the test set and the predicted probabilities for the 1 class. It returns the AUC score between 0.0 and 1.0 for no skill and perfect skill respectively. A complete example of calculating the ROC curve and ROC AUC for a Logistic Regression model on a small test problem is listed below. 1 2 3 ... # calculate roc curve fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y, probs) 1 2 3 4 ... # calculate AUC auc = roc_auc_score(y, probs) print('AUC: %.3f' % auc) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # roc curve and auc from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # generate a no skill prediction (majority class) ns_probs = [0 for _ in range(len(testy))] # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # calculate scores ns_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, ns_probs) lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs) # summarize scores print('No Skill: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (ns_auc)) print('Logistic: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (lr_auc)) # calculate roc curves ns_fpr, ns_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, ns_probs) lr_fpr, lr_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, lr_probs) # plot the roc curve for the model plt.plot(ns_fpr, ns_tpr, linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_fpr, lr_tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels Running the example prints the ROC AUC for the logistic regression model and the no skill classifier that only predicts 0 for all examples. A plot of the ROC curve for the model is also created showing that the model has skill. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. ROC Curve Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model What Are Precision-Recall Curves? There are many ways to evaluate the skill of a prediction model. An approach in the related field of information retrieval (finding documents based on queries) measures precision and recall. 35 36 37 38 39 40 plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 2 No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 Logistic: ROC AUC=0.903 These measures are also useful in applied machine learning for evaluating binary classification models. Precision is a ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and false positives. It describes how good a model is at predicting the positive class. Precision is referred to as the positive predictive value. or Recall is calculated as the ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and the false negatives. Recall is the same as sensitivity. or Reviewing both precision and recall is useful in cases where there is an imbalance in the observations between the two classes. Specifically, there are many examples of no event (class 0) and only a few examples of an event (class 1). The reason for this is that typically the large number of class 0 examples means we are less interested in the skill of the model at predicting class 0 correctly, e.g. high true negatives. Key to the calculation of precision and recall is that the calculations do not make use of the true negatives. It is only concerned with the correct prediction of the minority class, class 1. A precision-recall curve is a plot of the precision (y-axis) and the recall (x-axis) for different thresholds, much like the ROC curve. A no-skill classifier is one that cannot discriminate between the classes and would predict a random class or a constant class in all cases. The no-skill line changes based on the distribution of the positive to negative classes. It is a horizontal line with the value of the ratio of positive cases in the dataset. For a balanced dataset, this is 0.5. — The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets, 2015. A model with perfect skill is depicted as a point at (1,1). A skilful model is represented by a curve that bows towards (1,1) above the flat line of no skill. While the baseline is fixed with ROC, the baseline of [precision-recall curve] is determined by the ratio of positives (P) and negatives (N) as y = P / (P + N). For instance, we have y = 0.5 for a balanced class distribution …  1 Positive Predictive Power = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) 1 Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) 1 Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Recall == Sensitivity There are also composite scores that attempt to summarize the precision and recall; two examples include: F-Measure or F1 score: that calculates the harmonic mean of the precision and recall (harmonic mean because the precision and recall are rates). Area Under Curve: like the AUC, summarizes the integral or an approximation of the area under the precision-recall curve. In terms of model selection, F-Measure summarizes model skill for a specific probability threshold (e.g. 0.5), whereas the area under curve summarize the skill of a model across thresholds, like ROC AUC. This makes precision-recall and a plot of precision vs. recall and summary measures useful tools for binary classification problems that have an imbalance in the observations for each class. Precision-Recall Curves in Python Precision and recall can be calculated in scikit-learn. The precision and recall can be calculated for thresholds using the precision_recall_curve() function that takes the true output values and the probabilities for the positive class as input and returns the precision, recall and threshold values. The F-Measure can be calculated by calling the f1_score() function that takes the true class values and the predicted class values as arguments. The area under the precision-recall curve can be approximated by calling the auc() function and passing it the recall (x) and precision (y) values calculated for each threshold. When plotting precision and recall for each threshold as a curve, it is important that recall is provided as the x-axis and precision is provided as the y-axis. The complete example of calculating precision-recall curves for a Logistic Regression model is listed below. 1 2 3 ... # calculate precision-recall curve precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, probs) 1 2 3 ... # calculate F1 score f1 = f1_score(testy, yhat) 1 2 3 ... # calculate precision-recall AUC auc = auc(recall, precision) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # precision-recall curve and f1 from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve from sklearn.metrics import f1_score from sklearn.metrics import auc Running the example first prints the F1, area under curve (AUC) for the logistic regression model. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. The precision-recall curve plot is then created showing the precision/recall for each threshold for a logistic regression model (orange) compared to a no skill model (blue). 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # predict class values yhat = model.predict(testX) lr_precision, lr_recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(testy, lr_probs) lr_f1, lr_auc = f1_score(testy, yhat), auc(lr_recall, lr_precision) # summarize scores print('Logistic: f1=%.3f auc=%.3f' % (lr_f1, lr_auc)) # plot the precision-recall curves no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) plt.plot([0, 1], [no_skill, no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_recall, lr_precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('Recall') plt.ylabel('Precision') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 Logistic: f1=0.841 auc=0.898 Precision-Recall Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model When to Use ROC vs. Precision-Recall Curves? Generally, the use of ROC curves and precision-recall curves are as follows: ROC curves should be used when there are roughly equal numbers of observations for each class. Precision-Recall curves should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance. The reason for this recommendation is that ROC curves present an optimistic picture of the model on datasets with a class imbalance. — The Relationship Between Precision-Recall and ROC Curves, 2006. Some go further and suggest that using a ROC curve with an imbalanced dataset might be deceptive and lead to incorrect interpretations of the model skill. However, ROC curves can present an overly optimistic view of an algorithm’s performance if there is a large skew in the class distribution. […] Precision-Recall (PR) curves, often used in Information Retrieval , have been cited as an alternative to ROC curves for tasks with a large skew in the class distribution.  — The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets, 2015. The main reason for this optimistic picture is because of the use of true negatives in the False Positive Rate in the ROC Curve and the careful avoidance of this rate in the Precision-Recall curve. — ROC Graphs: Notes and Practical Considerations for Data Mining Researchers, 2003. We can make this concrete with a short example. Below is the same ROC Curve example with a modified problem where there is a ratio of about 100:1 ratio of class=0 to class=1 observations (specifically Class0=985, Class1=15). […] the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. [Precision-recall curve] plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions  If the proportion of positive to negative instances changes in a test set, the ROC curves will not change. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, lift and F scores use values from both columns of the confusion matrix. As a class distribution changes these measures will change as well, even if the fundamental classifier performance does not. ROC graphs are based upon TP rate and FP rate, in which each dimension is a strict columnar ratio, so do not depend on class distributions.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # roc curve and auc on an imbalanced dataset from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, weights=[0.99,0.01], random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # generate a no skill prediction (majority class) ns_probs = [0 for _ in range(len(testy))] # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # calculate scores ns_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, ns_probs) lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs) # summarize scores print('No Skill: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (ns_auc)) print('Logistic: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (lr_auc)) # calculate roc curves Running the example suggests that the model has skill. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. Indeed, it has skill, but all of that skill is measured as making correct true negative predictions and there are a lot of negative predictions to make. If you review the predictions, you will see that the model predicts the majority class (class 0) in all cases on the test set. The score is very misleading. A plot of the ROC Curve confirms the AUC interpretation of a skilful model for most probability thresholds. 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 ns_fpr, ns_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, ns_probs) lr_fpr, lr_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, lr_probs) # plot the roc curve for the model plt.plot(ns_fpr, ns_tpr, linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_fpr, lr_tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 2 No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 Logistic: ROC AUC=0.716 ROC Curve Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model for an Imbalanced Dataset We can also repeat the test of the same model on the same dataset and calculate a precision-recall curve and statistics instead.

Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. We can see that the model is penalized for predicting the majority class in all cases. The scores show that the model that looked good according to the ROC Curve is in fact barely skillful when considered using using precision and recall that focus on the positive class. The plot of the precision-recall curve highlights that the model is just barely above the no skill line for most thresholds. This is possible because the model predicts probabilities and is uncertain about some cases. These get exposed through the different thresholds evaluated in the construction of the curve, flipping some class 0 to class 1, offering some precision but very low recall. 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 lr_f1, lr_auc = f1_score(testy, yhat), auc(lr_recall, lr_precision) # summarize scores print('Logistic: f1=%.3f auc=%.3f' % (lr_f1, lr_auc)) # plot the precision-recall curves no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) plt.plot([0, 1], [no_skill, no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_recall, lr_precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('Recall') plt.ylabel('Precision') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 Logistic: f1=0.000 auc=0.054 Precision-Recall Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model for am Imbalanced Dataset Further Reading This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper.

Specifically, you learned: ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Do you have any questions?

Nevertheless, many machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting a probability or scoring of class membership, and this must be interpreted before it can be mapped to a crisp class label. This is achieved by using a threshold, such as 0.5, where all values equal or greater than the threshold are mapped to one class and all other values are mapped to another class. For those classification problems that have a severe class imbalance, the default threshold can result in poor performance. As such, a simple and straightforward approach to improving the performance of a classifier that predicts probabilities on an imbalanced classification problem is to tune the threshold used to map probabilities to class labels. In some cases, such as when using ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves, the best or optimal threshold for the classifier can be calculated directly. In other cases, it is possible to use a grid search to tune the threshold and locate the optimal value. In this tutorial, you will discover how to tune the optimal threshold when converting probabilities to crisp class labels for imbalanced classification. After completing this tutorial, you will know: The default threshold for interpreting probabilities to class labels is 0.5, and tuning this hyperparameter is called threshold moving. How to calculate the optimal threshold for the ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve directly. How to manually search threshold values for a chosen model and model evaluation metric.

Converting Probabilities to Class Labels 2. Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification 3. Optimal Threshold for ROC Curve 4. Optimal Threshold for Precision-Recall Curve 5. Optimal Threshold Tuning Converting Probabilities to Class Labels × Many machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting a probability or a scoring of class membership. This is useful generally as it provides a measure of the certainty or uncertainty of a prediction. It also provides additional granularity over just predicting the class label that can be interpreted. Some classification tasks require a crisp class label prediction. This means that even though a probability or scoring of class membership is predicted, it must be converted into a crisp class label. The decision for converting a predicted probability or scoring into a class label is governed by a parameter referred to as the “decision threshold,” “discrimination threshold,” or simply the “threshold.” The default value for the threshold is 0.5 for normalized predicted probabilities or scores in the range between 0 or 1. For example, on a binary classification problem with class labels 0 and 1, normalized predicted probabilities and a threshold of 0.5, then values less than the threshold of 0.5 are assigned to class 0 and values greater than or equal to 0.5 are assigned to class 1. Prediction < 0.5 = Class 0 Prediction >= 0.5 = Class 1 The problem is that the default threshold may not represent an optimal interpretation of the predicted probabilities. This might be the case for a number of reasons, such as: The predicted probabilities are not calibrated, e.g. those predicted by an SVM or decision tree. The metric used to train the model is different from the metric used to evaluate a final model. The class distribution is severely skewed. The cost of one type of misclassification is more important than another type of misclassification. Worse still, some or all of these reasons may occur at the same time, such as the use of a neural network model with uncalibrated predicted probabilities on an imbalanced classification problem. As such, there is often the need to change the default decision threshold when interpreting the predictions of a model. — Page 53, Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets, 2018.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification There are many techniques that may be used to address an imbalanced classification problem, such as resampling the training dataset and developing customized version of machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, perhaps the simplest approach to handle a severe class imbalance is to change the decision threshold. Although simple and very effective, this technique is often overlooked by practitioners and research academics alike as was noted by Foster Provost in his 2000 article titled “Machine Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets.” — Machine Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets 101, 2000. There are many reasons to choose an alternative to the default decision threshold. For example, you may use ROC curves to analyze the predicted probabilities of a model and ROC AUC scores to compare and select a model, although you require crisp class labels from your model. How do you choose the threshold on the ROC Curve that results in the best balance between the true positive rate and the false positive rate? Alternately, you may use precision-recall curves to analyze the predicted probabilities of a model, precision-recall AUC to compare and select models, and require crisp class labels as predictions. How do you choose the threshold on the Precision-Recall Curve that results in the best balance between precision and recall? You may use a probability-based metric to train, evaluate, and compare models like log loss (crossentropy) but require crisp class labels to be predicted. How do you choose the optimal threshold from predicted probabilities more generally? Finally, you may have different costs associated with false positive and false negative misclassification, a so-called cost matrix, but wish to use and evaluate cost-insensitive models and later evaluate their predictions use a cost-sensitive measure. How do you choose a threshold that finds the best trade-off for predictions using the cost matrix? The bottom line is that when studying problems with imbalanced data, using the classifiers produced by standard machine learning algorithms without adjusting the output threshold may well be a critical mistake.  × — Page 67, Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets, 2018. The answer to these questions is to search a range of threshold values in order to find the best threshold. In some cases, the optimal threshold can be calculated directly. Tuning or shifting the decision threshold in order to accommodate the broader requirements of the classification problem is generally referred to as “threshold-moving,” “threshold-tuning,” or simply “thresholding.” — Pages 72, Imbalanced Learning: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications, 2013. The process involves first fitting the model on a training dataset and making predictions on a test dataset. The predictions are in the form of normalized probabilities or scores that are transformed into normalized probabilities. Different threshold values are then tried and the resulting crisp labels are evaluated using a chosen evaluation metric. The threshold that achieves the best evaluation metric is then adopted for the model when making predictions on new data in the future. We can summarize this procedure below. 1. Fit Model on the Training Dataset. 2. Predict Probabilities on the Test Dataset. 3. For each threshold in Thresholds: 3a. Convert probabilities to Class Labels using the threshold. 3b. Evaluate Class Labels. 3c. If Score is Better than Best Score. 3ci. Adopt Threshold. 4. Use Adopted Threshold When Making Class Predictions on New Data. Although simple, there are a few different approaches to implementing threshold-moving depending on your circumstance. We will take a look at some of the most common examples in the following sections. Popular way of training a cost-sensitive classifier without a known cost matrix is to put emphasis on modifying the classification outputs when predictions are being made on new data. This is usually done by setting a threshold on the positive class, below which the negative one is being predicted. The value of this threshold is optimized using a validation set and thus the cost matrix can be learned from training data.  It has been stated that trying other methods, such as sampling, without trying by simply setting the threshold may be misleading. The threshold-moving method uses the original training set to train [a model] and then moves the decision threshold such that the minority class examples are easier to be predicted correctly.  × Optimal Threshold for ROC Curve A ROC curve is a diagnostic plot that evaluates a set of probability predictions made by a model on a test dataset. A set of different thresholds are used to interpret the true positive rate and the false positive rate of the predictions on the positive (minority) class, and the scores are plotted in a line of increasing thresholds to create a curve. The false-positive rate is plotted on the x-axis and the true positive rate is plotted on the y-axis and the plot is referred to as the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, or ROC curve. A diagonal line on the plot from the bottom-left to top-right indicates the “curve” for a no-skill classifier (predicts the majority class in all cases), and a point in the top left of the plot indicates a model with perfect skill. The curve is useful to understand the trade-off in the true-positive rate and false-positive rate for different thresholds. The area under the ROC Curve, so-called ROC AUC, provides a single number to summarize the performance of a model in terms of its ROC Curve with a value between 0.5 (no-skill) and 1.0 (perfect skill). The ROC Curve is a useful diagnostic tool for understanding the trade-off for different thresholds and the ROC AUC provides a useful number for comparing models based on their general capabilities. If crisp class labels are required from a model under such an analysis, then an optimal threshold is required. This would be a threshold on the curve that is closest to the top-left of the plot. Thankfully, there are principled ways of locating this point. First, let’s fit a model and calculate a ROC Curve. We can use the make_classification() function to create a synthetic binary classification problem with 10,000 examples (rows), 99 percent of which belong to the majority class and 1 percent belong to the minority class. We can then split the dataset using the train_test_split() function and use half for the training set and half for the test set. We can then fit a LogisticRegression model and use it to make probability predictions on the test set and keep only the probability predictions for the minority class. 1 2 3 4 ... # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) 1 2 3 ... # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratify 1 2 3 4 ... # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) × We can then use the roc_auc_score() function to calculate the true-positive rate and false-positive rate for the predictions using a set of thresholds that can then be used to create a ROC Curve plot. We can tie this all together, defining the dataset, fitting the model, and creating the ROC Curve plot. The complete example is listed below. Running the example fits a logistic regression model on the training dataset then evaluates it using a range of thresholds on the test set, creating the ROC Curve We can see that there are a number of points or thresholds close to the top-left of the plot. Which is the threshold that is optimal? 5 6 7 8 # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] 1 2 3 ... # calculate scores lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs)","output":"The optimal threshold for the ROC curve is the point on the curve that is closest to the top-left corner, which maximizes the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate. To find the optimal threshold, you can calculate the distance of each threshold point on the ROC curve from the top-left corner (0,1) and choose the threshold with the smallest distance. This can be done by calculating the Euclidean distance for each point, which is given by the formula: \`\`\` distance = sqrt((1 - true_positive_rate)**2 + (false_positive_rate)**2) \`\`\` The threshold corresponding to the point with the smallest distance is considered the optimal threshold. Alternatively, you can use the \`roc_curve\` function from the scikit-learn library in Python to obtain the false positive rates, true positive rates, and thresholds that form the ROC curve. Then, loop through the thresholds and calculate the distance for each point, finally selecting the threshold with the smallest distance. Here is an example code snippet to find the optimal threshold using scikit-learn: \`\`\`python from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from numpy import sqrt, argmin # Assuming you have true labels 'testy' and predicted probabilities 'lr_probs' fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, lr_probs) # Calculate the G-mean for each threshold gmeans = sqrt(tpr * (1-fpr)) # Locate the index of the largest G-mean ix = argmin(gmeans) optimal_threshold = thresholds[ix] print(f'Optimal Threshold: {optimal_threshold}') \`\`\` In the code above, we calculate the G-mean, which is the geometric mean of the true positive rate and the inverse of the false positive rate. We then find the index of the largest G-mean, which gives us the optimal threshold. Remember that the optimal threshold can vary depending on your specific classification problem, the cost of misclassification errors, and the class distribution in your dataset. You may need to evaluate various threshold-dependent metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) to determine the most appropriate threshold for your use case."},{"instruction":"create a list of all the topic of the content i sent you before","output":"Based on the content provided in your previous messages, here is a list of the topics covered: 1.

Firstly, the true positive rate is called the Sensitivity. The inverse of the false-positive rate is called the Specificity. Sensitivity = TruePositive / (TruePositive + FalseNegative) Specificity = TrueNegative / (FalsePositive + TrueNegative) Where: Sensitivity = True Positive Rate Specificity = 1 – False Positive Rate The Geometric Mean or G-Mean is a metric for imbalanced classification that, if optimized, will seek a balance between the sensitivity and the specificity. G-Mean = sqrt(Sensitivity * Specificity) One approach would be to test the model with each threshold returned from the call roc_auc_score() and select the threshold with the largest G-Mean value. × Given that we have already calculated the Sensitivity (TPR) and the complement to the Specificity when we calculated the ROC Curve, we can calculate the G-Mean for each threshold directly. Once calculated, we can locate the index for the largest G-mean score and use that index to determine which threshold value to use. We can also re-draw the ROC Curve and highlight this point. The complete example is listed below. Running the example first locates the optimal threshold and reports this threshold and the G-Mean score. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. 1 2 3 ... # calculate the g-mean for each threshold gmeans = sqrt(tpr * (1-fpr)) 1 2 3 4 ... # locate the index of the largest g-mean ix = argmax(gmeans) print('Best Threshold=%f, G-Mean=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], gmeans[ix])) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # roc curve for logistic regression model with optimal threshold from numpy import sqrt from numpy import argmax from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from matplotlib import pyplot # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate roc curves fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, yhat) # calculate the g-mean for each threshold gmeans = sqrt(tpr * (1-fpr)) # locate the index of the largest g-mean ix = argmax(gmeans) print('Best Threshold=%f, G-Mean=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], gmeans[ix])) # plot the roc curve for the model pyplot.plot([0,1], [0,1], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') pyplot.plot(fpr, tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') pyplot.scatter(fpr[ix], tpr[ix], marker='o', color='black', label='Best') # axis labels pyplot.xlabel('False Positive Rate') pyplot.ylabel('True Positive Rate') pyplot.legend() # show the plot pyplot.show() × In this case, we can see that the optimal threshold is about 0.016153. The threshold is then used to locate the true and false positive rates, then this point is drawn on the ROC Curve. We can see that the point for the optimal threshold is a large black dot and it appears to be closest to the top-left of the plot. ROC Curve Line Plot for Logistic Regression Model for Imbalanced Classification With the Optimal Threshold It turns out there is a much faster way to get the same result, called the Youden’s J statistic. The statistic is calculated as: J = Sensitivity + Specificity – 1 Given that we have Sensitivity (TPR) and the complement of the specificity (FPR), we can calculate it as: J = Sensitivity + (1 – FalsePositiveRate) – 1 Which we can restate as: J = TruePositiveRate – FalsePositiveRate 1 Best Threshold=0.016153, G-Mean=0.933 × We can then choose the threshold with the largest J statistic value. For example: Plugging this in, the complete example is listed below. We can see that this simpler approach calculates the optimal statistic directly. Optimal Threshold for Precision-Recall Curve Unlike the ROC Curve, a precision-recall curve focuses on the performance of a classifier on the positive (minority class) only. Precision is the ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and false positives. It describes how good a model is at predicting the positive class. Recall is calculated as the ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and the false negatives. Recall is the same as sensitivity. A precision-recall curve is calculated by creating crisp class labels for probability predictions across a set of thresholds and calculating the precision and recall for each threshold. A line plot is created for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... # calculate roc curves fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, yhat) # get the best threshold J = tpr - fpr ix = argmax(J) best_thresh = thresholds[ix] print('Best Threshold=%f' % (best_thresh)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 # roc curve for logistic regression model with optimal threshold from numpy import argmax from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate roc curves fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, yhat) # get the best threshold J = tpr - fpr ix = argmax(J) best_thresh = thresholds[ix] print('Best Threshold=%f' % (best_thresh)) 1 Best Threshold=0.016153 × the thresholds in ascending order with recall on the x-axis and precision on the y-axis. A no-skill model is represented by a horizontal line with a precision that is the ratio of positive examples in the dataset (e.g. TP / (TP + TN)), or 0.01 on our synthetic dataset. perfect skill classifier has full precision and recall with a dot in the top-right corner. We can use the same model and dataset from the previous section and evaluate the probability predictions for a logistic regression model using a precision-recall curve. The precision_recall_curve() function can be used to calculate the curve, returning the precision and recall scores for each threshold as well as the thresholds used. Tying this together, the complete example of calculating a precision-recall curve for a logistic regression on an imbalanced classification problem is listed below. Running the example calculates the precision and recall for each threshold and creates a precisionrecall plot showing that the model has some skill across a range of thresholds on this dataset. If we required crisp class labels from this model, which threshold would achieve the best result? 1 2 3 ... # calculate pr-curve precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, yhat) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 # pr curve for logistic regression model from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve from matplotlib import pyplot # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate pr-curve precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, yhat) # plot the roc curve for the model no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) pyplot.plot([0,1], [no_skill,no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') pyplot.plot(recall, precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels pyplot.xlabel('Recall') pyplot.ylabel('Precision') pyplot.legend() # show the plot pyplot.show() × Precision-Recall Curve Line Plot for Logistic Regression Model for Imbalanced Classification If we are interested in a threshold that results in the best balance of precision and recall, then this is the same as optimizing the F-measure that summarizes the harmonic mean of both measures. F-Measure = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) As in the previous section, the naive approach to finding the optimal threshold would be to calculate the F-measure for each threshold. We can achieve the same effect by converting the precision and recall measures to F-measure directly; for example: We can then plot the point on the precision-recall curve. The complete example is listed below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... # convert to f score fscore = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall) # locate the index of the largest f score ix = argmax(fscore) print('Best Threshold=%f, F-Score=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], fscore[ix])) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # optimal threshold for precision-recall curve with logistic regression model from numpy import argmax from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve from matplotlib import pyplot × Running the example first calculates the F-measure for each threshold, then locates the score and threshold with the largest value. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. In this case, we can see that the best F-measure was 0.756 achieved with a threshold of about 0.25. The precision-recall curve is plotted, and this time the threshold with the optimal F-measure is plotted with a larger black dot. This threshold could then be used when making probability predictions in the future that must be converted from probabilities to crisp class labels. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate roc curves precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, yhat) # convert to f score fscore = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall) # locate the index of the largest f score ix = argmax(fscore) print('Best Threshold=%f, F-Score=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], fscore[ix])) # plot the roc curve for the model no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) pyplot.plot([0,1], [no_skill,no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') pyplot.plot(recall, precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') pyplot.scatter(recall[ix], precision[ix], marker='o', color='black', label='Best') # axis labels pyplot.xlabel('Recall') pyplot.ylabel('Precision') pyplot.legend() # show the plot pyplot.show() 1 Best Threshold=0.256036, F-Score=0.756 × Precision-Recall Curve Line Plot for Logistic Regression Model With Optimal Threshold Optimal Threshold Tuning Sometimes, we simply have a model and we wish to know the best threshold directly. In this case, we can define a set of thresholds and then evaluate predicted probabilities under each in order to find and select the optimal threshold. We can demonstrate this with a worked example. First, we can fit a logistic regression model on our synthetic classification problem, then predict class labels and evaluate them using the F-Measure, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. This will use the default threshold of 0.5 when interpreting the probabilities predicted by the logistic regression model.

Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. Running the example, we can see that the model achieved an F-Measure of about 0.70 on the test dataset. Now we can use the same model on the same dataset and instead of predicting class labels directly, we can predict probabilities. We only require the probabilities for the positive class. Next, we can then define a set of thresholds to evaluate the probabilities. In this case, we will test all thresholds between 0.0 and 1.0 with a step size of 0.001, that is, we will test 0.0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, and so on to 0.999. Next, we need a way of using a single threshold to interpret the predicted probabilities. This can be achieved by mapping all values equal to or greater than the threshold to 1 and all values less than the threshold to 0. We will define a to_labels() function to do this that will take the probabilities and threshold as an argument and return an array of integers in {0, 1}. We can then call this function for each threshold and evaluate the resulting labels using the f1_score().","output":"Based on the new content provided, here is a list of the topics covered: - ROC Curve for Logistic Regression Model 1.

Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18.

Here, assume n di↵erent classifiers, {h1, h2, ..., hm} where hi(x)=ˆyi. In lecture 2, (Nearest Neighbor Methods) we learned that the majority (or plurality) voting can simply be expressed as the mode: yˆf = mode{h1(x), h2(x), ...hn(x)}. (1) The following illustration demonstrates why majority voting can be e↵ective (under certain assumptions). • Given are n independent classifiers (h1, ..., hn) with a base error rate ✏. • Here, independent means that the errors are uncorrelated • Assume a binary classification task Assuming the error rate is better than random guessing (i.e., lower than 0.5 for binary classification), 8✏i 2 {✏1, ✏2, ..., ✏n}, ✏i < 0.5, (2) the error of the ensemble can be computed using a binomial probability distribution since the ensemble makes a wrong prediction if more than 50% of the n classifiers make a wrong prediction. The probability that we make a wrong prediction via the ensemble if k classifiers predict the same class label (where k > dn/2e because of majority voting ) is then P(k) = ✓n k ◆ ✏ k(1 ✏) nk, (3) where n k is the binomial coecient ✓n k ◆ = n! (n k)!k! . (4) Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 3 However, we need to consider all cases k 2 {dn/2e, ..., n} (cumulative prob. distribution) to compute the ensemble error ✏ens = Xn k ✓n k ◆ ✏ k(1 ✏) nk. (5) Consider the following example with n=11 and ✏ = 0.25, where the ensemble error decreases substantially compared to the error rate of the individual models: ✏ens = X 11 k=6 ✓11 k ◆ 0.25k(1 0.25)11k = 0.034. (6) Figure 3: error-rate 7.3 Soft Majority Voting For well calibrated classifiers we can also use the predicted class membership probabilities to infer the class label, yˆ = arg maxj Xn i=1 wipi,j , (7) where pi,j is the predicted class membership probability for class label j by the ith classifier. Here wi is an optional weighting parameter. If we set wi = 1/n, 8wi 2 {w1, ..., wn} then all probabilities are weighted uniformly. To illustrate this, let us assume we have a binary classification problem with class labels j 2 {0, 1} and an ensemble of three classifiers hi(i 2 {1, 2, 3}): h1(x) ! [0.9, 0.1], h2(x) ! [0.8, 0.2], h3(x) ! [0.4, 0.6]. (8) We can then calculate the individual class membership probabilities as follows: Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 4 p(j = 0|x)=0.2·0.9+0.2·0.8+0.6·0.4=0.58, p(j = 1|x)=0.2·0.1+0.2·0.2+0.6·0.6=0.42. (9) The predicted class label is then yˆ = arg maxj ⇢ p(j = 0|x), p(j = 1|x) = 0. (10) 7.4 Bagging • Bagging relies on a concept similar to majority voting but uses the same learning algorithm (typically a decision tree algorithm) to fit models on di↵erent subsets of the training data (bootstrap samples). • Bagging can improve the accuracy of unstable models that tend to overfit2.

Low Variance (Precise) High Variance (Not Precise) Low Bias (Accurate) High Bias (Not Accurate) Figure 9: Bias and variance intuition. • One can say that individual, unpruned decision tree “have high variance” (in this context, the individual decision trees “tend to overfit”); a bagging model has a lower Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 7 variance than the individual trees and is less prone to overfitting – again, bias and variance decomposition will be discussed in more detail next lecture. 7.6 Boosting • There are two broad categories of boosting: Adaptive boosting and gradient boosting. • Adaptive and gradient boosting rely on the same concept of boosting “weak learners” (such as decision tree stumps) to “strong learners.” • Boosting is an iterative process, where the training set is reweighted, at each iteration, based on mistakes a weak leaner made (i.e., misclassifications); the two approaches, adaptive and gradient boosting, di↵er mainly regarding how the weights are updated and how the classifiers are combined. • Since we have not discussed gradient-based optimization, in this lecture, we will focus on adaptive boosting. • In particular, we will focus on AdaBoost as initially described by Freund and Schapire in 19973. • If you are familiar with gradient-based optimization and interested in gradient boosting, I recommend reading Friedman’s work4 and the more recent paper on XGBoost5, which is essentially a computationally ecient implementation of the original gradient boost algorithm. 37 General Boosting Training Sample Weighted Training Sample Weighted Training Sample h1(x) h2(x) hm(x) hm(x) = sign ( m ∑ j=1 wj hj (x) ) hm(x) = arg maxi ( m ∑ j=1 wj I[hj (x) = i] ) for h(x) {1,1} or for h(x) = i, i {1,...,n} Figure 10: A general outline of the boosting procedure for n iterations. Intuitively, we can outline the general boosting procedure as follows: • Initialize a weight vector with uniform weights 3Yoav Freund and Robert E Schapire. “A decision-theoretic generalization of on-line learning and an application to boosting”.

The size of the symbols (circles shall represent training examples from one class, and triangles shall represent training examples from another class) is proportional to the weighting of the training examples at each round. The 4th subpanel shows a combination/ensemble of the hypotheses from subpanels 1-3. Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 9 7.7 Random Forests 7.7.1 Overview • Random forests are among the most widely used machine learning algorithm, probably due to their relatively good performance “out of the box” and ease of use (not much tuning required to get good results). • In the context of bagging, random forests are relatively easy to understand conceptually: the random forest algorithm can be understood as bagging with decision trees, but instead of growing the decision trees by basing the splitting criterion on the complete feature set, we use random feature subsets. • To summarize, in random forests, we fit decision trees on di↵erent bootstrap samples, and in addition, for each decision tree, we select a random subset of features at each node to decide upon the optimal split; while the size of the feature subset to consider at each node is a hyperparameter that we can tune, a “rule-of-thumb” suggestion is to use NumFeatures = log2 m + 1. 7.7.2 Does random forest select a subset of features for every tree or every node? Earlier random decision forests by Tin Kam Ho6 used the “random subspace method,” where each tree got a random subset of features. “The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space.” – Tin Kam Ho However, a few years later, Leo Breiman described the procedure of selecting di↵erent subsets of features for each node (while a tree was given the full set of features) — Leo Breiman’s formulation has become the “trademark” random forest algorithm that we typically refer to these days when we speak of “random forest7:” “. . . random forest with random features is formed by selecting at random, at each node, a small group of input variables to split on.” 7.7.3 Generalization Error • The reason why random forests may work better in practice than a regular bagging model, for example, may be explained by the additional randomization that further diversifies the individual trees (i.e., decorrelates them). • In Breiman’s random forest paper, the upper bound of the generalization error is given as PE  ⇢¯ · (1 s2) s2 , (14) where ¯⇢ is the average correlation among trees and s measures the strength of the trees as classifiers. I.e., the average predictive performance concerning the classifiers’ margin. We 6Tin Kam Ho. “Random decision forests”. In: Document analysis and recognition, 1995., proceedings of the third international conference on. Vol. 1. IEEE. 1995, pp. 278–282. 7Leo Breiman. “Random forests”. In: Machine learning 45.1 (2001), pp. 5–32. Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 10 do not need to get into the details of how ¯p and s are calculated to get an intuition for their relationship. I.e., the lower correlation, the lower the error. Similarly, the higher the strength of the ensemble or trees, the lower the error. So, randomization of the feature subspaces may decrease the “strength” of the individual trees, but at the same time, it reduces the correlation of the trees. Then, compared to bagging, random forests may be at the sweet spot where the correlation and strength decreases result in a better net result. 7.7.4 Feature Importance via Random Forests While random forests are naturally less interpretable than individual decision trees, where we can trace a decision via a rule sets, it is possible (and common) to compute the so-called “feature importance” of the inputs – that means, we can infer how important a feature is for the overall prediction. However, this is a topic that will be discussed later in the “Feature Selection” lecture. 7.7.5 Extremely Randomized Trees (ExtraTrees) • A few years after random forests were developed, an even “more random” procedure was developed called Extremely Randomized Trees8. • Compared to regular random forests, the ExtraTrees algorithm selects a random feature at each decision tree nodes for splitting; hence, it is very fast because there is no information gain computation and feature comparison step. • Intuitively, one might say that ExtraTrees have another “random component” (compared to random forests) to further reduce the correlation among trees – however, it might decrease the strength of the individual trees (if you think back of the generalization error bound discussed in the previous section on random forests). 7.8 Stacking 7.8.1 Overview • Stacking9 is a special case of ensembling where we combine an ensemble of models through a so-called meta-classifier. • In general, in stacking, we have “base learners” that learn from the initial training set, and the resulting models then make predictions that serve as input features to a “meta-learner.” 8geurts2006extremel. 9wolpert1992stacked.

Note that here, in contrast to majority voting, we have a meta-classifier that takes the predictions of the models produced by the base learners (h1...hn) as inputs. The problem with the naive stacking algorithm outlined above is that it has a high tendency to su↵er from extensive overfitting. The reason for a potentially high degree of overfitting is that if the base learners overfit, then the meta-classifier heavily relies on these predictions made by the base-classifiers. A better alternative would be to use stacking with k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation. Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18.

This chapter introduces the basic concepts of classification, describes some of the key issues such as model overfitting, and presents methods for evaluating and comparing the performance of a classification technique. While it focuses mainly on a technique known as decision tree induction, most of the discussion in this chapter is also applicable to other classification techniques, many of which are covered in Chapter 5. 4.1 Preliminaries The input data for a classification task is a collection of records. Each record, also known as an instance or example, is characterized by a tuple (x, y), where x is the attribute set and y is a special attribute, designated as the class label (also known as category or target attribute). Table 4.1 shows a sample data set used for classifying vertebrates into one of the following categories: mammal, bird, fish, reptile, or amphibian. The attribute set includes properties of a vertebrate such as its body temperature, skin cover, method of reproduction, ability to fly, and ability to live in water. Although the attributes presented in Table 4.1 are mostly discrete, the attribute set can also contain continuous features. The class label, on the other hand, must be a discrete attribute. This is a key characteristic that distinguishes classification from regression, a predictive modeling task in which y is a continuous attribute. Regression techniques are covered in Appendix D. Definition 4.1 (Classification). Classification is the task of learning a target function f that maps each attribute set x to one of the predefined class labels y. The target function is also known informally as a classification model. A classification model is useful for the following purposes. Descriptive Modeling A classification model can serve as an explanatory tool to distinguish between objects of different classes. For example, it would be useful—for both biologists and others—to have a descriptive model that 4.1 Preliminaries 147 Table 4.1. The vertebrate data set.

Predictive Modeling A classification model can also be used to predict the class label of unknown records. As shown in Figure 4.2, a classification model can be treated as a black box that automatically assigns a class label when presented with the attribute set of an unknown record. Suppose we are given the following characteristics of a creature known as a gila monster: Name Body Skin Gives Aquatic Aerial Has Hiber- Class Temperature Cover Birth Creature Creature Legs nates Label gila monster cold-blooded scales no no no yes yes ? We can use a classification model built from the data set shown in Table 4.1 to determine the class to which the creature belongs. Classification techniques are most suited for predicting or describing data sets with binary or nominal categories. They are less effective for ordinal categories (e.g., to classify a person as a member of high-, medium-, or lowincome group) because they do not consider the implicit order among the categories. Other forms of relationships, such as the subclass–superclass relationships among categories (e.g., humans and apes are primates, which in 148 Chapter 4 Classification turn, is a subclass of mammals) are also ignored. The remainder of this chapter focuses only on binary or nominal class labels. 4.2 General Approach to Solving a Classification Problem A classification technique (or classifier) is a systematic approach to building classification models from an input data set. Examples include decision tree classifiers, rule-based classifiers, neural networks, support vector machines, and na¨ıve Bayes classifiers. Each technique employs a learning algorithm to identify a model that best fits the relationship between the attribute set and class label of the input data. The model generated by a learning algorithm should both fit the input data well and correctly predict the class labels of records it has never seen before. Therefore, a key objective of the learning algorithm is to build models with good generalization capability; i.e., models that accurately predict the class labels of previously unknown records. Figure 4.3 shows a general approach for solving classification problems.

Predicted Class Class = 1 Class = 0 Actual Class = 1 f11 f10 Class Class = 0 f01 f00 be provided. The training set is used to build a classification model, which is subsequently applied to the test set, which consists of records with unknown class labels. Evaluation of the performance of a classification model is based on the counts of test records correctly and incorrectly predicted by the model. These counts are tabulated in a table known as a confusion matrix. Table 4.2 depicts the confusion matrix for a binary classification problem. Each entry fij in this table denotes the number of records from class i predicted to be of class j. For instance, f01 is the number of records from class 0 incorrectly predicted as class 1. Based on the entries in the confusion matrix, the total number of correct predictions made by the model is (f11 + f00) and the total number of incorrect predictions is (f10 + f01). Although a confusion matrix provides the information needed to determine how well a classification model performs, summarizing this information with a single number would make it more convenient to compare the performance of different models. This can be done using a performance metric such as accuracy, which is defined as follows: Accuracy = Number of correct predictions Total number of predictions = f11 + f00 f11 + f10 + f01 + f00 . (4.1) Equivalently, the performance of a model can be expressed in terms of its error rate, which is given by the following equation: Error rate = Number of wrong predictions Total number of predictions = f10 + f01 f11 + f10 + f01 + f00 . (4.2) Most classification algorithms seek models that attain the highest accuracy, or equivalently, the lowest error rate when applied to the test set. We will revisit the topic of model evaluation in Section 4.5. 150 Chapter 4 Classification 4.3 Decision Tree Induction This section introduces a decision tree classifier, which is a simple yet widely used classification technique. 4.3.1 How a Decision Tree Works To illustrate how classification with a decision tree works, consider a simpler version of the vertebrate classification problem described in the previous section. Instead of classifying the vertebrates into five distinct groups of species, we assign them to two categories: mammals and non-mammals. Suppose a new species is discovered by scientists. How can we tell whether it is a mammal or a non-mammal? One approach is to pose a series of questions about the characteristics of the species. The first question we may ask is whether the species is cold- or warm-blooded. If it is cold-blooded, then it is definitely not a mammal. Otherwise, it is either a bird or a mammal. In the latter case, we need to ask a follow-up question: Do the females of the species give birth to their young? Those that do give birth are definitely mammals, while those that do not are likely to be non-mammals (with the exception of egg-laying mammals such as the platypus and spiny anteater). The previous example illustrates how we can solve a classification problem by asking a series of carefully crafted questions about the attributes of the test record. Each time we receive an answer, a follow-up question is asked until we reach a conclusion about the class label of the record. The series of questions and their possible answers can be organized in the form of a decision tree, which is a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes and directed edges. Figure 4.4 shows the decision tree for the mammal classification problem. The tree has three types of nodes: • A root node that has no incoming edges and zero or more outgoing edges. • Internal nodes, each of which has exactly one incoming edge and two or more outgoing edges. • Leaf or terminal nodes, each of which has exactly one incoming edge and no outgoing edges. In a decision tree, each leaf node is assigned a class label. The nonterminal nodes, which include the root and other internal nodes, contain attribute test conditions to separate records that have different characteristics. For example, the root node shown in Figure 4.4 uses the attribute Body 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 151 Body Temperature Root node Leaf nodes Internal Warm Cold node Gives Birth Yes No Nonmammals Nonmammals Mammals Figure 4.4. A decision tree for the mammal classification problem. Temperature to separate warm-blooded from cold-blooded vertebrates. Since all cold-blooded vertebrates are non-mammals, a leaf node labeled Non-mammals is created as the right child of the root node. If the vertebrate is warm-blooded, a subsequent attribute, Gives Birth, is used to distinguish mammals from other warm-blooded creatures, which are mostly birds. Classifying a test record is straightforward once a decision tree has been constructed. Starting from the root node, we apply the test condition to the record and follow the appropriate branch based on the outcome of the test. This will lead us either to another internal node, for which a new test condition is applied, or to a leaf node. The class label associated with the leaf node is then assigned to the record. As an illustration, Figure 4.5 traces the path in the decision tree that is used to predict the class label of a flamingo. The path terminates at a leaf node labeled Non-mammals. 4.3.2 How to Build a Decision Tree In principle, there are exponentially many decision trees that can be constructed from a given set of attributes. While some of the trees are more accurate than others, finding the optimal tree is computationally infeasible because of the exponential size of the search space. Nevertheless, efficient algorithms have been developed to induce a reasonably accurate, albeit suboptimal, decision tree in a reasonable amount of time. These algorithms usually employ a greedy strategy that grows a decision tree by making a series of locally op- 152 Chapter 4 Classification Body Temperature Non- mammals Warm Cold Flamingo Warm No ... ?

The dashed lines represent the outcomes of applying various attribute test conditions on the unlabeled vertebrate. The vertebrate is eventually assigned to the Non-mammal class. timum decisions about which attribute to use for partitioning the data. One such algorithm is Hunt’s algorithm, which is the basis of many existing decision tree induction algorithms, including ID3, C4.5, and CART. This section presents a high-level discussion of Hunt’s algorithm and illustrates some of its design issues. Hunt’s Algorithm In Hunt’s algorithm, a decision tree is grown in a recursive fashion by partitioning the training records into successively purer subsets. Let Dt be the set of training records that are associated with node t and y = {y1, y2,...,yc} be the class labels. The following is a recursive definition of Hunt’s algorithm. Step 1: If all the records in Dt belong to the same class yt, then t is a leaf node labeled as yt. Step 2: If Dt contains records that belong to more than one class, an attribute test condition is selected to partition the records into smaller subsets. A child node is created for each outcome of the test condition and the records in Dt are distributed to the children based on the outcomes. The algorithm is then recursively applied to each child node. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 153 binary categorical continuous class Tid Defaulted Borrower Home Owner Marital Status Annual Income 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Yes No No Yes No No Yes No No No No No No No Yes No No Yes No Yes 125K 100K 70K 120K 95K 60K 220K 85K 75K 90K Single Married Single Married Divorced Married Divorced Single Married Single Figure 4.6. Training set for predicting borrowers who will default on loan payments. To illustrate how the algorithm works, consider the problem of predicting whether a loan applicant will repay her loan obligations or become delinquent, subsequently defaulting on her loan. A training set for this problem can be constructed by examining the records of previous borrowers. In the example shown in Figure 4.6, each record contains the personal information of a borrower along with a class label indicating whether the borrower has defaulted on loan payments. The initial tree for the classification problem contains a single node with class label Defaulted = No (see Figure 4.7(a)), which means that most of the borrowers successfully repaid their loans. The tree, however, needs to be refined since the root node contains records from both classes. The records are subsequently divided into smaller subsets based on the outcomes of the Home Owner test condition, as shown in Figure 4.7(b). The justification for choosing this attribute test condition will be discussed later. For now, we will assume that this is the best criterion for splitting the data at this point. Hunt’s algorithm is then applied recursively to each child of the root node. From the training set given in Figure 4.6, notice that all borrowers who are home owners successfully repaid their loans. The left child of the root is therefore a leaf node labeled Defaulted = No (see Figure 4.7(b)). For the right child, we need to continue applying the recursive step of Hunt’s algorithm until all the records belong to the same class. The trees resulting from each recursive step are shown in Figures 4.7(c) and (d). 154 Chapter 4 Classification Defaulted = No Yes No Home Owner Married Single, Divorced Defaulted = No Marital Status (a) (b) Defaulted = No Defaulted = No Yes No Defaulted = No Home Owner (c) (d) Defaulted = No < 80K >= 80K Defaulted = Yes Annual Income Defaulted = No Yes No Home Owner Single, Married Divorced Defaulted = Yes Defaulted = No Marital Status Figure 4.7. Hunt’s algorithm for inducing decision trees. Hunt’s algorithm will work if every combination of attribute values is present in the training data and each combination has a unique class label. These assumptions are too stringent for use in most practical situations. Additional conditions are needed to handle the following cases: 1. It is possible for some of the child nodes created in Step 2 to be empty; i.e., there are no records associated with these nodes. This can happen if none of the training records have the combination of attribute values associated with such nodes. In this case the node is declared a leaf node with the same class label as the majority class of training records associated with its parent node. 2. In Step 2, if all the records associated with Dt have identical attribute values (except for the class label), then it is not possible to split these records any further. In this case, the node is declared a leaf node with the same class label as the majority class of training records associated with this node. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 155 Design Issues of Decision Tree Induction A learning algorithm for inducing decision trees must address the following two issues. 1. How should the training records be split? Each recursive step of the tree-growing process must select an attribute test condition to divide the records into smaller subsets. To implement this step, the algorithm must provide a method for specifying the test condition for different attribute types as well as an objective measure for evaluating the goodness of each test condition. 2. How should the splitting procedure stop? A stopping condition is needed to terminate the tree-growing process. A possible strategy is to continue expanding a node until either all the records belong to the same class or all the records have identical attribute values. Although both conditions are sufficient to stop any decision tree induction algorithm, other criteria can be imposed to allow the tree-growing procedure to terminate earlier. The advantages of early termination will be discussed later in Section 4.4.5. 4.3.3 Methods for Expressing Attribute Test Conditions Decision tree induction algorithms must provide a method for expressing an attribute test condition and its corresponding outcomes for different attribute types. Binary Attributes The test condition for a binary attribute generates two potential outcomes, as shown in Figure 4.8. Body Temperature Warmblooded Coldblooded Figure 4.8. Test condition for binary attributes. 156 Chapter 4 Classification {Married} {Single, Divorced} (a) Multiway split Single Divorced Married {Single} {Married, Divorced} (b) Binary split {by grouping attribute values} {Single, Married} {Divorced} OR OR Marital Status Marital Status Marital Status Marital Status Figure 4.9. Test conditions for nominal attributes. Nominal Attributes Since a nominal attribute can have many values, its test condition can be expressed in two ways, as shown in Figure 4.9. For a multiway split (Figure 4.9(a)), the number of outcomes depends on the number of distinct values for the corresponding attribute. For example, if an attribute such as marital status has three distinct values—single, married, or divorced—its test condition will produce a three-way split. On the other hand, some decision tree algorithms, such as CART, produce only binary splits by considering all 2k−1 − 1 ways of creating a binary partition of k attribute values. Figure 4.9(b) illustrates three different ways of grouping the attribute values for marital status into two subsets. Ordinal Attributes Ordinal attributes can also produce binary or multiway splits. Ordinal attribute values can be grouped as long as the grouping does not violate the order property of the attribute values. Figure 4.10 illustrates various ways of splitting training records based on the Shirt Size attribute. The groupings shown in Figures 4.10(a) and (b) preserve the order among the attribute values, whereas the grouping shown in Figure 4.10(c) violates this property because it combines the attribute values Small and Large into 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 157 Shirt Size {Small, Medium} {Large, Extra Large} (a) Shirt Size {Small} {Medium, Large, Extra Large} (b) Shirt Size {Small, Large} {Medium, Extra Large} (c) Figure 4.10. Different ways of grouping ordinal attribute values. the same partition while Medium and Extra Large are combined into another partition. Continuous Attributes For continuous attributes, the test condition can be expressed as a comparison test (A<v) or (A ≥ v) with binary outcomes, or a range query with outcomes of the form vi ≤ A<vi+1, for i = 1,...,k. The difference between these approaches is shown in Figure 4.11. For the binary case, the decision tree algorithm must consider all possible split positions v, and it selects the one that produces the best partition. For the multiway split, the algorithm must consider all possible ranges of continuous values. One approach is to apply the discretization strategies described in Section 2.3.6 on page 57. After discretization, a new ordinal value will be assigned to each discretized interval. Adjacent intervals can also be aggregated into wider ranges as long as the order property is preserved.

Multiway versus binary splits. 4.3.4 Measures for Selecting the Best Split There are many measures that can be used to determine the best way to split the records. These measures are defined in terms of the class distribution of the records before and after splitting. Let p(i|t) denote the fraction of records belonging to class i at a given node t. We sometimes omit the reference to node t and express the fraction as pi. In a two-class problem, the class distribution at any node can be written as (p0, p1), where p1 = 1 − p0. To illustrate, consider the test conditions shown in Figure 4.12. The class distribution before splitting is (0.5, 0.5) because there are an equal number of records from each class. If we split the data using the Gender attribute, then the class distributions of the child nodes are (0.6, 0.4) and (0.4, 0.6), respectively. Although the classes are no longer evenly distributed, the child nodes still contain records from both classes. Splitting on the second attribute, Car Type, will result in purer partitions. The measures developed for selecting the best split are often based on the degree of impurity of the child nodes. The smaller the degree of impurity, the more skewed the class distribution. For example, a node with class distribution (0, 1) has zero impurity, whereas a node with uniform class distribution (0.5, 0.5) has the highest impurity. Examples of impurity measures include Entropy(t) = − c−1 i=0 p(i|t) log2 p(i|t), (4.3) Gini(t)=1 −c−1 i=0 [p(i|t)]2, (4.4) Classification error(t)=1 − max i [p(i|t)], (4.5) where c is the number of classes and 0 log2 0 = 0 in entropy calculations. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 159 Entropy Gini Misclassification error 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 p Figure 4.13. Comparison among the impurity measures for binary classification problems. Figure 4.13 compares the values of the impurity measures for binary classification problems. p refers to the fraction of records that belong to one of the two classes. Observe that all three measures attain their maximum value when the class distribution is uniform (i.e., when p = 0.5). The minimum values for the measures are attained when all the records belong to the same class (i.e., when p equals 0 or 1). We next provide several examples of computing the different impurity measures. Node N1 Count Class=0 0 Class=1 6 Gini = 1 − (0/6)2 − (6/6)2 = 0 Entropy = −(0/6) log2(0/6) − (6/6) log2(6/6) = 0 Error = 1 − max[0/6, 6/6] = 0 Node N2 Count Class=0 1 Class=1 5 Gini = 1 − (1/6)2 − (5/6)2 = 0.278 Entropy = −(1/6) log2(1/6) − (5/6) log2(5/6) = 0.650 Error = 1 − max[1/6, 5/6] = 0.167 Node N3 Count Class=0 3 Class=1 3 Gini = 1 − (3/6)2 − (3/6)2 = 0.5 Entropy = −(3/6) log2(3/6) − (3/6) log2(3/6) = 1 Error = 1 − max[3/6, 3/6] = 0.5 160 Chapter 4 Classification The preceding examples, along with Figure 4.13, illustrate the consistency among different impurity measures. Based on these calculations, node N1 has the lowest impurity value, followed by N2 and N3. Despite their consistency, the attribute chosen as the test condition may vary depending on the choice of impurity measure, as will be shown in Exercise 3 on page 198. To determine how well a test condition performs, we need to compare the degree of impurity of the parent node (before splitting) with the degree of impurity of the child nodes (after splitting). The larger their difference, the better the test condition. The gain, ∆, is a criterion that can be used to determine the goodness of a split: ∆ = I(parent) − k j=1 N(vj ) N I(vj ), (4.6) where I(·) is the impurity measure of a given node, N is the total number of records at the parent node, k is the number of attribute values, and N(vj ) is the number of records associated with the child node, vj . Decision tree induction algorithms often choose a test condition that maximizes the gain ∆. Since I(parent) is the same for all test conditions, maximizing the gain is equivalent to minimizing the weighted average impurity measures of the child nodes. Finally, when entropy is used as the impurity measure in Equation 4.6, the difference in entropy is known as the information gain, ∆info. Splitting of Binary Attributes Consider the diagram shown in Figure 4.14. Suppose there are two ways to split the data into smaller subsets. Before splitting, the Gini index is 0.5 since there are an equal number of records from both classes. If attribute A is chosen to split the data, the Gini index for node N1 is 0.4898, and for node N2, it is 0.480. The weighted average of the Gini index for the descendent nodes is (7/12) × 0.4898 + (5/12) × 0.480 = 0.486. Similarly, we can show that the weighted average of the Gini index for attribute B is 0.375. Since the subsets for attribute B have a smaller Gini index, it is preferred over attribute A. Splitting of Nominal Attributes As previously noted, a nominal attribute can produce either binary or multiway splits, as shown in Figure 4.15. The computation of the Gini index for a binary split is similar to that shown for determining binary attributes. For the first binary grouping of the Car Type attribute, the Gini index of {Sports, 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 161 Gini = 0.375 N1 1 4 5 2 N2 C0 C1 Gini = 0.500 Parent 6 6 C0 C1 Gini = 0.486 N1 4 3 2 3 N2 C0 Node N1 C1 Node N2 A Yes No Node N1 Node N2 B Yes No Figure 4.14.

Similarly, for the second binary grouping of {Sports} and {Family, Luxury}, the weighted average Gini index is 0.167. The second grouping has a lower Gini index because its corresponding subsets are much purer. 162 Chapter 4 Classification Sorted Values Split Positions No No No No No No No Yes Yes Yes Annual Income 60 70 90 100 120 220 75 95 85 125 Class Yes No Gini 55 65 72 80 87 92 97 110 122 172 230 <= <= > > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > 0 3 0 7 0 3 1 6 0 3 2 5 0 3 3 4 1 2 3 4 2 1 3 4 3 0 3 4 3 0 4 3 3 0 5 2 3 0 6 1 3 0 7 0 0.420 0.400 0.375 0.343 0.417 0.400 0.400 0.420 0.300 0.343 0.375 Figure 4.16. Splitting continuous attributes. For the multiway split, the Gini index is computed for every attribute value. Since Gini({Family}) = 0.375, Gini({Sports}) = 0, and Gini({Luxury}) = 0.219, the overall Gini index for the multiway split is equal to 4/20 × 0.375 + 8/20 × 0+8/20 × 0.219 = 0.163. The multiway split has a smaller Gini index compared to both two-way splits. This result is not surprising because the two-way split actually merges some of the outcomes of a multiway split, and thus, results in less pure subsets. Splitting of Continuous Attributes Consider the example shown in Figure 4.16, in which the test condition Annual Income ≤ v is used to split the training records for the loan default classification problem. A brute-force method for finding v is to consider every value of the attribute in the N records as a candidate split position. For each candidate v, the data set is scanned once to count the number of records with annual income less than or greater than v. We then compute the Gini index for each candidate and choose the one that gives the lowest value. This approach is computationally expensive because it requires O(N) operations to compute the Gini index at each candidate split position. Since there are N candidates, the overall complexity of this task is O(N2). To reduce the complexity, the training records are sorted based on their annual income, a computation that requires O(N log N) time. Candidate split positions are identified by taking the midpoints between two adjacent sorted values: 55, 65, 72, and so on. However, unlike the brute-force approach, we do not have to examine all N records when evaluating the Gini index of a candidate split position. For the first candidate, v = 55, none of the records has annual income less than 55K. As a result, the Gini index for the descendent node with Annual 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 163 Income < 55K is zero. On the other hand, the number of records with annual income greater than or equal to 55K is 3 (for class Yes) and 7 (for class No), respectively. Thus, the Gini index for this node is 0.420. The overall Gini index for this candidate split position is equal to 0 × 0+1 × 0.420 = 0.420. For the second candidate, v = 65, we can determine its class distribution by updating the distribution of the previous candidate. More specifically, the new distribution is obtained by examining the class label of the record with the lowest annual income (i.e., 60K). Since the class label for this record is No, the count for class No is increased from 0 to 1 (for Annual Income ≤ 65K) and is decreased from 7 to 6 (for Annual Income > 65K). The distribution for class Yes remains unchanged. The new weighted-average Gini index for this candidate split position is 0.400. This procedure is repeated until the Gini index values for all candidates are computed, as shown in Figure 4.16. The best split position corresponds to the one that produces the smallest Gini index, i.e., v = 97. This procedure is less expensive because it requires a constant amount of time to update the class distribution at each candidate split position. It can be further optimized by considering only candidate split positions located between two adjacent records with different class labels. For example, because the first three sorted records (with annual incomes 60K, 70K, and 75K) have identical class labels, the best split position should not reside between 60K and 75K. Therefore, the candidate split positions at v = 55K, 65K, 72K, 87K, 92K, 110K, 122K, 172K, and 230K are ignored because they are located between two adjacent records with the same class labels. This approach allows us to reduce the number of candidate split positions from 11 to 2. Gain Ratio Impurity measures such as entropy and Gini index tend to favor attributes that have a large number of distinct values. Figure 4.12 shows three alternative test conditions for partitioning the data set given in Exercise 2 on page 198. Comparing the first test condition, Gender, with the second, Car Type, it is easy to see that Car Type seems to provide a better way of splitting the data since it produces purer descendent nodes. However, if we compare both conditions with Customer ID, the latter appears to produce purer partitions. Yet Customer ID is not a predictive attribute because its value is unique for each record. Even in a less extreme situation, a test condition that results in a large number of outcomes may not be desirable because the number of records associated with each partition is too small to enable us to make any reliable predictions. 164 Chapter 4 Classification There are two strategies for overcoming this problem. The first strategy is to restrict the test conditions to binary splits only. This strategy is employed by decision tree algorithms such as CART. Another strategy is to modify the splitting criterion to take into account the number of outcomes produced by the attribute test condition. For example, in the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, a splitting criterion known as gain ratio is used to determine the goodness of a split. This criterion is defined as follows: Gain ratio = ∆info Split Info. (4.7) Here, Split Info = −k i=1 P(vi) log2 P(vi) and k is the total number of splits. For example, if each attribute value has the same number of records, then ∀i : P(vi)=1/k and the split information would be equal to log2 k. This example suggests that if an attribute produces a large number of splits, its split information will also be large, which in turn reduces its gain ratio. 4.3.5 Algorithm for Decision Tree Induction A skeleton decision tree induction algorithm called TreeGrowth is shown in Algorithm 4.1. The input to this algorithm consists of the training records E and the attribute set F. The algorithm works by recursively selecting the best attribute to split the data (Step 7) and expanding the leaf nodes of the Algorithm 4.1 A skeleton decision tree induction algorithm. TreeGrowth (E, F) 1: if stopping cond(E,F) = true then 2: leaf = createNode(). 3: leaf.label = Classify(E). 4: return leaf. 5: else 6: root = createNode(). 7: root.test cond = find best split(E, F). 8: let V = {v|v is a possible outcome of root.test cond }. 9: for each v ∈ V do 10: Ev = {e | root.test cond(e) = v and e ∈ E}. 11: child = TreeGrowth(Ev, F). 12: add child as descendent of root and label the edge (root → child) as v. 13: end for 14: end if 15: return root. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 165 tree (Steps 11 and 12) until the stopping criterion is met (Step 1). The details of this algorithm are explained below: 1. The createNode() function extends the decision tree by creating a new node. A node in the decision tree has either a test condition, denoted as node.test cond, or a class label, denoted as node.label. 2. The find best split() function determines which attribute should be selected as the test condition for splitting the training records. As previously noted, the choice of test condition depends on which impurity measure is used to determine the goodness of a split. Some widely used measures include entropy, the Gini index, and the χ2 statistic. 3. The Classify() function determines the class label to be assigned to a leaf node. For each leaf node t, let p(i|t) denote the fraction of training records from class i associated with the node t. In most cases, the leaf node is assigned to the class that has the majority number of training records: leaf.label = argmax i p(i|t), (4.8) where the argmax operator returns the argument i that maximizes the expression p(i|t). Besides providing the information needed to determine the class label of a leaf node, the fraction p(i|t) can also be used to estimate the probability that a record assigned to the leaf node t belongs to class i. Sections 5.7.2 and 5.7.3 describe how such probability estimates can be used to determine the performance of a decision tree under different cost functions. 4. The stopping cond() function is used to terminate the tree-growing process by testing whether all the records have either the same class label or the same attribute values. Another way to terminate the recursive function is to test whether the number of records have fallen below some minimum threshold. After building the decision tree, a tree-pruning step can be performed to reduce the size of the decision tree. Decision trees that are too large are susceptible to a phenomenon known as overfitting. Pruning helps by trimming the branches of the initial tree in a way that improves the generalization capability of the decision tree. The issues of overfitting and tree pruning are discussed in more detail in Section 4.4. 166 Chapter 4 Classification Session IP Address Timestamp Protocol Status Referrer User Agent Number of Bytes Requested Web Page Request Method 08/Aug/2004 10:15:21 1 GET 160.11.11.11 http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar HTTP/1.1 200 6424 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) 08/Aug/2004 10:15:34 1 GET http://www.cs.umn.edu/ 160.11.11.11 ~kumar/MINDS http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar HTTP/1.1 200 41378 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) 08/Aug/2004 10:15:41 1 GET 160.11.11.11 08/Aug/2004 10:16:11 1 GET 160.11.11.11 08/Aug/2004 10:16:15 2 GET 35.9.2.2 http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar/MINDS/MINDS _papers.htm http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar/papers/papers. html http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~steinbac http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar/MINDS HTTP/1.1 200 HTTP/1.1 200 HTTP/1.0 Attribute Name Description 200 1018516 7463 3149 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040616 (a) Example of a Web server log. http://www.cs.umn.edu/~kumar MINDS papers/papers.html MINDS/MINDS_papers.htm (b) Graph of a Web session.

Input data for Web robot detection. 4.3.6 An Example: Web Robot Detection Web usage mining is the task of applying data mining techniques to extract useful patterns from Web access logs. These patterns can reveal interesting characteristics of site visitors; e.g., people who repeatedly visit a Web site and view the same product description page are more likely to buy the product if certain incentives such as rebates or free shipping are offered. In Web usage mining, it is important to distinguish accesses made by human users from those due to Web robots. A Web robot (also known as a Web crawler) is a software program that automatically locates and retrieves information from the Internet by following the hyperlinks embedded in Web pages. These programs are deployed by search engine portals to gather the documents necessary for indexing the Web. Web robot accesses must be discarded before applying Web mining techniques to analyze human browsing behavior. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 167 This section describes how a decision tree classifier can be used to distinguish between accesses by human users and those by Web robots. The input data was obtained from a Web server log, a sample of which is shown in Figure 4.17(a). Each line corresponds to a single page request made by a Web client (a user or a Web robot). The fields recorded in the Web log include the IP address of the client, timestamp of the request, Web address of the requested document, size of the document, and the client’s identity (via the user agent field). A Web session is a sequence of requests made by a client during a single visit to a Web site. Each Web session can be modeled as a directed graph, in which the nodes correspond to Web pages and the edges correspond to hyperlinks connecting one Web page to another. Figure 4.17(b) shows a graphical representation of the first Web session given in the Web server log. To classify the Web sessions, features are constructed to describe the characteristics of each session. Figure 4.17(c) shows some of the features used for the Web robot detection task. Among the notable features include the depth and breadth of the traversal. Depth determines the maximum distance of a requested page, where distance is measured in terms of the number of hyperlinks away from the entry point of the Web site. For example, the home page http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼kumar is assumed to be at depth 0, whereas http://www.cs.umn.edu/kumar/MINDS/MINDS papers.htm is located at depth 2. Based on the Web graph shown in Figure 4.17(b), the depth attribute for the first session is equal to two. The breadth attribute measures the width of the corresponding Web graph. For example, the breadth of the Web session shown in Figure 4.17(b) is equal to two. The data set for classification contains 2916 records, with equal numbers of sessions due to Web robots (class 1) and human users (class 0). 10% of the data were reserved for training while the remaining 90% were used for testing. The induced decision tree model is shown in Figure 4.18. The tree has an error rate equal to 3.8% on the training set and 5.3% on the test set. The model suggests that Web robots can be distinguished from human users in the following way: 1. Accesses by Web robots tend to be broad but shallow, whereas accesses by human users tend to be more focused (narrow but deep). 2. Unlike human users, Web robots seldom retrieve the image pages associated with a Web document. 3. Sessions due to Web robots tend to be long and contain a large number of requested pages. 168 Chapter 4 Classification Decision Tree: depth = 1: | breadth> 7 : class 1 | breadth<= 7: | | breadth <= 3: | | | ImagePages> 0.375: class 0 | | | ImagePages<= 0.375: | | | | totalPages<= 6: class 1 | | | | totalPages> 6: | | | | | breadth <= 1: class 1 | | | | | breadth > 1: class 0 | | width > 3: | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | ImagePages<= 0.1333: class 1 | | | | ImagePages> 0.1333: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: class 1 | | | MultilP = 1: | | | | TotalTime <= 361: class 0 | | | | TotalTime > 361: class 1 depth> 1: | MultiAgent = 0: | | depth > 2: class 0 | | depth < 2: | | | MultilP = 1: class 0 | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: | | | | | RepeatedAccess <= 0.322: class 0 | | | | | RepeatedAccess > 0.322: class 1 | MultiAgent = 1: | | totalPages <= 81: class 0 | | totalPages > 81: class 1 Figure 4.18.

Web robots are more likely to make repeated requests for the same document since the Web pages retrieved by human users are often cached by the browser. 4.3.7 Characteristics of Decision Tree Induction The following is a summary of the important characteristics of decision tree induction algorithms. 1. Decision tree induction is a nonparametric approach for building classification models. In other words, it does not require any prior assumptions regarding the type of probability distributions satisfied by the class and other attributes (unlike some of the techniques described in Chapter 5). 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 169 2. Finding an optimal decision tree is an NP-complete problem. Many decision tree algorithms employ a heuristic-based approach to guide their search in the vast hypothesis space. For example, the algorithm presented in Section 4.3.5 uses a greedy, top-down, recursive partitioning strategy for growing a decision tree. 3. Techniques developed for constructing decision trees are computationally inexpensive, making it possible to quickly construct models even when the training set size is very large. Furthermore, once a decision tree has been built, classifying a test record is extremely fast, with a worst-case complexity of O(w), where w is the maximum depth of the tree. 4. Decision trees, especially smaller-sized trees, are relatively easy to interpret. The accuracies of the trees are also comparable to other classification techniques for many simple data sets. 5. Decision trees provide an expressive representation for learning discretevalued functions. However, they do not generalize well to certain types of Boolean problems. One notable example is the parity function, whose value is 0 (1) when there is an odd (even) number of Boolean attributes with the value T rue. Accurate modeling of such a function requires a full decision tree with 2d nodes, where d is the number of Boolean attributes (see Exercise 1 on page 198). 6. Decision tree algorithms are quite robust to the presence of noise, especially when methods for avoiding overfitting, as described in Section 4.4, are employed. 7. The presence of redundant attributes does not adversely affect the accuracy of decision trees. An attribute is redundant if it is strongly correlated with another attribute in the data. One of the two redundant attributes will not be used for splitting once the other attribute has been chosen. However, if the data set contains many irrelevant attributes, i.e., attributes that are not useful for the classification task, then some of the irrelevant attributes may be accidently chosen during the tree-growing process, which results in a decision tree that is larger than necessary. Feature selection techniques can help to improve the accuracy of decision trees by eliminating the irrelevant attributes during preprocessing. We will investigate the issue of too many irrelevant attributes in Section 4.4.3. 170 Chapter 4 Classification 8. Since most decision tree algorithms employ a top-down, recursive partitioning approach, the number of records becomes smaller as we traverse down the tree. At the leaf nodes, the number of records may be too small to make a statistically significant decision about the class representation of the nodes. This is known as the data fragmentation problem. One possible solution is to disallow further splitting when the number of records falls below a certain threshold. 9. A subtree can be replicated multiple times in a decision tree, as illustrated in Figure 4.19. This makes the decision tree more complex than necessary and perhaps more difficult to interpret. Such a situation can arise from decision tree implementations that rely on a single attribute test condition at each internal node. Since most of the decision tree algorithms use a divide-and-conquer partitioning strategy, the same test condition can be applied to different parts of the attribute space, thus leading to the subtree replication problem. 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 P R Q S Q S Figure 4.19. Tree replication problem. The same subtree can appear at different branches. 10. The test conditions described so far in this chapter involve using only a single attribute at a time. As a consequence, the tree-growing procedure can be viewed as the process of partitioning the attribute space into disjoint regions until each region contains records of the same class (see Figure 4.20). The border between two neighboring regions of different classes is known as a decision boundary. Since the test condition involves only a single attribute, the decision boundaries are rectilinear; i.e., parallel to the “coordinate axes.” This limits the expressiveness of the 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 171 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 x y Yes No Yes No Yes No y < 0.33 :4 :0 :0 :4 :0 :3 :4 :0 x < 0.43 y < 0.47 Figure 4.20.

Figure 4.21 illustrates a data set that cannot be classified effectively by a decision tree algorithm that uses test conditions involving only a single attribute at a time. 172 Chapter 4 Classification An oblique decision tree can be used to overcome this limitation because it allows test conditions that involve more than one attribute. The data set given in Figure 4.21 can be easily represented by an oblique decision tree containing a single node with test condition x + y < 1. Although such techniques are more expressive and can produce more compact trees, finding the optimal test condition for a given node can be computationally expensive. Constructive induction provides another way to partition the data into homogeneous, nonrectangular regions (see Section 2.3.5 on page 57). This approach creates composite attributes representing an arithmetic or logical combination of the existing attributes. The new attributes provide a better discrimination of the classes and are augmented to the data set prior to decision tree induction. Unlike the oblique decision tree approach, constructive induction is less expensive because it identifies all the relevant combinations of attributes once, prior to constructing the decision tree. In contrast, an oblique decision tree must determine the right attribute combination dynamically, every time an internal node is expanded. However, constructive induction can introduce attribute redundancy in the data since the new attribute is a combination of several existing attributes. 11. Studies have shown that the choice of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of decision tree induction algorithms. This is because many impurity measures are quite consistent with each other, as shown in Figure 4.13 on page 159. Indeed, the strategy used to prune the tree has a greater impact on the final tree than the choice of impurity measure. 4.4 Model Overfitting The errors committed by a classification model are generally divided into two types: training errors and generalization errors. Training error, also known as resubstitution error or apparent error, is the number of misclassification errors committed on training records, whereas generalization error is the expected error of the model on previously unseen records. Recall from Section 4.2 that a good classification model must not only fit the training data well, it must also accurately classify records it has never 4.4 Model Overfitting 173 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Training set x1 x2 Figure 4.22. Example of a data set with binary classes. seen before. In other words, a good model must have low training error as well as low generalization error. This is important because a model that fits the training data too well can have a poorer generalization error than a model with a higher training error. Such a situation is known as model overfitting. Overfitting Example in Two-Dimensional Data For a more concrete example of the overfitting problem, consider the two-dimensional data set shown in Figure 4.22. The data set contains data points that belong to two different classes, denoted as class o and class +, respectively. The data points for the o class are generated from a mixture of three Gaussian distributions, while a uniform distribution is used to generate the data points for the + class. There are altogether 1200 points belonging to the o class and 1800 points belonging to the + class. 30% of the points are chosen for training, while the remaining 70% are used for testing. A decision tree classifier that uses the Gini index as its impurity measure is then applied to the training set. To investigate the effect of overfitting, different levels of pruning are applied to the initial, fully-grown tree. Figure 4.23(b) shows the training and test error rates of the decision tree. 174 Chapter 4 Classification 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 Number of Nodes Error Rate Test Error Training Error Figure 4.23. Training and test error rates. Notice that the training and test error rates of the model are large when the size of the tree is very small. This situation is known as model underfitting. Underfitting occurs because the model has yet to learn the true structure of the data. As a result, it performs poorly on both the training and the test sets. As the number of nodes in the decision tree increases, the tree will have fewer training and test errors. However, once the tree becomes too large, its test error rate begins to increase even though its training error rate continues to decrease. This phenomenon is known as model overfitting. To understand the overfitting phenomenon, note that the training error of a model can be reduced by increasing the model complexity. For example, the leaf nodes of the tree can be expanded until it perfectly fits the training data. Although the training error for such a complex tree is zero, the test error can be large because the tree may contain nodes that accidently fit some of the noise points in the training data. Such nodes can degrade the performance of the tree because they do not generalize well to the test examples. Figure 4.24 shows the structure of two decision trees with different number of nodes. The tree that contains the smaller number of nodes has a higher training error rate, but a lower test error rate compared to the more complex tree. Overfitting and underfitting are two pathologies that are related to the model complexity. The remainder of this section examines some of the potential causes of model overfitting. 4.4 Model Overfitting 175 x1 < 13.29 x2 < 17.35 x2 < 12.63 x1 < 6.56 x2 < 1.38 x1 < 2.15 x1 < 7.24 x1 < 12.11 x1 < 18.88 x2 < 8.64 (a) Decision tree with 11 leaf nodes. x1 < 13.29 x2 < 17.35 x2 < 12.63 x1 < 6.56 x2 < 8.64 x2 < 1.38 x1 < 2.15 x1 < 7.24 x1 < 12.11 x1 < 18.88 x2 < 4.06 x1 < 6.99 x1 < 6.78 x2 < 19.93 x1 < 3.03 x2 < 12.68 x1 < 2.72 x2 < 15.77 x2 < 17.14 x2 < 12.89 x2 < 13.80 x2 < 16.75 x2 < 16.33 (b) Decision tree with 24 leaf nodes.

Decision trees with different model complexities. 4.4.1 Overfitting Due to Presence of Noise Consider the training and test sets shown in Tables 4.3 and 4.4 for the mammal classification problem. Two of the ten training records are mislabeled: bats and whales are classified as non-mammals instead of mammals. A decision tree that perfectly fits the training data is shown in Figure 4.25(a). Although the training error for the tree is zero, its error rate on Table 4.3. An example training set for classifying mammals. Class labels with asterisk symbols represent mislabeled records.

Decision tree induced from the data set shown in Table 4.3. the test set is 30%. Both humans and dolphins were misclassified as nonmammals because their attribute values for Body Temperature, Gives Birth, and Four-legged are identical to the mislabeled records in the training set. Spiny anteaters, on the other hand, represent an exceptional case in which the class label of a test record contradicts the class labels of other similar records in the training set. Errors due to exceptional cases are often unavoidable and establish the minimum error rate achievable by any classifier. 4.4 Model Overfitting 177 In contrast, the decision tree M2 shown in Figure 4.25(b) has a lower test error rate (10%) even though its training error rate is somewhat higher (20%). It is evident that the first decision tree, M1, has overfitted the training data because there is a simpler model with lower error rate on the test set. The Four-legged attribute test condition in model M1 is spurious because it fits the mislabeled training records, which leads to the misclassification of records in the test set. 4.4.2 Overfitting Due to Lack of Representative Samples Models that make their classification decisions based on a small number of training records are also susceptible to overfitting. Such models can be generated because of lack of representative samples in the training data and learning algorithms that continue to refine their models even when few training records are available. We illustrate these effects in the example below. Consider the five training records shown in Table 4.5. All of these training records are labeled correctly and the corresponding decision tree is depicted in Figure 4.26. Although its training error is zero, its error rate on the test set is 30%. Table 4.5. An example training set for classifying mammals.

The tree arrives at this classification decision because there is only one training record, which is an eagle, with such characteristics. This example clearly demonstrates the danger of making wrong predictions when there are not enough representative examples at the leaf nodes of a decision tree. 178 Chapter 4 Classification Warm-blooded Cold-blooded Hibernates Yes No Nonmammals Nonmammals Nonmammals Mammals Fourlegged Yes No Body Temperature Figure 4.26. Decision tree induced from the data set shown in Table 4.5. 4.4.3 Overfitting and the Multiple Comparison Procedure Model overfitting may arise in learning algorithms that employ a methodology known as multiple comparison procedure. To understand multiple comparison procedure, consider the task of predicting whether the stock market will rise or fall in the next ten trading days. If a stock analyst simply makes random guesses, the probability that her prediction is correct on any trading day is 0.5. However, the probability that she will predict correctly at least eight out of the ten times is 10 8 + 10 9 + 10 10 210 = 0.0547, which seems quite unlikely. Suppose we are interested in choosing an investment advisor from a pool of fifty stock analysts. Our strategy is to select the analyst who makes the most correct predictions in the next ten trading days. The flaw in this strategy is that even if all the analysts had made their predictions in a random fashion, the probability that at least one of them makes at least eight correct predictions is 1 − (1 − 0.0547)50 = 0.9399, which is very high. Although each analyst has a low probability of predicting at least eight times correctly, putting them together, we have a high probability of finding an analyst who can do so. Furthermore, there is no guarantee in the 4.4 Model Overfitting 179 future that such an analyst will continue to make accurate predictions through random guessing. How does the multiple comparison procedure relate to model overfitting? Many learning algorithms explore a set of independent alternatives, {γi}, and then choose an alternative, γmax, that maximizes a given criterion function. The algorithm will add γmax to the current model in order to improve its overall performance. This procedure is repeated until no further improvement is observed. As an example, during decision tree growing, multiple tests are performed to determine which attribute can best split the training data. The attribute that leads to the best split is chosen to extend the tree as long as the observed improvement is statistically significant. Let T0 be the initial decision tree and Tx be the new tree after inserting an internal node for attribute x. In principle, x can be added to the tree if the observed gain, ∆(T0, Tx), is greater than some predefined threshold α. If there is only one attribute test condition to be evaluated, then we can avoid inserting spurious nodes by choosing a large enough value of α. However, in practice, more than one test condition is available and the decision tree algorithm must choose the best attribute xmax from a set of candidates, {x1, x2,...,xk}, to partition the data. In this situation, the algorithm is actually using a multiple comparison procedure to decide whether a decision tree should be extended. More specifically, it is testing for ∆(T0, Txmax ) > α instead of ∆(T0, Tx) > α. As the number of alternatives, k, increases, so does our chance of finding ∆(T0, Txmax ) > α. Unless the gain function ∆ or threshold α is modified to account for k, the algorithm may inadvertently add spurious nodes to the model, which leads to model overfitting. This effect becomes more pronounced when the number of training records from which xmax is chosen is small, because the variance of ∆(T0, Txmax ) is high when fewer examples are available for training. As a result, the probability of finding ∆(T0, Txmax ) > α increases when there are very few training records. This often happens when the decision tree grows deeper, which in turn reduces the number of records covered by the nodes and increases the likelihood of adding unnecessary nodes into the tree. Failure to compensate for the large number of alternatives or the small number of training records will therefore lead to model overfitting. 4.4.4 Estimation of Generalization Errors Although the primary reason for overfitting is still a subject of debate, it is generally agreed that the complexity of a model has an impact on model overfitting, as was illustrated in Figure 4.23. The question is, how do we 180 Chapter 4 Classification determine the right model complexity? The ideal complexity is that of a model that produces the lowest generalization error. The problem is that the learning algorithm has access only to the training set during model building (see Figure 4.3). It has no knowledge of the test set, and thus, does not know how well the tree will perform on records it has never seen before. The best it can do is to estimate the generalization error of the induced tree. This section presents several methods for doing the estimation. Using Resubstitution Estimate The resubstitution estimate approach assumes that the training set is a good representation of the overall data. Consequently, the training error, otherwise known as resubstitution error, can be used to provide an optimistic estimate for the generalization error. Under this assumption, a decision tree induction algorithm simply selects the model that produces the lowest training error rate as its final model. However, the training error is usually a poor estimate of generalization error. Example 4.1. Consider the binary decision trees shown in Figure 4.27. Assume that both trees are generated from the same training data and both make their classification decisions at each leaf node according to the majority class. Note that the left tree, TL, is more complex because it expands some of the leaf nodes in the right tree, TR. The training error rate for the left tree is e(TL)=4/24 = 0.167, while the training error rate for the right tree is +: 3 –: 1 +: 2 –: 1 +: 0 –: 2 +: 1 –: 2 +: 3 –: 1 +: 0 –: 5 +: 5 –: 2 +: 1 –: 4 +: 3 –: 0 +: 3 –: 6 +: 3 –: 0 Decision Tree, TL Decision Tree, TR Figure 4.27. Example of two decision trees generated from the same training data. 4.4 Model Overfitting 181 e(TR)=6/24 = 0.25. Based on their resubstitution estimate, the left tree is considered better than the right tree. Incorporating Model Complexity As previously noted, the chance for model overfitting increases as the model becomes more complex. For this reason, we should prefer simpler models, a strategy that agrees with a well-known principle known as Occam’s razor or the principle of parsimony: Definition 4.2. Occam’s Razor: Given two models with the same generalization errors, the simpler model is preferred over the more complex model. Occam’s razor is intuitive because the additional components in a complex model stand a greater chance of being fitted purely by chance. In the words of Einstein, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” Next, we present two methods for incorporating model complexity into the evaluation of classification models. Pessimistic Error Estimate The first approach explicitly computes generalization error as the sum of training error and a penalty term for model complexity. The resulting generalization error can be considered its pessimistic error estimate. For instance, let n(t) be the number of training records classified by node t and e(t) be the number of misclassified records. The pessimistic error estimate of a decision tree T, eg(T), can be computed as follows: eg(T) = k i=1[e(ti) + Ω(ti)] k i=1 n(ti) = e(T) + Ω(T) Nt , where k is the number of leaf nodes, e(T) is the overall training error of the decision tree, Nt is the number of training records, and Ω(ti) is the penalty term associated with each node ti. Example 4.2. Consider the binary decision trees shown in Figure 4.27. If the penalty term is equal to 0.5, then the pessimistic error estimate for the left tree is eg(TL) = 4+7 × 0.5 24 = 7.5 24 = 0.3125 and the pessimistic error estimate for the right tree is eg(TR) = 6+4 × 0.5 24 = 8 24 = 0.3333. 182 Chapter 4 Classification A?

Thus, the left tree has a better pessimistic error rate than the right tree. For binary trees, a penalty term of 0.5 means a node should always be expanded into its two child nodes as long as it improves the classification of at least one training record because expanding a node, which is equivalent to adding 0.5 to the overall error, is less costly than committing one training error. If Ω(t) = 1 for all the nodes t, the pessimistic error estimate for the left tree is eg(TL) = 11/24 = 0.458, while the pessimistic error estimate for the right tree is eg(TR) = 10/24 = 0.417. The right tree therefore has a better pessimistic error rate than the left tree. Thus, a node should not be expanded into its child nodes unless it reduces the misclassification error for more than one training record. Minimum Description Length Principle Another way to incorporate model complexity is based on an information-theoretic approach known as the minimum description length or MDL principle. To illustrate this principle, consider the example shown in Figure 4.28. In this example, both A and B are given a set of records with known attribute values x. In addition, person A knows the exact class label for each record, while person B knows none of this information. B can obtain the classification of each record by requesting that A transmits the class labels sequentially. Such a message would require Θ(n) bits of information, where n is the total number of records. Alternatively, A may decide to build a classification model that summarizes the relationship between x and y. The model can be encoded in a compact 4.4 Model Overfitting 183 form before being transmitted to B. If the model is 100% accurate, then the cost of transmission is equivalent to the cost of encoding the model. Otherwise, A must also transmit information about which record is classified incorrectly by the model. Thus, the overall cost of transmission is Cost(model, data) = Cost(model) + Cost(data|model), (4.9) where the first term on the right-hand side is the cost of encoding the model, while the second term represents the cost of encoding the mislabeled records. According to the MDL principle, we should seek a model that minimizes the overall cost function. An example showing how to compute the total description length of a decision tree is given by Exercise 9 on page 202. Estimating Statistical Bounds The generalization error can also be estimated as a statistical correction to the training error. Since generalization error tends to be larger than training error, the statistical correction is usually computed as an upper bound to the training error, taking into account the number of training records that reach a particular leaf node. For instance, in the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, the number of errors committed by each leaf node is assumed to follow a binomial distribution. To compute its generalization error, we must determine the upper bound limit to the observed training error, as illustrated in the next example. Example 4.3. Consider the left-most branch of the binary decision trees shown in Figure 4.27. Observe that the left-most leaf node of TR has been expanded into two child nodes in TL. Before splitting, the error rate of the node is 2/7=0.286. By approximating a binomial distribution with a normal distribution, the following upper bound of the error rate e can be derived: eupper(N, e, α) = e + z2 α/2 2N + zα/2 e(1−e) N + z2 α/2 4N2 1 + z2 α/2 N , (4.10) where α is the confidence level, zα/2 is the standardized value from a standard normal distribution, and N is the total number of training records used to compute e. By replacing α = 25%, N = 7, and e = 2/7, the upper bound for the error rate is eupper(7, 2/7, 0.25) = 0.503, which corresponds to 7 × 0.503 = 3.521 errors. If we expand the node into its child nodes as shown in TL, the training error rates for the child nodes are 1/4=0.250 and 1/3=0.333, 184 Chapter 4 Classification respectively. Using Equation 4.10, the upper bounds of these error rates are eupper(4, 1/4, 0.25) = 0.537 and eupper(3, 1/3, 0.25) = 0.650, respectively. The overall training error of the child nodes is 4× 0.537 + 3 × 0.650 = 4.098, which is larger than the estimated error for the corresponding node in TR. Using a Validation Set In this approach, instead of using the training set to estimate the generalization error, the original training data is divided into two smaller subsets. One of the subsets is used for training, while the other, known as the validation set, is used for estimating the generalization error. Typically, two-thirds of the training set is reserved for model building, while the remaining one-third is used for error estimation. This approach is typically used with classification techniques that can be parameterized to obtain models with different levels of complexity. The complexity of the best model can be estimated by adjusting the parameter of the learning algorithm (e.g., the pruning level of a decision tree) until the empirical model produced by the learning algorithm attains the lowest error rate on the validation set. Although this approach provides a better way for estimating how well the model performs on previously unseen records, less data is available for training. 4.4.5 Handling Overfitting in Decision Tree Induction In the previous section, we described several methods for estimating the generalization error of a classification model. Having a reliable estimate of generalization error allows the learning algorithm to search for an accurate model without overfitting the training data. This section presents two strategies for avoiding model overfitting in the context of decision tree induction. Prepruning (Early Stopping Rule) In this approach, the tree-growing algorithm is halted before generating a fully grown tree that perfectly fits the entire training data. To do this, a more restrictive stopping condition must be used; e.g., stop expanding a leaf node when the observed gain in impurity measure (or improvement in the estimated generalization error) falls below a certain threshold. The advantage of this approach is that it avoids generating overly complex subtrees that overfit the training data. Nevertheless, it is difficult to choose the right threshold for early termination. Too high of a threshold will result in underfitted models, while a threshold that is set too low may not be sufficient to overcome the model overfitting problem. Furthermore, 4.4 Model Overfitting 185 Decision Tree: Simplified Decision Tree: Subtree Replacement Subtree Raising depth = 1: | breadth> 7 : class 1 | breadth<= 7: | | breadth <= 3: | | | ImagePages> 0.375: class 0 | | | ImagePages<= 0.375: | | | | totalPages<= 6: class 1 | | | | totalPages> 6: | | | | | breadth <= 1: class 1 | | | | | breadth > 1: class 0 | | width > 3: | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | ImagePages<= 0.1333: class 1 | | | | ImagePages> 0.1333: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: class 1 | | | MultilP = 1: | | | | TotalTime <= 361: class 0 | | | | TotalTime > 361: class 1 depth> 1: | MultiAgent = 0: | | depth > 2: class 0 | | depth <= 2: | | | MultilP = 1: class 0 | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: | | | | | RepeatedAccess <= 0.322: class 0 | | | | | RepeatedAccess > 0.322: class 1 | MultiAgent = 1: | | totalPages <= 81: class 0 | | totalPages > 81: class 1 depth = 1: | ImagePages <= 0.1333: class 1 | ImagePages > 0.1333: | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | breadth > 6: class 1 depth > 1: | MultiAgent = 0: class 0 | MultiAgent = 1: | | totalPages <= 81: class 0 | | totalPages > 81: class 1 Figure 4.29. Post-pruning of the decision tree for Web robot detection. even if no significant gain is obtained using one of the existing attribute test conditions, subsequent splitting may result in better subtrees. Post-pruning In this approach, the decision tree is initially grown to its maximum size. This is followed by a tree-pruning step, which proceeds to trim the fully grown tree in a bottom-up fashion. Trimming can be done by replacing a subtree with (1) a new leaf node whose class label is determined from the majority class of records affiliated with the subtree, or (2) the most frequently used branch of the subtree. The tree-pruning step terminates when no further improvement is observed. Post-pruning tends to give better results than prepruning because it makes pruning decisions based on a fully grown tree, unlike prepruning, which can suffer from premature termination of the tree-growing process. However, for post-pruning, the additional computations needed to grow the full tree may be wasted when the subtree is pruned. Figure 4.29 illustrates the simplified decision tree model for the Web robot detection example given in Section 4.3.6. Notice that the subtrees rooted at 186 Chapter 4 Classification depth = 1 have been replaced by one of the branches involving the attribute ImagePages. This approach is also known as subtree raising. The depth > 1 and MultiAgent = 0 subtree has been replaced by a leaf node assigned to class 0. This approach is known as subtree replacement. The subtree for depth > 1 and MultiAgent = 1 remains intact. 4.5 Evaluating the Performance of a Classifier Section 4.4.4 described several methods for estimating the generalization error of a model during training. The estimated error helps the learning algorithm to do model selection; i.e., to find a model of the right complexity that is not susceptible to overfitting. Once the model has been constructed, it can be applied to the test set to predict the class labels of previously unseen records. It is often useful to measure the performance of the model on the test set because such a measure provides an unbiased estimate of its generalization error. The accuracy or error rate computed from the test set can also be used to compare the relative performance of different classifiers on the same domain. However, in order to do this, the class labels of the test records must be known. This section reviews some of the methods commonly used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. 4.5.1 Holdout Method In the holdout method, the original data with labeled examples is partitioned into two disjoint sets, called the training and the test sets, respectively. A classification model is then induced from the training set and its performance is evaluated on the test set. The proportion of data reserved for training and for testing is typically at the discretion of the analysts (e.g., 50-50 or twothirds for training and one-third for testing). The accuracy of the classifier can be estimated based on the accuracy of the induced model on the test set. The holdout method has several well-known limitations. First, fewer labeled examples are available for training because some of the records are withheld for testing. As a result, the induced model may not be as good as when all the labeled examples are used for training. Second, the model may be highly dependent on the composition of the training and test sets. The smaller the training set size, the larger the variance of the model. On the other hand, if the training set is too large, then the estimated accuracy computed from the smaller test set is less reliable. Such an estimate is said to have a wide confidence interval. Finally, the training and test sets are no longer independent 4.5 Evaluating the Performance of a Classifier 187 of each other. Because the training and test sets are subsets of the original data, a class that is overrepresented in one subset will be underrepresented in the other, and vice versa. 4.5.2 Random Subsampling The holdout method can be repeated several times to improve the estimation of a classifier’s performance. This approach is known as random subsampling. Let acci be the model accuracy during the i th iteration. The overall accuracy is given by accsub = k i=1 acci/k. Random subsampling still encounters some of the problems associated with the holdout method because it does not utilize as much data as possible for training. It also has no control over the number of times each record is used for testing and training. Consequently, some records might be used for training more often than others. 4.5.3 Cross-Validation An alternative to random subsampling is cross-validation. In this approach, each record is used the same number of times for training and exactly once for testing. To illustrate this method, suppose we partition the data into two equal-sized subsets. First, we choose one of the subsets for training and the other for testing. We then swap the roles of the subsets so that the previous training set becomes the test set and vice versa. This approach is called a twofold cross-validation. The total error is obtained by summing up the errors for both runs. In this example, each record is used exactly once for training and once for testing. The k-fold cross-validation method generalizes this approach by segmenting the data into k equal-sized partitions. During each run, one of the partitions is chosen for testing, while the rest of them are used for training. This procedure is repeated k times so that each partition is used for testing exactly once. Again, the total error is found by summing up the errors for all k runs. A special case of the k-fold cross-validation method sets k = N, the size of the data set. In this so-called leave-one-out approach, each test set contains only one record. This approach has the advantage of utilizing as much data as possible for training. In addition, the test sets are mutually exclusive and they effectively cover the entire data set. The drawback of this approach is that it is computationally expensive to repeat the procedure N times. Furthermore, since each test set contains only one record, the variance of the estimated performance metric tends to be high. 188 Chapter 4 Classification 4.5.4 Bootstrap The methods presented so far assume that the training records are sampled without replacement. As a result, there are no duplicate records in the training and test sets. In the bootstrap approach, the training records are sampled with replacement; i.e., a record already chosen for training is put back into the original pool of records so that it is equally likely to be redrawn. If the original data has N records, it can be shown that, on average, a bootstrap sample of size N contains about 63.2% of the records in the original data. This approximation follows from the fact that the probability a record is chosen by a bootstrap sample is 1 − (1 − 1/N)N . When N is sufficiently large, the probability asymptotically approaches 1 − e−1 = 0.632. Records that are not included in the bootstrap sample become part of the test set. The model induced from the training set is then applied to the test set to obtain an estimate of the accuracy of the bootstrap sample, i. The sampling procedure is then repeated b times to generate b bootstrap samples. There are several variations to the bootstrap sampling approach in terms of how the overall accuracy of the classifier is computed. One of the more widely used approaches is the .632 bootstrap, which computes the overall accuracy by combining the accuracies of each bootstrap sample (i) with the accuracy computed from a training set that contains all the labeled examples in the original data (accs): Accuracy, accboot = 1","output":"Based on the new content provided, here is a list of the topics covered: 1.

However, depending on the size of the data, the observed difference in accuracy between two classifiers may not be statistically significant. This section examines some of the statistical tests available to compare the performance of different models and classifiers. For illustrative purposes, consider a pair of classification models, MA and MB. Suppose MA achieves 85% accuracy when evaluated on a test set containing 30 records, while MB achieves 75% accuracy on a different test set containing 5000 records. Based on this information, is MA a better model than MB? 4.6 Methods for Comparing Classifiers 189 The preceding example raises two key questions regarding the statistical significance of the performance metrics: 1. Although MA has a higher accuracy than MB, it was tested on a smaller test set. How much confidence can we place on the accuracy for MA? 2. Is it possible to explain the difference in accuracy as a result of variations in the composition of the test sets? The first question relates to the issue of estimating the confidence interval of a given model accuracy. The second question relates to the issue of testing the statistical significance of the observed deviation. These issues are investigated in the remainder of this section. 4.6.1 Estimating a Confidence Interval for Accuracy To determine the confidence interval, we need to establish the probability distribution that governs the accuracy measure. This section describes an approach for deriving the confidence interval by modeling the classification task as a binomial experiment. Following is a list of characteristics of a binomial experiment: 1. The experiment consists of N independent trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes: success or failure. 2. The probability of success, p, in each trial is constant. An example of a binomial experiment is counting the number of heads that turn up when a coin is flipped N times. If X is the number of successes observed in N trials, then the probability that X takes a particular value is given by a binomial distribution with mean N p and variance N p(1 − p): P(X = v) = N p pv(1 − p) N−v. For example, if the coin is fair (p = 0.5) and is flipped fifty times, then the probability that the head shows up 20 times is P(X = 20) = 50 20 0.520(1 − 0.5)30 = 0.0419. If the experiment is repeated many times, then the average number of heads expected to show up is 50×0.5 = 25, while its variance is 50×0.5×0.5 = 12.5. 190 Chapter 4 Classification The task of predicting the class labels of test records can also be considered as a binomial experiment. Given a test set that contains N records, let X be the number of records correctly predicted by a model and p be the true accuracy of the model. By modeling the prediction task as a binomial experiment, X has a binomial distribution with mean N p and variance N p(1 − p). It can be shown that the empirical accuracy, acc = X/N, also has a binomial distribution with mean p and variance p(1−p)/N (see Exercise 12). Although the binomial distribution can be used to estimate the confidence interval for acc, it is often approximated by a normal distribution when N is sufficiently large. Based on the normal distribution, the following confidence interval for acc can be derived: P − Zα/2 ≤ acc − p p(1 − p)/N ≤ Z1−α/2 = 1 − α, (4.12) where Zα/2 and Z1−α/2 are the upper and lower bounds obtained from a standard normal distribution at confidence level (1 − α). Since a standard normal distribution is symmetric around Z = 0, it follows that Zα/2 = Z1−α/2. Rearranging this inequality leads to the following confidence interval for p: 2 × N × acc + Z2 α/2 ± Zα/2 Z2 α/2 + 4N acc − 4N acc2 2(N + Z2 α/2) . (4.13) The following table shows the values of Zα/2 at different confidence levels: 1 − α 0.99 0.98 0.95 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.5 Zα/2 2.58 2.33 1.96 1.65 1.28 1.04 0.67 Example 4.4. Consider a model that has an accuracy of 80% when evaluated on 100 test records. What is the confidence interval for its true accuracy at a 95% confidence level? The confidence level of 95% corresponds to Zα/2 = 1.96 according to the table given above. Inserting this term into Equation 4.13 yields a confidence interval between 71.1% and 86.7%. The following table shows the confidence interval when the number of records, N, increases: N 20 50 100 500 1000 5000 Confidence 0.584 0.670 0.711 0.763 0.774 0.789 Interval − 0.919 − 0.888 − 0.867 − 0.833 − 0.824 − 0.811 Note that the confidence interval becomes tighter when N increases. 4.6 Methods for Comparing Classifiers 191 4.6.2 Comparing the Performance of Two Models Consider a pair of models, M1 and M2, that are evaluated on two independent test sets, D1 and D2. Let n1 denote the number of records in D1 and n2 denote the number of records in D2. In addition, suppose the error rate for M1 on D1 is e1 and the error rate for M2 on D2 is e2. Our goal is to test whether the observed difference between e1 and e2 is statistically significant. Assuming that n1 and n2 are sufficiently large, the error rates e1 and e2 can be approximated using normal distributions. If the observed difference in the error rate is denoted as d = e1 − e2, then d is also normally distributed with mean dt, its true difference, and variance, σ2 d. The variance of d can be computed as follows: σ2 d σ 2 d = e1(1 − e1) n1 + e2(1 − e2) n2 , (4.14) where e1(1 − e1)/n1 and e2(1 − e2)/n2 are the variances of the error rates. Finally, at the (1 − α)% confidence level, it can be shown that the confidence interval for the true difference dt is given by the following equation: dt = d ± zα/2σ d. (4.15) Example 4.5. Consider the problem described at the beginning of this section. Model MA has an error rate of e1 = 0.15 when applied to N1 = 30 test records, while model MB has an error rate of e2 = 0.25 when applied to N2 = 5000 test records. The observed difference in their error rates is d = |0.15 − 0.25| = 0.1. In this example, we are performing a two-sided test to check whether dt = 0 or dt = 0. The estimated variance of the observed difference in error rates can be computed as follows: σ 2 d = 0.15(1 − 0.15) 30 + 0.25(1 − 0.25) 5000 = 0.0043 or σ d = 0.0655. Inserting this value into Equation 4.15, we obtain the following confidence interval for dt at 95% confidence level: dt = 0.1 ± 1.96 × 0.0655 = 0.1 ± 0.128. As the interval spans the value zero, we can conclude that the observed difference is not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. 192 Chapter 4 Classification At what confidence level can we reject the hypothesis that dt = 0? To do this, we need to determine the value of Zα/2 such that the confidence interval for dt does not span the value zero. We can reverse the preceding computation and look for the value Zα/2 such that d>Zα/2σ d. Replacing the values of d and σ d gives Zα/2 < 1.527. This value first occurs when (1 − α) 0.936 (for a two-sided test). The result suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected at confidence level of 93.6% or lower. 4.6.3 Comparing the Performance of Two Classifiers Suppose we want to compare the performance of two classifiers using the k-fold cross-validation approach. Initially, the data set D is divided into k equal-sized partitions. We then apply each classifier to construct a model from k − 1 of the partitions and test it on the remaining partition. This step is repeated k times, each time using a different partition as the test set. Let Mij denote the model induced by classification technique Li during the jth iteration. Note that each pair of models M1j and M2j are tested on the same partition j. Let e1j and e2j be their respective error rates. The difference between their error rates during the jth fold can be written as dj = e1j − e2j . If k is sufficiently large, then dj is normally distributed with mean dcv t , which is the true difference in their error rates, and variance σcv. Unlike the previous approach, the overall variance in the observed differences is estimated using the following formula: σ 2 dcv = k j=1(dj − d)2 k(k − 1) , (4.16) where d is the average difference. For this approach, we need to use a tdistribution to compute the confidence interval for dcv t : dcv t = d ± t(1−α),k−1σ dcv . The coefficient t(1−α),k−1 is obtained from a probability table with two input parameters, its confidence level (1 − α) and the number of degrees of freedom, k − 1. The probability table for the t-distribution is shown in Table 4.6. Example 4.6. Suppose the estimated difference in the accuracy of models generated by two classification techniques has a mean equal to 0.05 and a standard deviation equal to 0.002. If the accuracy is estimated using a 30-fold cross-validation approach, then at a 95% confidence level, the true accuracy difference is dcv t = 0.05 ± 2.04 × 0.002.

For example, the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress classification systems were designed to catalog and index the vast number of library books. The categories are typically identified in a manual fashion, with the help of domain experts. Automated classification has been a subject of intensive research for many years. The study of classification in classical statistics is sometimes known as discriminant analysis, where the objective is to predict the group membership of an object based on a set of predictor variables. A well-known classical method is Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis [117], which seeks to find a linear projection of the data that produces the greatest discrimination between objects that belong to different classes. Many pattern recognition problems also require the discrimination of objects from different classes. Examples include speech recognition, handwritten character identification, and image classification. Readers who are interested in the application of classification techniques for pattern recognition can refer to the survey articles by Jain et al. [122] and Kulkarni et al. [128] or classic pattern recognition books by Bishop [107], Duda et al. [114], and Fukunaga [118]. The subject of classification is also a major research topic in the fields of neural networks, statistical learning, and machine learning. An in-depth treat- 194 Chapter 4 Classification ment of various classification techniques is given in the books by Cherkassky and Mulier [112], Hastie et al. [120], Michie et al. [133], and Mitchell [136]. An overview of decision tree induction algorithms can be found in the survey articles by Buntine [110], Moret [137], Murthy [138], and Safavian et al. [147]. Examples of some well-known decision tree algorithms include CART [108], ID3 [143], C4.5 [145], and CHAID [125]. Both ID3 and C4.5 employ the entropy measure as their splitting function. An in-depth discussion of the C4.5 decision tree algorithm is given by Quinlan [145]. Besides explaining the methodology for decision tree growing and tree pruning, Quinlan [145] also described how the algorithm can be modified to handle data sets with missing values. The CART algorithm was developed by Breiman et al. [108] and uses the Gini index as its splitting function. CHAID [125] uses the statistical χ2 test to determine the best split during the tree-growing process. The decision tree algorithm presented in this chapter assumes that the splitting condition is specified one attribute at a time. An oblique decision tree can use multiple attributes to form the attribute test condition in the internal nodes [121, 152]. Breiman et al. [108] provide an option for using linear combinations of attributes in their CART implementation. Other approaches for inducing oblique decision trees were proposed by Heath et al. [121], Murthy et al. [139], Cant´u-Paz and Kamath [111], and Utgoff and Brodley [152]. Although oblique decision trees help to improve the expressiveness of a decision tree representation, learning the appropriate test condition at each node is computationally challenging. Another way to improve the expressiveness of a decision tree without using oblique decision trees is to apply a method known as constructive induction [132]. This method simplifies the task of learning complex splitting functions by creating compound features from the original attributes. Besides the top-down approach, other strategies for growing a decision tree include the bottom-up approach by Landeweerd et al. [130] and Pattipati and Alexandridis [142], as well as the bidirectional approach by Kim and Landgrebe [126]. Schuermann and Doster [150] and Wang and Suen [154] proposed using a soft splitting criterion to address the data fragmentation problem. In this approach, each record is assigned to different branches of the decision tree with different probabilities. Model overfitting is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure that a decision tree classifier performs equally well on previously unknown records. The model overfitting problem has been investigated by many authors including Breiman et al. [108], Schaffer [148], Mingers [135], and Jensen and Cohen [123]. While the presence of noise is often regarded as one of the Bibliography 195 primary reasons for overfitting [135, 140], Jensen and Cohen [123] argued that overfitting is the result of using incorrect hypothesis tests in a multiple comparison procedure. Schapire [149] defined generalization error as “the probability of misclassifying a new example” and test error as “the fraction of mistakes on a newly sampled test set.” Generalization error can therefore be considered as the expected test error of a classifier. Generalization error may sometimes refer to the true error [136] of a model, i.e., its expected error for randomly drawn data points from the same population distribution where the training set is sampled. These definitions are in fact equivalent if both the training and test sets are gathered from the same population distribution, which is often the case in many data mining and machine learning applications. The Occam’s razor principle is often attributed to the philosopher William of Occam. Domingos [113] cautioned against the pitfall of misinterpreting Occam’s razor as comparing models with similar training errors, instead of generalization errors. A survey on decision tree-pruning methods to avoid overfitting is given by Breslow and Aha [109] and Esposito et al. [116]. Some of the typical pruning methods include reduced error pruning [144], pessimistic error pruning [144], minimum error pruning [141], critical value pruning [134], cost-complexity pruning [108], and error-based pruning [145]. Quinlan and Rivest proposed using the minimum description length principle for decision tree pruning in [146]. Kohavi [127] had performed an extensive empirical study to compare the performance metrics obtained using different estimation methods such as random subsampling, bootstrapping, and k-fold cross-validation. Their results suggest that the best estimation method is based on the ten-fold stratified cross-validation. Efron and Tibshirani [115] provided a theoretical and empirical comparison between cross-validation and a bootstrap method known as the 632+ rule. Current techniques such as C4.5 require that the entire training data set fit into main memory. There has been considerable effort to develop parallel and scalable versions of decision tree induction algorithms. Some of the proposed algorithms include SLIQ by Mehta et al. [131], SPRINT by Shafer et al. [151], CMP by Wang and Zaniolo [153], CLOUDS by Alsabti et al. [106], RainForest by Gehrke et al. [119], and ScalParC by Joshi et al. [124]. A general survey of parallel algorithms for data mining is available in [129]. 196 Chapter 4 Classification Bibliography [106] K. Alsabti, S. Ranka, and V. Singh.

Decision trees for Exercise 9. 4.8 Exercises 203 Compute the total description length of each decision tree according to the minimum description length principle. • The total description length of a tree is given by: Cost(tree, data) = Cost(tree) + Cost(data|tree). • Each internal node of the tree is encoded by the ID of the splitting attribute. If there are m attributes, the cost of encoding each attribute is log2 m bits. • Each leaf is encoded using the ID of the class it is associated with. If there are k classes, the cost of encoding a class is log2 k bits. • Cost(tree) is the cost of encoding all the nodes in the tree. To simplify the computation, you can assume that the total cost of the tree is obtained by adding up the costs of encoding each internal node and each leaf node. • Cost(data|tree) is encoded using the classification errors the tree commits on the training set. Each error is encoded by log2 n bits, where n is the total number of training instances. Which decision tree is better, according to the MDL principle? 10. While the .632 bootstrap approach is useful for obtaining a reliable estimate of model accuracy, it has a known limitation [127]. Consider a two-class problem, where there are equal number of positive and negative examples in the data. Suppose the class labels for the examples are generated randomly. The classifier used is an unpruned decision tree (i.e., a perfect memorizer). Determine the accuracy of the classifier using each of the following methods. (a) The holdout method, where two-thirds of the data are used for training and the remaining one-third are used for testing. (b) Ten-fold cross-validation. (c) The .632 bootstrap method. (d) From the results in parts (a), (b), and (c), which method provides a more reliable evaluation of the classifier’s accuracy? 11. Consider the following approach for testing whether a classifier A beats another classifier B. Let N be the size of a given data set, pA be the accuracy of classifier A, pB be the accuracy of classifier B, and p = (pA + pB)/2 be the average accuracy for both classifiers. To test whether classifier A is significantly better than B, the following Z-statistic is used: Z = pA − pB 2p(1−p) N . Classifier A is assumed to be better than classifier B if Z > 1.96. 204 Chapter 4 Classification Table 4.9 compares the accuracies of three different classifiers, decision tree classifiers, na¨ıve Bayes classifiers, and support vector machines, on various data sets.

Throughout this lecture we assume a regression setting, i.e. . In this lecture we will decompose the generalization error of a classifier into three rather interpretable terms. Before we do that, let us consider that for any given input there might not exist a unique label . For example, if your vector describes features of house (e.g. #bedrooms, square footage, ...) and the label its price, you could imagine two houses with identical description selling for different prices. So for any given feature vector , there is a distribution over possible labels. We therefore define the following, which will come in useful later on: Expected Label (given ): The expected label denotes the label you would expect to obtain, given a feature vector . Alright, so we draw our training set , consisting of inputs, i.i.d. from the distribution . As a second step we typically call some machine learning algorithm on this data set to learn a hypothesis (aka classifier). Formally, we denote this process as . For a given , learned on data set with algorithm , we can compute the generalization error (as measured in squared loss) as follows: Expected Test Error (given ): Note that one can use other loss functions. We use squared loss because it has nice mathematical properties, and it is also the most common loss function. The previous statement is true for a given training set . However, remember that itself is drawn from , and is therefore a random variable. Further, is a function of , and is therefore also a random variable. And we can of course compute its expectation: Expected Classifier (given ): D = {(x1, y1),…,(xn, yn)} P(X, Y ) y ∈ R x y x y x x ∈ R d y¯(x) = E [Y ] = y Pr(y|x)∂y. y|x ∫ y x D n P A hD = A(D) hD D A hD E [ ] = Pr(x, y)∂y∂x.

We can also use the fact that is a random variable to compute the expected test error only given , taking the expectation also over . Expected Test Error (given ): To be clear, is our training points and the pairs are the test points. We are interested in exactly this expression, because it evaluates the quality of a machine learning algorithm with respect to a data distribution . In the following we will show that this expression decomposes into three meaningful terms. Decomposition of Expected Test Error The middle term of the above equation is as we show below Returning to the earlier expression, we're left with the variance and another term We can break down the second term in the above equation as follows: The third term in the equation above is , as we show below This gives us the decomposition of expected test error as follows Variance: Captures how much your classifier changes if you train on a different training set.

This is due to your classifier being \\"biased\\" to a particular kind of solution (e.g. linear classifier). In other words, bias is inherent to your model. Noise: How big is the data-intrinsic noise? This error measures ambiguity due to your data distribution and feature representation. You can never beat this, it is an aspect of the data. Fig 1: Graphical illustration of bias and variance. Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html Fig 2: The variation of Bias and Variance with the model complexity. This is similar to the concept of overfitting and underfitting. More complex models overfit while the simplest models underfit. Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html Detecting High Bias and High Variance If a classifier is under-performing (e.g. if the test or training error is too high), there are several ways to improve performance. To find out which of these many techniques is the right one for the situation, the first step is to determine the root of the problem. Figure 3: Test and training error as the number of training instances increases. The graph above plots the training error and the test error and can be divided into two overarching regimes. In the first regime (on the left side of the graph), training error is below the desired error threshold (denoted by ), but test error is significantly higher. In the second regime (on the right side of the graph), test error is remarkably close to training error, but both are above the desired tolerance of . Regime 1 (High Variance) In the first regime, the cause of the poor performance is high variance. Symptoms: 1. Training error is much lower than test error 2. Training error is lower than 3. Test error is above Remedies: Add more training data Reduce model complexity -- complex models are prone to high variance Bagging (will be covered later in the course) Regime 2 (High Bias) Unlike the first regime, the second regime indicates high bias: the model being used is not robust enough to produce an accurate prediction. Symptoms: 1. Training error is higher than Remedies: Use more complex model (e.g. kernelize, use non-linear models) Add features Boosting (will be covered later in the course) ϵ ϵ ϵ ϵ ϵ Home Aarshay Jain — Updated On September 15th, 2023 Algorithm Data Science Intermediate Machine Learning Python Regression Statistics Structured Data Supervised Master the Art of Data Science: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming an Industry-Ready Data Scientist Download Roadmap × Last week, I saw a recorded talk at NYC Data Science Academy from Owen Zhang, Chief Product Officer at DataRobot. He said, ‘if you are using regression without regularization, you have to be very special!’. I hope you get what a person of his stature referred to. I understood it very well and decided to explore regularization techniques in detail. In this article, I have explained the complex science behind ‘Ridge Regression‘ and ‘Lasso Regression, ‘ which are the most fundamental regularization techniques used in data science, sadly still not used by many.

Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time. A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials, which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand.

When we talk about regression, we often end up discussing Linear and Logistic Regression, as they are the most popular of the 7 types of regressions. In this article, we’ll focus on Ridge and Lasso regression, which are powerful techniques generally used for creating parsimonious models in the presence of a ‘large’ number of features. Here ‘large’ can typically mean either of two things: 1. Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting) 2. Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in the case of millions or billions of features. Though Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. If you’ve heard of them before, you must know that they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features and minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called ‘regularization’ techniques. Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). Regularization Techniques The key difference is in how they assign penalties to the coefficients: 1. Ridge Regression: 1. Performs L2 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of square of coefficients) 2. Lasso Regression: 1. Performs L1 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the absolute value ofthe magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of the absolute value of coefficients) Here, LS Obj refers to the ‘least squares objective,’ i.e., the linear regression objective without regularization. If terms like ‘penalty’ and ‘regularization’ seem very unfamiliar to you, don’t worry; we’ll discuss these in more detail throughout this article. Before digging further into how they work, let’s try to understand why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should work in the first place. Why Penalize the Magnitude of Coefficients? Let’s try to understand the impact of model complexity on the magnitude of coefficients. As an example, I have simulated a sine curve (between 60° and 300°) and added some random noise using the following code: Python Code @shivanshkausha/Ridge_and_Lasso_Regression_jan-28-2016 A Nix repl by shivanshkausha Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 34 SH This resembles a sine curve but not exactly because of the noise. We’ll use this as an example to test different scenarios in this article. Let’s try to estimate the sine function using polynomial regression with powers of x from 1 to 15. Let’s add a column for each power upto 15 in our dataframe. This can be accomplished using the following code: Add a Column for Each Power upto 15 for i in range(2,16): #power of 1 is already there colname = 'x_%d'%i #new var will be x_power data[colname] = data['x']**i print(data.head())add a column for each power upto 15 The dataframe looks like this: Making 15 Different Linear Regression Models Now that we have all the 15 powers, let’s make 15 different linear regression models, with each model containing variables with powers of x from 1 to the particular model number. For example, the feature set of model 8 will be – {x, x_2, x_3, …, x_8}. First, we’ll define a generic function that takes in the required maximum power of x as an input and returns a list containing – [ model RSS, intercept, coef_x, coef_x2, … upto entered power ]. Here RSS refers to the ‘Residual Sum of Squares,’ which is nothing but the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values in the training data set and is known as the cost function or the loss function. The python code defining the function is: #Import Linear Regression model from scikit-learn. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression def linear_regression(data, power, models_to_plot): #initialize predictors: predictors=['x'] if power>=2: predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,power+1)]) #Fit the model linreg = LinearRegression(normalize=True) linreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = linreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered power if power in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[power]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for power: %d'%power) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([linreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(linreg.coef_) return ret Note that this function will not plot the model fit for all the powers but will return the RSS and coefficient values for all the models. I’ll skip the details of the code for now to maintain brevity. I’ll be happy to discuss the same through the comments below if required. Store allthe Results in Pandas Dataframe Now, we can make all 15 models and compare the results. For ease of analysis, we’ll store all the results in a Pandas dataframe and plot 6 models to get an idea of the trend. Consider the following code: #Initialize a dataframe to store the results: col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['model_pow_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] coef_matrix_simple = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the powers for which a plot is required: models_to_plot = {1:231,3:232,6:233,9:234,12:235,15:236} #Iterate through all powers and assimilate results for i in range(1,16): coef_matrix_simple.iloc[i-1,0:i+2] = linear_regression(data, power=i, models_to_plot=models_to_plot) We would expect the models with increasing complexity to better fit the data and result in lower RSS values. This can be verified by looking at the plots generated for 6 models: This clearly aligns with our initial understanding. As the model complexity increases, the models tend to fit even smaller deviations in the training data set. Though this leads to overfitting, let’s keep this issue aside for some time and come to our main objective, i.e., the impact on the magnitude of coefficients. This can be analyzed by looking at the data frame created above. Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_simple The output looks like this: It is clearly evident that the size of coefficients increases exponentially with an increase in model complexity. I hope this gives some intuition into why putting a constraint on the magnitude of coefficients can be a good idea to reduce model complexity. Let’s try to understand this even better. What does a large coefficient signify? It means that we’re putting a lot of emphasis on that feature, i.e., the particular feature is a good predictor for the outcome. When it becomes too large, the algorithm starts modeling intricate relations to estimate the output and ends up overfitting the particular training data. I hope the concept is clear. Now, let’s understand ridge and lasso regression in detail and see how well they work for the same problem. How Does Ridge Regression Work? As mentioned before, ridge regression performs ‘L2 regularization‘, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of squares of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, ridge regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe square of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) is the parameter that balances the amount of emphasis given to minimizing RSS vs minimizing the sum of squares of coefficients. α can take various values: 1. α = 0: 1. The objective becomes the same as simple linear regression. 2. We’ll get the same coefficients as simple linear regression. 2. α = ∞: 1. The coefficients will be zero. Why? Because of infinite weightage on the square of coefficients, anything less than zero will make the objective infinite. 3. 0 < α < ∞: 1. The magnitude of α will decide the weightage given to different parts of the objective. 2. The coefficients will be somewhere between 0 and ones for simple linear regression. I hope this gives some sense of how α would impact the magnitude of coefficients. One thing is for sure – any non-zero value would give values less than that of simple linear regression. By how much? We’ll find out soon. Leaving the mathematical details for later, let’s see ridge regression in action on the same problem as above. Function for Ridge Regression First, let’s define a generic function for ridge regression similar to the one defined for simple linear regression. The Python code is: from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge def ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model ridgereg = Ridge(alpha=alpha,normalize=True) ridgereg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = ridgereg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([ridgereg.intercept_]) ret.extend(ridgereg.coef_) return ret Note the ‘Ridge’ function used here. It takes ‘alpha’ as a parameter on initialization. Also, keep in mind that normalizing the inputs is generally a good idea in every type of regression and should be used in the case of ridge regression as well. Now, let’s analyze the result of Ridge regression for 10 different values of α ranging from 1e-15 to 20. These values have been chosen so that we can easily analyze the trend with changes in values of α. These would, however, differ from case to case. Note that each of these 10 models will contain all the 15 variables, and only the value of alpha would differ. This differs from the simple linear regression case, where each model had a subset of features. Python Code #Initialize predictors to be set of 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Set the different values of alpha to be tested alpha_ridge = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10, 20] #Initialize the dataframe for storing coefficients. col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_ridge[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_ridge = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) models_to_plot = {1e-15:231, 1e-10:232, 1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 5:236} for i in range(10): coef_matrix_ridge.iloc[i,] = ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha_ridge[i], models_to_plot) This would generate the following plot: Here we can clearly observe that as the value of alpha increases, the model complexity reduces. Though higher values of alpha reduce overfitting, significantly high values can cause underfitting as well (e.g., alpha = 5). Thus alpha should be chosen wisely. A widely accepted technique is cross-validation, i.e., the value of alpha is iterated over a range of values, and the one giving a higher cross-validation score is chosen. Let’s have a look at the value of coefficients in the above models: Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_ridge The table looks like: This straight away gives us the following inferences: 1. The RSS increases with an increase in alpha. 2. An alpha value as small as 1e-15 gives us a significant reduction in the magnitude of coefficients. How? Compare the coefficients in the first row of this table to the last row of the simple linear regression table. 3. High alpha values can lead to significant underfitting. Note the rapid increase in RSS for values of alpha greater than 1 4. Though the coefficients are really small, they are NOT zero. The first 3 are very intuitive. But #4 is also a crucial observation. Let’s reconfirm the same by determining the number of zeros in each row of the coefficients data set: Python Code coef_matrix_ridge.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: This confirms that all 15 coefficients are greater than zero in magnitude (can be +ve or -ve). Remember this observation and have a look again until it’s clear. This will play an important role later while comparing ridge with lasso regression. How Does Lasso Regression Work? LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I know it doesn’t give much of an idea, but there are 2 keywords here – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection. ‘ Let’s consider the former first and worry about the latter later. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of the absolute value of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, lasso regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe absolute value of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) works similar to that of the ridge and provides a trade-off between balancing RSS and the magnitude of coefficients. Like that of the ridge, α can take various values. Let’s iterate it here briefly: 1. α = 0: Same coefficients as simple linear regression 2. α = ∞: All coefficients zero (same logic as before) 3. 0 < α < ∞: coefficients between 0 and that of simple linear regression Defining Generic Function Yes, its appearing to be very similar to Ridge till now. But hang on with me, and you’ll know the difference by the time we finish. Like before, let’s run lasso regression on the same problem as above. First, we’ll define a generic function: from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso def lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model lassoreg = Lasso(alpha=alpha,normalize=True, max_iter=1e5) lassoreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = lassoreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([lassoreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(lassoreg.coef_) return ret Notice the additional parameters defined in the Lasso function – ‘max_iter. ‘ This is the maximum number of iterations for which we want the model to run if it doesn’t converge before. This exists for Ridge as well, but setting this to a higher than default value was required in this case. Why?I’ll come to this in the next section. Different Values of Alpha Let’s check the output for 10 different values of alpha using the following code: #Initialize predictors to all 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Define the alpha values to test alpha_lasso = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-5,1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10] #Initialize the dataframe to store coefficients col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_lasso[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_lasso = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the models to plot models_to_plot = {1e-10:231, 1e-5:232,1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 1:236} #Iterate over the 10 alpha values: for i in range(10): coef_matrix_lasso.iloc[i,] = lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha_lasso[i], models_to_plot) This gives us the following plots: This again tells us that the model complexity decreases with an increase in the values of alpha. But notice the straight line at alpha=1. Appears a bit strange to me. Let’s explore this further by looking at the coefficients: Apart from the expected inference of higher RSS for higher alphas, we can see the following: 1. For the same values of alpha, the coefficients of lasso regression are much smaller than that of ridge regression (compare row 1 of the 2 tables). 2. For the same alpha, lasso has higher RSS (poorer fit) as compared to ridge regression. 3. Many of the coefficients are zero, even for very small values of alpha. Inferences #1 and 2 might not always generalize but will hold for many cases. The real difference from the ridge is coming out in the last inference. Let’s check the number of coefficients that are zero in each model using the following code: coef_matrix_lasso.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: We can observe that even for a small value of alpha, a significant number of coefficients are zero. This also explains the horizontal line fit for alpha=1 in the lasso plots; it’s just a baseline model! This phenomenon of most of the coefficients being zero is called ‘sparsity. ‘ Although lasso performs feature selection, this level of sparsity is achieved in special cases only, which we’ll discuss towards the end. This has some really interesting implications on the use cases of lasso regression as compared to that of ridge regression. But before coming to the final comparison, let’s take a bird’s eye view of the mathematics behind why coefficients are zero in the case of lasso but not ridge. Python Code @LakshayArora1/Regularisation - Big Mart Sales A Python repl by LakshayArora1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 8 LA Some Underlying Mathematical Principles Here’s a sneak peek into some of the underlying mathematical principles of regression. If you wish to get into the details, I recommend taking a good statistics textbook, like Elements of Statistical Learning. Let’s start by reviewing the basic structure of data in a regression problem. In this infographic, you can see there are 4 data elements: 1. X: the matrix of input features (nrow: N, ncol: M+1) 2. Y: the actual outcome variable (length:N) 3. Yhat: these are predicted values of Y (length:N) 4. W: the weights or the coefficients (length: M+1) Here, N is the total number of data points available, and M is the total number of features. X has M+1 columns because of M features and 1 intercept. The predicted outcome for any data point i is: It is simply the weighted sum of each data point with coefficients as the weights. This prediction is achieved by finding the optimum value of weights based on certain criteria, which depends on the type of regression algorithm being used. Let’s consider all 3 cases: Simple Linear Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is just the RSS (Residual Sum of Squares), i.e., the sum of squared errors of the predicted outcome as compared to the actual outcome. This can be depicted mathematically as: In order to minimize this cost, we generally use a ‘gradient descent’ algorithm. The overall algorithm works like this: 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 determine the gradient 2.1.2 update the jth weight by subtracting learning rate times the gradient w(t+1) = w(t) - learning rate * gradient Here the important step is #2.1.1, where we compute the gradient. A gradient is nothing but a partial differential of the cost with respect to a particular weight (denoted as wj). The gradient for the jth weight will be: This is formed from 2 parts: 1. 2*{..}: This is formed because we’ve differentiated the square of the term in {..} 2. -wj: This is the differentiation of the part in {..} wrt wj. Since it’s a summation, all others would become 0, and only wj would remain. Step #2.1.2 involves updating the weights using the gradient. This updating step for simple linear regression looks like this: Note the +ve sign in the RHS is formed after the multiplication of 2 -ve signs. I would like to explain point #2 of the gradient descent algorithm mentioned above, ‘iterate till not converged.‘ Here convergence refers to attaining the optimum solution within the pre-defined limit. It is checked using the value of the gradient. If the gradient is small enough, it means we are very close to the optimum, and further iterations won’t substantially impact the coefficients. The lower limit on the gradient can be changed using the ‘tol‘ parameter. Let’s consider the case of ridge regression now. Ridge Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of squares of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient would be: Again in the regularization part of a gradient, only w remains, and all others would become zero. The corresponding update rule is: j Here we can see that the second part of the RHS is the same as that of simple linear regression. Thus, ridge regression is equivalent to reducing the weight by a factor of (1-2λη) first and then applying the same update rule as simple linear regression. I hope this explains why the coefficients get reduced to small numbers but never become zero. Note that the criteria for convergence, in this case, remains similar to simple linear regression, i.e., checking the value of gradients. Let’s discuss Lasso regression now. Lasso Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of the absolute value of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient is not defined as the absolute function is not differentiable at x=0. This can be illustrated as: We can see that the parts on the left and right sides of 0 are straight lines with defined derivates, but the function can’t be differentiated at x=0. In this case, we have to use a different technique called coordinate descent, which is based on the concept of sub-gradients. One of the coordinate descent follows the following algorithms (this is also the default in sklearn): 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 update the jth weight with a value which minimizes the cost #2.1.1 might look too generalized. But I’m intentionally leaving the details and jumping to the update rule: Difference Between Actual and Predicted Outcome Here g(w-j) represents (but not exactly) the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome considering all EXCEPT the jth variable. If this value is small, it means that the algorithm is able to predict the outcome fairly well even without the jth variable, and thus it can be removed from the equation by setting a zero coefficient. This gives us some intuition into why the coefficients become zero in the case of lasso regression. In coordinate descent, checking convergence is another issue. Since gradients are not defined, we need an alternate method. Many alternatives exist, but the simplest one is to check the step size of the algorithm. We can check the maximum difference in weights in any particular cycle overall feature weights (#2.1 of the algorithm above). If this is lower than the specified ‘tol,’ the algorithm will stop. The convergence is not as fast as the gradient descent. If a warning appears saying that the algorithm stopped before convergence, we might have to set the ‘max_iter’ parameter. This is why I specified this parameter in the Lasso generic function. Let’s summarize our understanding by comparing the coefficients in all the three cases using the following visual, which shows how the ridge and lasso coefficients behave in comparison to the simple linear regression case. Reinforced Facts Apologies for the lack of visual appeal. But I think it is good enough to re-inforced the following facts: 1. The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and thus never attain zero values but very small values. 2. The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge. Before going further, one important issue in the case of both ridge and lasso regression is intercept handling. Generally, regularizing the intercept is not a good idea and should be left out of regularization. This requires slight changes in the implementation, which I’ll leave you to explore. Comparison Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression Now that we have a fair idea of how ridge and lasso regression work, let’s try to consolidate our understanding by comparing them and appreciating their specific use cases. I will also compare them with some alternate approaches. Let’s analyze these under three buckets: Key Difference Ridge: It includes all (or none) of the features in the model. Thus, the major advantage of ridge regression is coefficient shrinkage and reducing model complexity. Lasso: Along with shrinking coefficients, the lasso also performs feature selection. (Remember the ‘selection‘ in the lasso full-form?) As we observed earlier, some of the coefficients become exactly zero, which is equivalent to the particular feature being excluded from the model. Traditionally, techniques like stepwise regression were used to perform feature selection and make parsimonious models. But with advancements in Machine-Learning, ridge and lasso regressions provide very good alternatives as they give much better output, require fewer tuning parameters, and can be automated to a large extent. Typical Use Cases Ridge: It is majorly used to prevent overfitting. Since it includes all the features, it is not very useful in the case of exorbitantly high #features, say in millions, as it will pose computational challenges. Lasso: Since it provides sparse solutions, it is generally the model of choice (or some variant of this concept) for modeling cases where the #features are in millions or more. In such a case, getting a sparse solution is of great computational advantage as the features with zero coefficients can be ignored. It’s not hard to see why the stepwise selection techniques become practically cumbersome to implement in highdimensionality cases. Thus, the lasso provides a significant advantage. Presence of Highly Correlated Features Ridge: It generally works well even in the presence of highly correlated features, as it will include all of them in the model. Still, the coefficients will be distributed among them depending on the correlation. Lasso: It arbitrarily selects any feature among the highly correlated ones and reduces the coefficients of the rest to zero. Also, the chosen variable changes randomly with changes in model parameters. This generally doesn’t work that well as compared to ridge regression. This disadvantage of the lasso can be observed in the example we discussed above. Since we used a polynomial regression, the variables were highly correlated. (Not sure why? Check the output of data.corr() ). Thus, we saw that even small values of alpha were giving significant sparsity (i.e., high #coefficients as zero). Along with Ridge and Lasso, Elastic Net is another useful technique that combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It can be used to balance out the pros and cons of ridge and lasso regression. I encourage you to explore it further. Conclusion In this article, we got an overview of regularization using ridge and lasso regression. We then found out why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should give us parsimonious models. Next, we went into details of ridge and lasso regression and saw their advantages over simple linear regression. We also understood how and why they should work. We also peeked into the mathematical part of the regressions. Regularization techniques are really useful, and I encourage you to implement them. If you’re ready to take the challenge, you must try them on the BigMart Sales Prediction problem discussed at the beginning of this article. Key Takeaways Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In Python, scikit-learn provides easy-to-use functions for implementing Ridge and Lasso regression with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity in the input data by reducing the impact of correlated features on the coefficients, while Lasso regression automatically selects the most important features for prediction. Frequently Asked Questions Q1. Whatis ridge and lasso regression? A. Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques in machine learning. Ridge adds L2 regularization, and Lasso adds L1 to linear regression models, preventing overfitting. Q2. When to use ridge regression and when to use lasso regression? A. Use Ridge when you have many correlated predictors and want to avoid multicollinearity. Use Lasso when feature selection is crucial or when you want a sparse model. 54 thoughts on \\"Ridge and Lasso Regression in Python | Complete Tutorial (Updated 2023)\\" Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury says: January 28, 2016 at 8:26 pm Good read, liked the way you explained why weight constraining is essential for regularization. Can you also perform the same experiments on Elastic Net and update this blog? Reply Q3. Whatis the difference between ridge regression and lasso bias? A. Ridge Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, while Lasso adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which can lead to variable selection. Q4. Why do we use ridge and lasso? A. Ridge and Lasso are used to prevent overfitting in regression models by adding regularization terms to the cost function, encouraging simpler models with fewer predictors and more generalizability. cost function Elastic Net L1 regularization L2 regularization lasso regression linear regression live coding logistic regression overfitting penalizing coefficients regression regression coefficients regularization Residual sum of squares ridge regression total sum of squares Aboutthe Author Aarshay Jain Aarshay graduated from MS in Data Science at Columbia University in 2017 and is currently an ML Engineer at Spotify New York.

Blending the aesthetics of Half-Life 2 with manga creates a unique space for storytelling and visual design. When describing your main character's outfit, consider both the practical aspects of the Half-Life universe and the stylization common in manga. You might start with a functional base reminiscent of Half-Life 2's protagonist, Gordon Freeman, or you could design a new outfit that fits within the game's world. Here's a rough idea to play with: - **HEV Suit Influence**: If your main character has a link to the science teams or the resistance, they might wear a variant of the Hazardous Environment (HEV) suit. It could have the iconic orange and gray color scheme but be adjusted for the character's personal style—the manga adaptation might feature a more fitted look or stylized armor plates. - **Resistance Gear**: Should your character be a member of the resistance, their outfit might be rugged and utilitarian. Think cargo pants, combat boots, and tactical vests, all adorned with patches or insignia that show allegiance to the anti-Combine forces. The vest could have pockets for ammunition, multi-tools, or scavenged technology. - **Headwear**: The character could wear a headset or goggles on their forehead, reminiscent of the gear worn by various characters in the game. Alternatively, they might have a unique hat or helmet signifying their role or rank within the resistance. - **Accessories and Weapons**: The character might carry iconic Half-Life weapons like the crowbar or gravity gun, either visibly strapped to their outfit or in dynamic manga-style action poses. Other accessories like bandoliers, gloves with exposed fingers, or a backpack with various attachments could enhance the look. - **A Touch of Personality**: Since manga characters often have distinctive visual quirks, consider adding something unique that sets your character apart. It could be a specific color highlight, a scarf, a badge, or even a particular hairstyle that peeks out from under their headwear. Remember to integrate elements that will resonate with fans of Half-Life 2 while keeping the flair of manga aesthetics. Detailed linework, expressive features, and dynamic clothing movement are all hallmarks of the manga style that can make your character vivid and memorable. Good luck with your Half-Life 2 styled manga, and have fun creating your main character's outfit!"},{"instruction":"So the main character's outfit is sort of like a combination of the HEV suit from the Half-Life games and a military MOPP suit. His suit has some metallic parts, such as his helmet, power supply on his back and some sort of blue core on his chest piece.","output":"That's an interesting combination that would certainly make your main character stand out. Let's expand on this concept: - **Helmet Design**: The helmet could take inspiration from the HEV suit's design, perhaps with a retractable visor that hints at advanced technology. The metallic aspect could imply added protection and incorporate HUD (Heads-Up Display) elements, which are common in both Half-Life and military tech aesthetics. The visor might even have a blue glow to match the core on his chest, indicating some sort of integrated system. - **Power Supply**: The power supply on the back could resemble a compact, high-tech backpack with glowing elements, similar to the energy cells seen on Combine soldiers or technology in Half-Life 2. It can have pipes or cables feeding into the suit, underlining its function as a life-support or enhancement system. - **Chest Core**: The blue core on the chest piece could be a standout visual element symbolizing the suit's power or the character's unique capabilities. This could be designed to look like a small reactor or capacitor, with a detailed, almost arcane design that suggests advanced, possibly alien technology. It might even pulse with light or energy, an effect that would translate well into the highly stylized world of manga. - **MOPP Suit Influence**: The MOPP (Military Protective Outfit) influence might come through in the suit's practical aspects, like its sealed nature against hazardous environments, pockets for gear and supplies, and rugged fabric in areas not covered by metal for flexibility and movement. However, since this is manga, you can stylize these details to be more streamlined and visually appealing, perhaps with intentional tears or battle damage to suggest a history of action. - **Metallic Parts**: These could be drawn with crisp, reflective shading to show their sturdy nature, giving the character a robust presence. The metal might bear insignias or markings that show rank, allegiance, or personal history. The metallic parts could also offer a contrast with the rest of the suit's more flexible material, highlighting the fusion of human ingenuity and alien tech that's often a theme in Half-Life. - **Color Coordination**: With the suit having both metallic and non-metallic parts, using a cohesive color palette can unify the design. The signature HEV orange might feature as a trim or a secondary color, alongside shades of gray, black, and the distinctive blue glow for technological elements. By combining the pragmatic aspects of military gear with the aesthetic and technological concepts from the Half-Life universe, and expressing them through the lens of manga's dramatic styling, you'll be able to create a unique and visually arresting protagonist for your manga."},{"instruction":"Their helmet has a integrated gas mask, their suit's color is red and made out of metal and asbestos.","output":"Given these specific details, you are crafting an intriguing character with a suit built for extreme conditions, likely intended for combat within the hazardous environments depicted in the Half-Life universe. - **Integrated Gas Mask**: This implies that your character is prepared for chemical, biological, or possibly extraterrestrial threats. The gas mask component should be seamlessly incorporated into the helmet's design, perhaps with filters on the sides or front that could be stylized to fit the overall aesthetic. This feature might also be represented with tubes or respiratory systems that are connected to the suit, helping to recycle air and provide the character with a steady oxygen supply. - **Red Color and Metal**: A red-colored suit made of metal would stand out and could be reflective of the character's role or personality—red often symbolizes danger, passion, or power. You could incorporate various shades of red to provide depth and detail to the metallic parts. Metallic sheen and sharp highlights can showcase the suit's sturdy nature in illustrations, while the more matte-textured areas could suggest asbestos components. - **Asbestos Components**: This distinctive feature adds a functional layer, as asbestos is known for its heat-resistant properties. In the context of the suit, it could serve as insulation against fire, explosions, or other high-temperature hazards. Visually, these parts could be depicted with a different texture compared to the metal, such as a tough, fibrous look that contrasts with the smooth, reflective metallic surfaces. For creative license, you could emphasize this characteristic to make the suit impervious to certain types of energy or weapons seen in the Half-Life universe. - **Stylization and Detailing**: The manga style allows for artistic flair, so you can add further detailed lines or patterns to the metalwork, suggesting advanced engineering or even alien influences in the construction of the suit. The design can highlight important components like the blue core and the power supply, drawing the reader's attention to these crucial elements. - **Additional Accessories and Equipment**: Considering the dangerous settings of Half-Life, the suit might also feature utility belts, straps, holsters, and gear compartments that carry the character’s inventory. Weapons, particularly those that are iconic to the game series like the crowbar or gravity gun, could be adapted in a way that complements the suit's design. Combining red tones with metallic and asbestos elements gives your character a very distinctive appearance that will make them both look formidable and provide ample opportunity for dramatic effects in your manga panels, such as reflecting light during action scenes or showing off the character’s resilience to environmental hazards."},{"instruction":"However, later in the story around Chapter 5, they get a different outfit. It consists of a gray jacket under a white shirt, a black PASGT vest with a flashlight attached to it, dark blue jeans with kneepads and combat boots.","output":"Transitioning to a different outfit can signify character development, a change in role, or a shift in the story's environment or tone. For your character's new attire, you are describing a significantly more casual and perhaps undercover or civilian-aligned look compared to the more militarized original outfit. Here’s an expansion on that description: - **Gray Jacket over White Shirt**: This combination suggests a more relaxed, civilian feel, possibly reflecting a need to blend in or take on a less combative role temporarily. The jacket can be drawn with stylish folds and shading to give it a comfortable yet durable appearance in the manga style. The white shirt underneath adds a layer of contrast, making the character appear less formidable and more approachable. - **PASGT Vest**: The Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) vest is a classic piece of military equipment. A black vest would serve as a reminder of the character's readiness for combat situations despite the more civilian outerwear. A flashlight attached to the vest underscores a practical and tactical mindset; it could be drawn with attention to detail, giving it a realistic military look. - **Dark Blue Jeans with Kneepads**: The choice of jeans implies a return to a 'normal' life or perhaps a disguise. The jeans paired with kneepads suggest that the character still anticipates action and the potential need for protection and mobility. These can be depicted with rugged seams and a bit of wear and tear to convey a lived-in, functional feel. - **Combat Boots**: Consistent with their original utilitarian outfit, combat boots would tie back to the character's military or combatant background, adding a sturdy foundation to the character's appearance. These can be rendered with heavy treads and reinforced design features, emphasizing their practical use. When making this transition in outfits within your manga: - Maintain some continuity in design elements or colors to keep a visual link to your character’s previous suit. For example, the color of the boots might echo the red of the previous suit, or you may want to retain a motif or accessory that carries through from the earlier chapters. - Use this outfit change as an opportunity to convey your character's mindset or circumstances in this part of the story. Is this a disguise, a forced change due to loss of equipment, or a voluntary adaptation to new challenges? - Illustrate your character interacting with their new attire. Can they move as effectively? Do they miss the advanced capabilities of their previous suit, or do they appreciate the return to something simpler? - Reflect the transition with changes in posture, body language, or even the character's expression to show how they feel about the change. Manga excels at conveying emotion and thought through these visual cues. The change of outfit is a great way to explore and express character progression, and your detailed descriptions provide a solid basis for visual storytelling in your manga."},{"instruction":"Anyway, the main character is a young man named Aaron Park. He has short brown hair and green eyes. He is a bit mute but does sometimes talk with some people and sometimes even screams when being shot at. We do get to hear his thoughts and his past is unknown. As one character went about him, \\"Man of few words aren't you?\\"","output":"Aaron Park sounds like a compelling protagonist, with qualities that will intrigue readers and draw them into both the story and the mysteries surrounding his past. Here is how you might reflect these qualities in your manga: - **Short Brown Hair:** Aaron's hairstyle can be simple but with a distinctive flair that makes him immediately recognizable. In manga, even subtle hair details can be expressive and contribute to a character's mood. You might want shorter strands sticking out to show dishevelment or distress in certain scenarios, or have his hair maintain a consistent shape to suggest a focused and straightforward personality. - **Green Eyes:** Green is often associated with growth, life, and sometimes mystery. Aaron's green eyes can be a window to his soul; even if he does not speak much, his emotions can be intensely conveyed through his eyes. You can illustrate his eyes with extra emphasis in key panels where his inner thoughts or feelings are particularly important. - **Selective Muteness:** This characteristic could be reflected in his body language. Since he's a man of few words, much of his communication will be non-verbal. Manga-style expressions and posture can do a lot of heavy lifting in portraying how he interacts with others and his environment. His occasional screams could be stark contrasts to his usual silence, providing dramatic moments that underline the severity of certain situations. - **Inner Thoughts:** Manga often uses thought bubbles or narration boxes to share a character's inner monologue with the reader. You can use these tools to shed light on Aaron's personality and his perspective on the unfolding events, supplementing his silence in the scenes. His thoughts may also carry hints or subtle clues about his unknown past, teasing readers and maintaining an aura of mystery. - **Mysterious Past:** The enigma of Aaron's history is an engaging element that might unfold gradually. Visual flashbacks, dream sequences, or fragmented images can tease out his backstory without fully revealing it, keeping the audience guessing. Pay attention to how these revelations affect the current narrative and Aaron's development as a character. - **Tagline:** The phrase, \\"Man of few words, aren't you?\\" can be a recurring motif in the manga, emphasizing Aaron's nature and perhaps even becoming a catchphrase that other characters associate with him. This line could be delivered with different emotions depending on who says it, from curiosity to frustration to admiration. Remember that the visual storytelling of manga gives you the freedom to use artistic techniques to reveal the rich inner world of a character who doesn't rely heavily on spoken words. Play with panel layouts, close-up shots, character positioning, and Aaron's interactions with the environment to bring out his persona and keep your readers engaged with his journey throughout the Half-Life 2 inspired world."},{"instruction":"The main antagonist of the manga is a alien species who enslaved earth in 6 years. They're like a combination of the Angels from NGE and the combine from Half Life 2. They have both human and alien forces in their army. They are named the Dimensional Union.","output":"The main antagonist you've described, the Dimensional Union, combining elements of the Angels from \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" (NGE) and the Combine from Half-Life 2, suggests a formidable and complex foe. Here are some ideas on how to depict them in your manga: - **Otherworldly Appearance**: Drawing from the surreal and enigmatic design of the Angels, the Dimensional Union could have a diverse array of forms and sizes within their species. Some might be colossal and bizarre, invoking a sense of awe and fear, while others could be more human-sized but equally alien. They can feature bio-mechanical designs, blending organic shapes with harsh, metal structures, suggesting advanced technology integrated into living organisms. - **Psycho-Environmental Effects**: Like the Angels, their mere presence could have psychological or environmental effects on the humans nearby. Showing these effects in the artwork can create a sense of dread and the supernatural—for example, weather changes, gravity distortions, or unsettling hallucinations experienced by characters when a Union entity is near. - **Twisted Human and Alien Forces**: As part of their army, the Union uses both enslaved humans and aliens. Human forces could be outfitted with cybernetic enhancements or mind-control devices, appearing both familiar and tragically altered. Alien forces could combine elements of the creatures from the Half-Life universe, such as headcrabs or synths, twisted into new forms to serve the Union's needs. - **Symbolism and Insignia**: Give the Dimensional Union a unique symbol or insignia that identifies their presence, similar to how the Combine has its emblem. This symbol could appear on architecture, flags, uniforms, or even the bodies of their troops, tying the Union's forces visually together and making it clear when they influence an area or character. - **Imposing Architecture**: Reflecting the Combine's tendency to reshape Earth's landscapes with imposing and oppressive structures, the Union's constructions could tower over human cities, presenting a blend of alien aesthetics and brutalist design. Where the Combine architecture in Half-Life 2 feels industrial, the Union's might add surreal, unsettling shapes akin to the Angels' abstract forms, emphasizing their otherness. - **Communication**: For the Union's leaders or envoys, you might adopt a unique method of communication that sets them apart, such as psychic links, eerie sounds, or indecipherable languages coupled with translations for the reader in text boxes or subtitles. This will highlight the vast gulf between humans and their conquering foes. - **Visual Storytelling**: Use visual storytelling to emphasize the Union's oppression and the fear they instill. This could include panels showing the contrast between a downtrodden, enslaved population and the immense, unfeeling forces of the Union. As the main antagonist, the Dimensional Union not only serves as a narrative foil to Aaron Park and the human resistance but also allows you to showcase a variety of powerful visual themes and elements in your manga. Through your unique amalgamation of inspirations from NGE and Half-Life 2, you can create a truly daunting and memorable adversary for your story."},{"instruction":"Those aliens are from a manga that I wrote... They were from a manga about the same alien species invading Earth in 1993 and failing around the year of 1995 and officially being defeated around the early 2000s. So... This manga serves as a \\"What if?\\" this alien species managed to win the war against humanity.","output":"Building on the established lore of your earlier manga, you have a unique opportunity to delve deeply into the \\"what if?\\" scenario for this new project. Here's how you can present the Dimensional Union's victory and its ramifications: **Alternate Universe**: Establish early on that this manga explores an alternate timeline where the Dimensional Union succeeds in conquering Earth. This can be done through exposition, a prologue, or a narrative by a character who realizes they're living in an altered reality. **Consequences of Victory**: Illustrate through your manga the global impact of the Union's victory over humanity. Visually depict changed landscapes, transformed cities, and a new world order. Perhaps show familiar landmarks now alien and foreboding, dominated by the Union's architecture and presence. **Moral and Ethical Dilemmas**: With humanity defeated, explore the dire choices and compromises people must make under Union rule. There could be human collaborators who believe alignment with the aliens is the only way to survive, while others might cling to the hope of a second resistance. **Cultural Erosion**: Show the erosion of human culture and civilization under alien dominance. This could be reflected in characters who struggle to remember or cling to remnants of the past, possibly holding onto artifacts or practicing forbidden customs. **The Resistance**: If a resistance exists in this dystopian world, it may be more underground and desperate than ever. Aaron Park might be one of its key figures, bringing hope to a seemingly hopeless situation. Show the various ways in which the resistance operates—sabotage, guerrilla warfare, and hidden communication networks. **Evolution of the Dimensional Union**: Since the time of your original manga, the Union itself may have evolved or changed tactics. Perhaps their initial failure taught them how to better subjugate and control human populations. Show this evolution visually and through plot development. **Adaptation and Determination**: Portray how humans have adapted to this new world. Aside from grim realities, also show resilience and ingenuity—people making the best of a bad situation, displaying determination and hope even in small ways. **Link with Previous Manga**: Introduce callbacks to the original manga with Easter eggs, flashbacks, or characters with knowledge of both timelines. This can create a rich, interconnected universe that rewards readers familiar with your earlier work. Remember, a \\"what if?\\" scenario is fertile ground for exploring themes like destiny, resistance, strength, and adaptation. The darker reality where the Union is victorious gives you a chance to show the flip side of your earlier story's coin, dealing with loss, the struggle to regain freedom, and the enduring human spirit."},{"instruction":"This manga's setting is somewhere in the United Kingdom, with the story's beginning taking place in a dystopic London, now known as, \\"City 34\\" and the areas such as the wasteland and Highway 15 being somewhere around the Strait of Dover. Also, that ghost town in Chapter VI, it looks sort of similar to Cambridge.","output":"Setting your manga's dystopian narrative in a reimagined United Kingdom offers a rich backdrop full of iconic locations that can be twisted into something recognizably eerie and oppressive under the rule of the Dimensional Union. Here's how you might weave these elements into your story: **City 34 (Dystopian London)**: Take London's famous landmarks and streets and reimagine them under alien occupation. The once-bustling city could be depicted with a stark, totalitarian aesthetic. Iconic structures like the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye, and the Tower Bridge could be repurposed or in ruins, symbolizing the Union's dominance over human history and achievements. The busy streets are now patrolled by Union enforcers, and citizens move about with a sense of fear and subjugation. **Wasteland and Highway 15 (Strait of Dover)**: The areas near the Strait of Dover, known for its white cliffs and the channel crossing, could become desolate zones rife with alien flora or fauna that have been introduced into the ecosystem. Highway 15 could be a perilous route used by resistance fighters or civilians attempting to escape the Union's control. It may be fraught with checkpoints, ambushes, and remains of battles old and new. **Cambridge-Like Ghost Town**: Presenting a town similar to Cambridge, known for its university and historical buildings, as a ghost town would be particularly poignant. The silence and emptiness of an area once brimming with academic life and youthful energy could be a powerful image. The university could serve as a hideout, a meeting point for the protagonists, or even a battlefield scarred by conflict. In weaving these real-world locations into your manga, consider the following techniques to bring your setting to life: - **Detailed Art and Aesthetic**: Use detailed architectural drawings to capture the essence of these locations. Then, with careful alterations, show how they've been changed by the occupying forces. Emphasize a mix of destruction and eerie technological imposition over once-familiar sights. - **Atmosphere and Mood**: Create a pervasive atmosphere of oppression and desolation. Use heavy shading, stark contrasts, and oppressive imagery to evoke a sense of loss and the weight of the Union's presence. - **Cultural References**: Include subtle nods to British culture but twisted or repurposed. A Union propaganda poster might, for instance, parody a famous British wartime slogan. - **Maps and Geographic Changes**: Introduce modified maps that highlight the new political geography under the Union. Point out key locations like \\"City 34\\" and how travel and communication between these locations have changed. - **Character Interactions with the Environment**: Show how the characters navigate this altered landscape. For example, they might tread carefully past surveillance drones or use a familiar landmark as a covert meeting point. Your decision to base the story in the UK, combined with the creative reimagining of its sights under alien occupation, adds a layer of authenticity and relatability for readers, while also offering a fresh lens through which to view the familiar dystopian trope. This setting provides a rich tapestry for Aaron Park and other characters to navigate as they face the challenges posed by the Dimensional Union and struggle to reclaim their world."},{"instruction":"The order of the areas when Aaron arrives in City 34 in the beginning are, the train station, central part of the town, construction site, industrial part of the town, arcade, various shops, a soup kitchen and even a laundromat and finally, Clark's lab, a scientist based off of Kleiner from HL2.","output":"Aaron Park’s journey through City 34 brings him through various locales, each with the potential to highlight different aspects of life under the Dimensional Union's rule and to show the state of the human condition in this dystopian UK. Here's how you might structure the development and presentation of these environments in your manga: **Train Station Arrival**: The story could open with Aaron's arrival at the train station, which sets the tone for the occupation. The station could be heavily monitored with security checkpoints, scanners, and propaganda—imposing a sense of control and surveillance right from the outset. **Central Part of Town**: As Aaron moves through the central part of the town, you can depict the everyday life of the occupied populace. This area might show a stark contrast between the civilians and Union forces, highlighting the new social dynamics and the palpable tension in public spaces. **Construction Site**: The construction site could symbolize the ongoing transformation of the city. It may show the Union's infrastructure being built, with humans laboring alongside or under the supervision of alien tech or overseers. This site can demonstrate the blend of human and alien architectural styles, depicting the erasure of historical identity. **Industrial Part of the Town**: This district allows you to explore the Union's exploitation of Earth's resources. The heavy machinery, pollution, and possibly enslaved workers can reflect the grim reality of life and work under the invaders’ grip. **Arcade**: An abandoned or repurposed arcade might serve as a makeshift hub for the resistance or a place for weary citizens to find brief respite. The stark difference between the arcade's intended use and its current state could be a poignant reminder of lost youth and freedom. **Various Shops**: These could reflect the adaptation of human businesses to the new regime—either as fronts for resistance activities or as struggling enterprises, under tight restrictions, that cater to the basic needs of City 34's denizens. **Soup Kitchen and Laundromat**: These public amenities can humanize the setting by showing how ordinary needs persist amidst dystopia. The soup kitchen could be a gathering place for the downtrodden, while the laundromat serves as a façade for covert meetings or exchanges of information. **Clark's Lab**: Finally, Aaron reaches a place of relative safety and potential allyship. Modeling the lab after Dr. Kleiner's from Half-Life 2, it can be filled with improvised gadgets, hidden tech, and a sense of chaotic genius. This is where the resistance's plan can unfold, and alliances are strengthened. As Aaron moves through these areas, your manga can showcase the transformative journey in both physical and emotional terms. Use panel structure and pacing to reflect the transitions between locations, each with their own ambiance and tension. Employ a mix of wide shots to capture the environment and close-ups to hone in on character reactions and interactions. Through this journey, Aaron—and thus the readers—encounter a cross-section of humanity's new reality. It's an opportunity to weave narrative threads, introduce other characters (both friend and foe), and lay the groundwork for Aaron's story arc within the oppressive world of City 34."},{"instruction":"The arcade has 3 floors and that's where Aaron meets another character, Liam who is working undercover for the resistance, tells Aaron that he has to go to the sewers in order to get to Clark's lab. Also, the arcade games are very... Commodore 64-like to say. One of them is about tanks, other a pac-man clone etc. etc. etc. There are some more... advanced arcade games where they are more... VR-like and there's a waiting line at them.","output":"The arcade setting provides an excellent opportunity for world-building and character development, blending the nostalgia of classic gaming with the intrigue of resistance activities. **Arcade Description**: In your manga, the arcade may serve as a juxtaposition of past leisure and current strife. It's an establishment that harks back to simpler times now occupied by a range of starkly different games and serving as a cover for covert activities. The presence of Commodore 64-like games provides a stark contrast with the advanced VR-like games, suggesting perhaps a limitation on technology imposed by the Dimensional Union or a retro theme maintained to keep a low profile. **Visual Style**: You can imbue the arcade with a vivid sense of retro-tech charm. Older arcade machines with blocky graphics and simple sounds could bring readers a wave of nostalgia, and the visuals for these games could be presented in a style reminiscent of pixel art, contrasting with the grim dystopian backdrop. For the VR-like games, a more futuristic look with sleek designs and glowing interfaces would set them apart from the rest, possibly indicating Union technology or contraband entertainment. **Meeting with Liam**: When Aaron meets Liam, the setting can transition from the colorful arcade background to a more shadowy and secretive atmosphere. The character interaction can involve a mix of spoken dialogue and visual cues, hinting at their hidden intentions. Manga is particularly effective at using facial expressions and body language to express unspoken understanding and alliances. **Journey to the Sewers**: Liam's guidance to take the sewers to reach Clark's lab introduces an element of urgency and stealth. This passage could be shown as dark and foreboding, with tight paneling to increase the feeling of claustrophobia and danger. This transition from the arcade to the sewers can also reflect a movement from one form of subterfuge (hiding in plain sight) to another (moving through hidden paths). **VR Games and Waiting Line**: The advanced VR games with a waiting line might indicate either a rare form of escapism that is tightly controlled or monitored by the Union, or perhaps a privilege granted to those who serve or collaborate with the occupiers. This distinction provides a look at the disparity within the occupied society. How people interact with and around these games can say a lot about the world you've created—whether there's apathy, desperation, or controlled resistance. **Illustrative Challenges**: Illustrating this scene provides the opportunity to contrast light and dark themes, peace and conflict, and the visible versus the hidden. Detailed artwork can bring the arcade machines to life, with attention paid to the game screens, the body language of the gamers, and the overall atmosphere of subtle rebellion. The Union's presence can be ever-looming, perhaps with propaganda posters on the walls or surveillance devices in corners. This sequence in your manga not only gives you the chance to introduce important characters and show a unique slice of life under the Union but also serves as a narrative device that propels the story forward, leading Aaron—and the reader—deeper into the resistance movement against the Dimensional Union."},{"instruction":"Also, Liam who originally in the manga where humanity won, he had brown hair but now he has blonde hair. He is sort of similar to Barney from Half Life 2 but in the original manga he was a lot more like Adrian Shephard since in the original story where humanity won he was in the US army...","output":"Liam's character redesign from brown-haired Adrian Shephard-type soldier to a blonde-haired individual resembling Barney from Half-Life 2 allows you to play with themes of identity and adaptation to circumstances. Here are some ways to incorporate this change into your narrative and visuals: **Character Redesign**: In crafting an alternate reality where the Dimensional Union prevails, Liam's change in appearance could be symbolic of the major shifts in his life due to the drastically different outcome of the alien invasion. For example, the change from brown to blonde hair could be an intentional effort to blend into his new environment or disguise his identity for undercover work within the resistance, much like Barney Calhoun's double life as a security officer and resistance member in Half-Life 2. **Personality Developments**: With his background now different, Liam's personality could have evolved. He might have adopted aspects of Barney's more light-hearted or amiable demeanor as a coping mechanism in a grim world or as a facade for his undercover work. Alternatively, his military past, reminiscent of Adrian Shephard, could still come through in his tactical thinking or combat skills, influencing his actions and decisions within the resistance. **Visual Storytelling**: Use visual cues in your manga to underline Liam's dual nature. When in public or interacting with Union forces, he might display a certain demeanor, while in private or with trusted allies, his true self as a seasoned ex-soldier is evident. Flashbacks or visual contrasts between his past and present could further illuminate his character's depth and his journey from soldier to resistance fighter. **Interaction with Aaron**: Liam’s past might make him particularly capable as a mentor or ally to Aaron. His experience as a soldier could prove invaluable in teaching or guiding Aaron through covert operations or simply navigating the hazards of City 34. Their relationship can be a driving force in the manga, with Liam introducing Aaron to key figures in the resistance or assisting him in other significant ways. **Adapting to the New World**: Highlight how Liam's expertise as a soldier has been adapted to meet the changing needs of the resistance. This could be reflected in the way he strategically moves through areas, the decisions he makes, or how he responds to certain challenges they face. In portraying Liam's character transition from the original manga to this alternate reality, you are broadening the narrative scope and deepening his persona. Readers who are familiar with Liam from your previous work will appreciate the changes in his character as a reflection of the new world order. For new readers, his complex background will enrich the story, making him a dynamic and relatable figure within the resistance against the Dimensional Union's occupation."},{"instruction":"Also, in a piece of concept art, Liam would have originally worked at a soup kitchen in City 34 as a frycook. He would have worn a M81 woodland jacket under a white apron and a cook hat or hair net or a rambo-style bandana.","output":"The concept art for Liam working at a soup kitchen adds layers to his character, suggesting a backstory of blending into civilian life to cover his affiliation with the resistance. Here’s how this detail could enrich his portrayal and contribute to the manga's setting: **M81 Woodland Jacket**: The military-themed jacket could signal to the reader Liam’s past connections to the armed forces, hinting at his combat experience and tactical knowledge. The M81 woodland pattern is a recognizable camouflage design and could be used subtly under the apron as a visual cue of his military background. **White Apron**: A white apron is symbolic of service and the everyday worker. It reflects Liam's disguise as a frycook and his attempt to maintain a low profile among the citizens of City 34. This ordinary garment can be an excellent contrast to his hidden identity as a resistance member, playing on the theme of appearances versus reality. **Headwear Choices**: The cook hat or hair net would align with his frycook cover, suggesting a sense of conformity and blending in with the crowd. On the other hand, a bandana could be a nod to a ‘rebel’ image or could be an item Liam uses to switch between his civilian and resistance identities swiftly. If you choose to go with a bandana, especially one styled similarly to Rambo, it might also convey his readiness for combat and action, even while performing the most mundane tasks. **Concept Art Utilization**: Use the concept art as a visual exposition device, either within the manga's narrative as a flashback or as supplemental material for readers. It could serve as a window into Liam's life before meeting Aaron, and also give readers insights into how the resistance embeds itself within the occupied community's fabric for survival and subterfuge. **Interplay with Environment**: In the manga itself, you could have a scene where he works at the soup kitchen, moving deftly between cooking and discreetly passing information or supplies to fellow resistance members. It's an opportunity to show his resourcefulness and the risks he takes to support the cause. In terms of illustrating Liam's character, having a detailed design for his clothing will help convey his role in City 34. The juxtaposition of his cooking attire with the underlying military jacket, the choice of headwear, and his day-to-day interactions in the soup kitchen provide rich visual and narrative depth. These elements can be employed to illustrate the dual nature of Liam’s life—the seemingly ordinary existence masking the extraordinary role of a resistance fighter working against the oppressive Dimensional Union."},{"instruction":"Ok, time to talk about Dr. Clark. Dr. Clark is based off of Kleiner from Half Life 2. He has gray receding hair and Horn-rimmed glasses. In a old picture in his lab there is a picture of him and Aaron when he was 17. Dr. Clark used to be his high school teacher.","output":"Dr. Clark's character draws inspiration from the beloved Dr. Kleiner of the Half-Life series, offering a strong connection point for fans and adding a layer of intellectual depth to your manga's resistance movement. Here's how to integrate Dr. Clark into your story: **Appearance**: The gray receding hair and horn-rimmed glasses lend Dr. Clark a scholarly look that immediately identifies him as an intellectual and a scientist. In manga, character designs often use visual shorthand to communicate a character's archetype to the reader. Clark's appearance can be both endearing and indicative of wisdom and experience. **Connection to Aaron**: Their history, with Clark once being Aaron's high school teacher, grounds their relationship in a pre-invasion world, creating a sense of continuity and hinting at a mentor-mentee dynamic that could play out in various ways. This backstory can be expanded upon through their interactions, dialogues, and possibly shared knowledge or codes that they uniquely understand because of their shared past. **Old Picture**: An old picture showing a younger Clark with a teenaged Aaron can serve as a powerful visual storytelling tool. Not only does it provide a glimpse into their past and the world before its fall, but it also humanizes both characters. It reinforces Clark's role as a mentor and can be a source of motivation for Aaron, reminding him of what he's fighting for and the life he once had. **Characterization in the Lab**: Dr. Clark's lab is an extension of his personality, likely cluttered with experiments, gadgets, and books. His eccentric nature, typical of a scientist deeply involved in his work, can shine through in the organized chaos of his workspace. Gadgets that may serve as Chekhov's guns for later plot points, secret projects meant to counter the Dimensional Union's technology, or simply quirky inventions that reflect his personality—all of these can add color to his lab and to the story itself. **Impact on the Story**: As an inspired figure from Kleiner, Dr. Clark likely plays a crucial role in supplying the resistance with technology, knowledge, or strategic advice. His interactions with Aaron and other characters can be laced with technical jargon, endearing forgetfulness, or urgent genius, depending on the needs of the scene. **Artistic Approach**: In terms of artistic representation, Dr. Clark's expressions can be a mix of distracted contemplation and sharp intelligence. Panels focusing on his glasses catching the light as he comes to a realization or his hands hurriedly assembling components can be used to build tension and emphasize his skills. Dr. Clark's presence in your manga provides emotional depth and a bridge between the past and present struggle against the Dimensional Union. His familiarity and close relationship with Aaron add weight to the resistance's fight and offer readers an anchor point in humanity's quest for liberation in your Half-Life 2-inspired world."},{"instruction":"His lab is a bit messy but at the same time tidy when it comes to the area where he has his teleporter which is giant, white and orb-shaped. The entrance to his lab is via a old soda vending machine with the advertisment of a pre-war soda called \\"POP-DOG\\" with the mascot being a white Dalmatian barking.","output":"Dr. Clark’s lab, with its balance of messiness and order, reflects the mind of a scientist focused on grand pursuits like teleportation while still rooted in everyday practicality. The unique features and the secret entrance add a layer of intrigue and inventive charm to the setting of your manga. Here’s how to incorporate these elements: **The Lab's Duality**: Playing up the contrast within the lab's aesthetics serves to visually distinguish between Clark's general inventiveness and the significance he places on the teleporter. The rest of the lab can be cluttered with papers, tools, and various apparatuses reflecting ongoing work and a fertile mind, while the teleporter area is meticulously organized, emphasizing its importance and the care with which Clark approaches this game-changing technology. **Teleporter Design**: The teleporter itself, described as a giant, white, orb-shaped device, can be a visual centerpiece in the lab. Its pristine condition could stand out against the lab's otherwise chaotic background. This juxtaposition not only underscores the teleporter's significance but can also serve as a metaphor for hope and scientific achievement amidst the disarray of an occupied world. **Secret Lab Entrance**: The old soda vending machine providing access to the lab is quintessential of hidden bases in storytelling and can offer a lighthearted moment in an otherwise tense narrative. The \\"POP-DOG\\" advertisement and Dalmatian mascot can be a throwback to the pre-war era, a touch of nostalgia and perhaps a comment on commercialism turned into a facade for rebellion. When illustrating this, you could have fun with the design, making it vibrant and incongruous with the rest of the setting to highlight its function as a clever disguise. **Artistic Approach**: As Dr. Clark and Aaron (or other characters) engage with these elements, use paneling to steer the reader's focus. For example, the transition from the lab's entrance through the vending machine to the inner sanctum of the teleporter can be an opportunity for a visual storytelling beat. In the manga, play with perspectives: a wide shot to reveal the impressive teleporter creates a sense of awe, while close-ups on details can show the care Dr. Clark puts into his work. **Lab Day-to-Day**: Throughout the lab, you might include papers with scribbles of theories, old photographs or newspaper clippings pinned to walls, and half-completed side projects—a collage of the pre-invasion world intermingling with the current reality of the resistance's struggle. The messiness might reveal an orderly system known only to Dr. Clark, with each pile of paper or component serving a purpose that he understands innately. Incorporating these details effectively in the manga will not only characterize Dr. Clark as a brilliant, if somewhat eccentric, scientist but it will also deepen the readers’ immersion in the world you’re creating. The secret entrance via the vending machine and the sanctity of the teleporter space adds layers to the resistance's operation, while nods to the past humanize the struggle against the Dimensional Union and offer a glimpse of what was lost in the conquest."},{"instruction":"the sides of a triangle are equal in length and the angles are equal in measure what is the measure of each angle","output":"If the sides of a triangle are equal in length and the angles are equal in measure, then the triangle is an equilateral triangle.

This class is quite extensive and appears to represent the player character's status and interactions in a game, including health, stamina, ammunition, and interaction with other game objects like enemies and items. The script includes a combination of game mechanics such as shooting, taking damage, flashlight management, inventory handling, crouching, reloading, and interacting with other objects (e.g., zombies, traps). It also includes sound management, user interface (UI) updates, and visual effects to indicate player status (e.g., blood effects, tentacle animations). Specific implementations for player-selected characters (presumably based on predefined player types or classes) set different initial values for health, ammo, damage, and other stats. The script also involves animations through the Unity Animator, input management, and camera control. It uses the Unity Input System as well as direct key checks for various actions (e.g., Q to set a trap). The \`PlayerVitals\` class implements the \`IDataPersistence\` interface, which suggests it's part of a system that saves and loads persistent data (e.g., between game sessions). It should be noted that the script also seems to depend on various third-party tools and custom components (\`ootii\`, \`AIBehavior\`, \`BreadcrumbAi\`, \`BeautifyEffect\`, \`FIMSpace.FLook\`, \`CameraFilterPack_AAA_BloodOnScreen\`, and others).

This technique is known as Avatar Masking or just Animation Layer Masking. The following steps outline how you can achieve this: 1. Create an Avatar Mask: - In the Unity Project window, right-click and choose \`Create > Avatar Mask\`. - Select the newly created Avatar Mask. - In the Inspector window, you will see a humanoid skeleton representation. Check the body parts you want to include in the masking (for upper body animations, usually the spine and arm bones). 2. Configure Animation Layers: - Select the Animator Controller attached to your character. - In the Animator window, add a new layer by clicking the '+' sign. - Name the new layer something like \\"UpperBodyLayer\\". - Set the 'Blending' mode to 'Override' or 'Additive', depending on how you want the animations to blend. - Adjust the 'Weight' to control how much this layer affects the overall animation. - Assign the Avatar Mask you created to this layer by dragging it into the 'Mask' field in the layer settings. 3. Add State(s) and Animation(s) to the Layer: - In the Animator window, on the newly created layer, create states for the animations you want to play (e.g., idle with shotgun, walk with shotgun, shoot). - Drag the desired animations into the corresponding states. - Connect these states with transitions to define when each animation should play. 4. Control the Layer through Script: - In your character control script, where you manage the character's actions, you'll need to set a parameter (usually a Bool) in the Animator to control whether the character is holding a shotgun. - For example: \`\`\`csharp // Get a reference to the Animator component Animator animator = GetComponent<Animator>(); // Set the parameter to true when the character picks up the shotgun animator.SetBool(\\"IsHoldingShotgun\\", true); // Set it to false when the character is no longer holding the shotgun animator.SetBool(\\"IsHoldingShotgun\\", false); \`\`\` 5. Set up Animator Transitions: - In the Animator window, set up transitions between the states based on the parameters you have defined. - Make sure to have a condition for when the character picks up and puts down the shotgun, affecting the transitions within the upper body layer. 6. Test the Setup: - Enter Play mode in Unity and test your setup by triggering the parameter changes (e.g., pick up a shotgun) and observe the character's animation. This setup allows you to have a base layer that controls the full body animation (e.g., running, jumping) and an additional upper body layer that can override or add to those animations to perform actions like holding or shooting a shotgun."},{"instruction":"my character upper animation leans back when my character walks","output":"If your character's upper body leans back when walking with a shotgun, it's likely because the animations for walking and holding the shotgun are blending together in a way that produces an undesired effect. Here's how you can troubleshoot and fix this issue: 1. **Check the Walk and Shotgun Holding Animations**: Verify that the individual animations for walking and holding the shotgun look correct when played on their own. Ensure that there are no unintended motions such as leaning back. 2. **Review Animation Layer Settings**: Make sure that your Animation Layers are set up correctly in the Animator Controller. The base layer should generally contain the locomotion animations (like walking) and the upper body layer should contain the shotgun holding animation with an appropriate Avatar Mask that only includes the upper body. 3. **Adjust Blend Weights**: Experiment with the blend weights of the upper body layer. If the weight is too high, it may override too much of the locomotion animation, causing unnatural poses like the lean back. You may find that either the \\"Override\\" or \\"Additive\\" blend mode works better for your specific case. 4. **Inspect Avatar Mask**: Double-check the Avatar Mask for the upper body layer to make sure that you've only selected the bones that should be affected by the shotgun holding animation. Ensure that spine bones are included if they are part of the holding animation. 5. **Modify Animation Curves**: If the leaning back persists and is part of the shotgun holding animation, you may need to adjust the animation curves. Use Unity's Animation window to modify keyframes or the overall curve for the spine or upper body bones to keep a more neutral posture. 6. **Use IK (Inverse Kinematics)**: If you use IK (Inverse Kinematics), ensure that the IK targets for the hands holding the shotgun are not causing the character to lean back. You might need to adjust the positions of the IK targets at runtime or within the animation itself to align the character's spine better. 7. **Adjust Runtime Animation Code**: If you modify the character's pose in the script while walking with the shotgun, make sure that any code manipulating the rotation or position of bones (like the spine) is not causing the issue. 8. **Prevent Undesired Rotation Blending**: Make sure that rotations from different animations are not blending together in an undesired way. Sometimes, rotation blending can cause the character model to warp or lean strangely. You can address this by adjusting your animations, using Avatar Masks, and correctly setting up your Animator Controller. 9. **Animator Controller Transitions**: Investigate the transitions in your Animator Controller. Check the settings for the transition conditions between walking and holding the shotgun animations to ensure they are smooth and correct. Adjust the transition offsets and durations as needed. 10. **Testing**: After making adjustments, always test the gameplay to see how the character's animation behaves in different scenarios. This process might involve iterative adjustment and testing to get just right. If these suggestions don't seem to solve the problem, it might help to take a closer look at the animation assets, the specific setup of your Animator Controller, or any custom scripts that are affecting the character's pose."},{"instruction":"Classer les matériaux suivants en fonction de leur capacité à conduire l'électricité : les métaux, les céramiques, les polymères et les composites","output":"Les matériaux peuvent être classés comme suit en fonction de leur capacité à conduire l'électricité : 1.

However, depending on the size of the data, the observed difference in accuracy between two classifiers may not be statistically significant. This section examines some of the statistical tests available to compare the performance of different models and classifiers. For illustrative purposes, consider a pair of classification models, MA and MB. Suppose MA achieves 85% accuracy when evaluated on a test set containing 30 records, while MB achieves 75% accuracy on a different test set containing 5000 records. Based on this information, is MA a better model than MB? 4.6 Methods for Comparing Classifiers 189 The preceding example raises two key questions regarding the statistical significance of the performance metrics: 1. Although MA has a higher accuracy than MB, it was tested on a smaller test set. How much confidence can we place on the accuracy for MA? 2. Is it possible to explain the difference in accuracy as a result of variations in the composition of the test sets? The first question relates to the issue of estimating the confidence interval of a given model accuracy. The second question relates to the issue of testing the statistical significance of the observed deviation. These issues are investigated in the remainder of this section. 4.6.1 Estimating a Confidence Interval for Accuracy To determine the confidence interval, we need to establish the probability distribution that governs the accuracy measure. This section describes an approach for deriving the confidence interval by modeling the classification task as a binomial experiment. Following is a list of characteristics of a binomial experiment: 1. The experiment consists of N independent trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes: success or failure. 2. The probability of success, p, in each trial is constant. An example of a binomial experiment is counting the number of heads that turn up when a coin is flipped N times. If X is the number of successes observed in N trials, then the probability that X takes a particular value is given by a binomial distribution with mean N p and variance N p(1 − p): P(X = v) = N p pv(1 − p) N−v. For example, if the coin is fair (p = 0.5) and is flipped fifty times, then the probability that the head shows up 20 times is P(X = 20) = 50 20 0.520(1 − 0.5)30 = 0.0419. If the experiment is repeated many times, then the average number of heads expected to show up is 50×0.5 = 25, while its variance is 50×0.5×0.5 = 12.5. 190 Chapter 4 Classification The task of predicting the class labels of test records can also be considered as a binomial experiment. Given a test set that contains N records, let X be the number of records correctly predicted by a model and p be the true accuracy of the model. By modeling the prediction task as a binomial experiment, X has a binomial distribution with mean N p and variance N p(1 − p). It can be shown that the empirical accuracy, acc = X/N, also has a binomial distribution with mean p and variance p(1−p)/N (see Exercise 12). Although the binomial distribution can be used to estimate the confidence interval for acc, it is often approximated by a normal distribution when N is sufficiently large. Based on the normal distribution, the following confidence interval for acc can be derived: P − Zα/2 ≤ acc − p p(1 − p)/N ≤ Z1−α/2 = 1 − α, (4.12) where Zα/2 and Z1−α/2 are the upper and lower bounds obtained from a standard normal distribution at confidence level (1 − α). Since a standard normal distribution is symmetric around Z = 0, it follows that Zα/2 = Z1−α/2. Rearranging this inequality leads to the following confidence interval for p: 2 × N × acc + Z2 α/2 ± Zα/2 Z2 α/2 + 4N acc − 4N acc2 2(N + Z2 α/2) . (4.13) The following table shows the values of Zα/2 at different confidence levels: 1 − α 0.99 0.98 0.95 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.5 Zα/2 2.58 2.33 1.96 1.65 1.28 1.04 0.67 Example 4.4. Consider a model that has an accuracy of 80% when evaluated on 100 test records. What is the confidence interval for its true accuracy at a 95% confidence level? The confidence level of 95% corresponds to Zα/2 = 1.96 according to the table given above. Inserting this term into Equation 4.13 yields a confidence interval between 71.1% and 86.7%. The following table shows the confidence interval when the number of records, N, increases: N 20 50 100 500 1000 5000 Confidence 0.584 0.670 0.711 0.763 0.774 0.789 Interval − 0.919 − 0.888 − 0.867 − 0.833 − 0.824 − 0.811 Note that the confidence interval becomes tighter when N increases. 4.6 Methods for Comparing Classifiers 191 4.6.2 Comparing the Performance of Two Models Consider a pair of models, M1 and M2, that are evaluated on two independent test sets, D1 and D2. Let n1 denote the number of records in D1 and n2 denote the number of records in D2. In addition, suppose the error rate for M1 on D1 is e1 and the error rate for M2 on D2 is e2. Our goal is to test whether the observed difference between e1 and e2 is statistically significant. Assuming that n1 and n2 are sufficiently large, the error rates e1 and e2 can be approximated using normal distributions. If the observed difference in the error rate is denoted as d = e1 − e2, then d is also normally distributed with mean dt, its true difference, and variance, σ2 d. The variance of d can be computed as follows: σ2 d σ 2 d = e1(1 − e1) n1 + e2(1 − e2) n2 , (4.14) where e1(1 − e1)/n1 and e2(1 − e2)/n2 are the variances of the error rates. Finally, at the (1 − α)% confidence level, it can be shown that the confidence interval for the true difference dt is given by the following equation: dt = d ± zα/2σ d. (4.15) Example 4.5. Consider the problem described at the beginning of this section. Model MA has an error rate of e1 = 0.15 when applied to N1 = 30 test records, while model MB has an error rate of e2 = 0.25 when applied to N2 = 5000 test records. The observed difference in their error rates is d = |0.15 − 0.25| = 0.1. In this example, we are performing a two-sided test to check whether dt = 0 or dt = 0. The estimated variance of the observed difference in error rates can be computed as follows: σ 2 d = 0.15(1 − 0.15) 30 + 0.25(1 − 0.25) 5000 = 0.0043 or σ d = 0.0655. Inserting this value into Equation 4.15, we obtain the following confidence interval for dt at 95% confidence level: dt = 0.1 ± 1.96 × 0.0655 = 0.1 ± 0.128. As the interval spans the value zero, we can conclude that the observed difference is not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. 192 Chapter 4 Classification At what confidence level can we reject the hypothesis that dt = 0? To do this, we need to determine the value of Zα/2 such that the confidence interval for dt does not span the value zero. We can reverse the preceding computation and look for the value Zα/2 such that d>Zα/2σ d. Replacing the values of d and σ d gives Zα/2 < 1.527. This value first occurs when (1 − α) 0.936 (for a two-sided test). The result suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected at confidence level of 93.6% or lower. 4.6.3 Comparing the Performance of Two Classifiers Suppose we want to compare the performance of two classifiers using the k-fold cross-validation approach. Initially, the data set D is divided into k equal-sized partitions. We then apply each classifier to construct a model from k − 1 of the partitions and test it on the remaining partition. This step is repeated k times, each time using a different partition as the test set. Let Mij denote the model induced by classification technique Li during the jth iteration. Note that each pair of models M1j and M2j are tested on the same partition j. Let e1j and e2j be their respective error rates. The difference between their error rates during the jth fold can be written as dj = e1j − e2j . If k is sufficiently large, then dj is normally distributed with mean dcv t , which is the true difference in their error rates, and variance σcv. Unlike the previous approach, the overall variance in the observed differences is estimated using the following formula: σ 2 dcv = k j=1(dj − d)2 k(k − 1) , (4.16) where d is the average difference. For this approach, we need to use a tdistribution to compute the confidence interval for dcv t : dcv t = d ± t(1−α),k−1σ dcv . The coefficient t(1−α),k−1 is obtained from a probability table with two input parameters, its confidence level (1 − α) and the number of degrees of freedom, k − 1. The probability table for the t-distribution is shown in Table 4.6. Example 4.6. Suppose the estimated difference in the accuracy of models generated by two classification techniques has a mean equal to 0.05 and a standard deviation equal to 0.002. If the accuracy is estimated using a 30-fold cross-validation approach, then at a 95% confidence level, the true accuracy difference is dcv t = 0.05 ± 2.04 × 0.002.

For example, the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress classification systems were designed to catalog and index the vast number of library books. The categories are typically identified in a manual fashion, with the help of domain experts. Automated classification has been a subject of intensive research for many years. The study of classification in classical statistics is sometimes known as discriminant analysis, where the objective is to predict the group membership of an object based on a set of predictor variables. A well-known classical method is Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis [117], which seeks to find a linear projection of the data that produces the greatest discrimination between objects that belong to different classes. Many pattern recognition problems also require the discrimination of objects from different classes. Examples include speech recognition, handwritten character identification, and image classification. Readers who are interested in the application of classification techniques for pattern recognition can refer to the survey articles by Jain et al. [122] and Kulkarni et al. [128] or classic pattern recognition books by Bishop [107], Duda et al. [114], and Fukunaga [118]. The subject of classification is also a major research topic in the fields of neural networks, statistical learning, and machine learning. An in-depth treat- 194 Chapter 4 Classification ment of various classification techniques is given in the books by Cherkassky and Mulier [112], Hastie et al. [120], Michie et al. [133], and Mitchell [136]. An overview of decision tree induction algorithms can be found in the survey articles by Buntine [110], Moret [137], Murthy [138], and Safavian et al. [147]. Examples of some well-known decision tree algorithms include CART [108], ID3 [143], C4.5 [145], and CHAID [125]. Both ID3 and C4.5 employ the entropy measure as their splitting function. An in-depth discussion of the C4.5 decision tree algorithm is given by Quinlan [145]. Besides explaining the methodology for decision tree growing and tree pruning, Quinlan [145] also described how the algorithm can be modified to handle data sets with missing values. The CART algorithm was developed by Breiman et al. [108] and uses the Gini index as its splitting function. CHAID [125] uses the statistical χ2 test to determine the best split during the tree-growing process. The decision tree algorithm presented in this chapter assumes that the splitting condition is specified one attribute at a time. An oblique decision tree can use multiple attributes to form the attribute test condition in the internal nodes [121, 152]. Breiman et al. [108] provide an option for using linear combinations of attributes in their CART implementation. Other approaches for inducing oblique decision trees were proposed by Heath et al. [121], Murthy et al. [139], Cant´u-Paz and Kamath [111], and Utgoff and Brodley [152]. Although oblique decision trees help to improve the expressiveness of a decision tree representation, learning the appropriate test condition at each node is computationally challenging. Another way to improve the expressiveness of a decision tree without using oblique decision trees is to apply a method known as constructive induction [132]. This method simplifies the task of learning complex splitting functions by creating compound features from the original attributes. Besides the top-down approach, other strategies for growing a decision tree include the bottom-up approach by Landeweerd et al. [130] and Pattipati and Alexandridis [142], as well as the bidirectional approach by Kim and Landgrebe [126]. Schuermann and Doster [150] and Wang and Suen [154] proposed using a soft splitting criterion to address the data fragmentation problem. In this approach, each record is assigned to different branches of the decision tree with different probabilities. Model overfitting is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure that a decision tree classifier performs equally well on previously unknown records. The model overfitting problem has been investigated by many authors including Breiman et al. [108], Schaffer [148], Mingers [135], and Jensen and Cohen [123]. While the presence of noise is often regarded as one of the Bibliography 195 primary reasons for overfitting [135, 140], Jensen and Cohen [123] argued that overfitting is the result of using incorrect hypothesis tests in a multiple comparison procedure. Schapire [149] defined generalization error as “the probability of misclassifying a new example” and test error as “the fraction of mistakes on a newly sampled test set.” Generalization error can therefore be considered as the expected test error of a classifier. Generalization error may sometimes refer to the true error [136] of a model, i.e., its expected error for randomly drawn data points from the same population distribution where the training set is sampled. These definitions are in fact equivalent if both the training and test sets are gathered from the same population distribution, which is often the case in many data mining and machine learning applications. The Occam’s razor principle is often attributed to the philosopher William of Occam. Domingos [113] cautioned against the pitfall of misinterpreting Occam’s razor as comparing models with similar training errors, instead of generalization errors. A survey on decision tree-pruning methods to avoid overfitting is given by Breslow and Aha [109] and Esposito et al. [116]. Some of the typical pruning methods include reduced error pruning [144], pessimistic error pruning [144], minimum error pruning [141], critical value pruning [134], cost-complexity pruning [108], and error-based pruning [145]. Quinlan and Rivest proposed using the minimum description length principle for decision tree pruning in [146]. Kohavi [127] had performed an extensive empirical study to compare the performance metrics obtained using different estimation methods such as random subsampling, bootstrapping, and k-fold cross-validation. Their results suggest that the best estimation method is based on the ten-fold stratified cross-validation. Efron and Tibshirani [115] provided a theoretical and empirical comparison between cross-validation and a bootstrap method known as the 632+ rule. Current techniques such as C4.5 require that the entire training data set fit into main memory. There has been considerable effort to develop parallel and scalable versions of decision tree induction algorithms. Some of the proposed algorithms include SLIQ by Mehta et al. [131], SPRINT by Shafer et al. [151], CMP by Wang and Zaniolo [153], CLOUDS by Alsabti et al. [106], RainForest by Gehrke et al. [119], and ScalParC by Joshi et al. [124]. A general survey of parallel algorithms for data mining is available in [129]. 196 Chapter 4 Classification Bibliography [106] K. Alsabti, S. Ranka, and V. Singh.

Decision trees for Exercise 9. 4.8 Exercises 203 Compute the total description length of each decision tree according to the minimum description length principle. • The total description length of a tree is given by: Cost(tree, data) = Cost(tree) + Cost(data|tree). • Each internal node of the tree is encoded by the ID of the splitting attribute. If there are m attributes, the cost of encoding each attribute is log2 m bits. • Each leaf is encoded using the ID of the class it is associated with. If there are k classes, the cost of encoding a class is log2 k bits. • Cost(tree) is the cost of encoding all the nodes in the tree. To simplify the computation, you can assume that the total cost of the tree is obtained by adding up the costs of encoding each internal node and each leaf node. • Cost(data|tree) is encoded using the classification errors the tree commits on the training set. Each error is encoded by log2 n bits, where n is the total number of training instances. Which decision tree is better, according to the MDL principle? 10. While the .632 bootstrap approach is useful for obtaining a reliable estimate of model accuracy, it has a known limitation [127]. Consider a two-class problem, where there are equal number of positive and negative examples in the data. Suppose the class labels for the examples are generated randomly. The classifier used is an unpruned decision tree (i.e., a perfect memorizer). Determine the accuracy of the classifier using each of the following methods. (a) The holdout method, where two-thirds of the data are used for training and the remaining one-third are used for testing. (b) Ten-fold cross-validation. (c) The .632 bootstrap method. (d) From the results in parts (a), (b), and (c), which method provides a more reliable evaluation of the classifier’s accuracy? 11. Consider the following approach for testing whether a classifier A beats another classifier B. Let N be the size of a given data set, pA be the accuracy of classifier A, pB be the accuracy of classifier B, and p = (pA + pB)/2 be the average accuracy for both classifiers. To test whether classifier A is significantly better than B, the following Z-statistic is used: Z = pA − pB 2p(1−p) N .

Throughout this lecture we assume a regression setting, i.e. . In this lecture we will decompose the generalization error of a classifier into three rather interpretable terms. Before we do that, let us consider that for any given input there might not exist a unique label . For example, if your vector describes features of house (e.g. #bedrooms, square footage, ...) and the label its price, you could imagine two houses with identical description selling for different prices. So for any given feature vector , there is a distribution over possible labels. We therefore define the following, which will come in useful later on: Expected Label (given ): The expected label denotes the label you would expect to obtain, given a feature vector . Alright, so we draw our training set , consisting of inputs, i.i.d. from the distribution . As a second step we typically call some machine learning algorithm on this data set to learn a hypothesis (aka classifier). Formally, we denote this process as . For a given , learned on data set with algorithm , we can compute the generalization error (as measured in squared loss) as follows: Expected Test Error (given ): Note that one can use other loss functions. We use squared loss because it has nice mathematical properties, and it is also the most common loss function. The previous statement is true for a given training set . However, remember that itself is drawn from , and is therefore a random variable. Further, is a function of , and is therefore also a random variable. And we can of course compute its expectation: Expected Classifier (given ): D = {(x1, y1),…,(xn, yn)} P(X, Y ) y ∈ R x y x y x x ∈ R d y¯(x) = E [Y ] = y Pr(y|x)∂y. y|x ∫ y x D n P A hD = A(D) hD D A hD E [ ] = Pr(x, y)∂y∂x.

We can also use the fact that is a random variable to compute the expected test error only given , taking the expectation also over . Expected Test Error (given ): To be clear, is our training points and the pairs are the test points. We are interested in exactly this expression, because it evaluates the quality of a machine learning algorithm with respect to a data distribution . In the following we will show that this expression decomposes into three meaningful terms. Decomposition of Expected Test Error The middle term of the above equation is as we show below Returning to the earlier expression, we're left with the variance and another term We can break down the second term in the above equation as follows: The third term in the equation above is , as we show below This gives us the decomposition of expected test error as follows Variance: Captures how much your classifier changes if you train on a different training set.

This is due to your classifier being \\"biased\\" to a particular kind of solution (e.g. linear classifier). In other words, bias is inherent to your model. Noise: How big is the data-intrinsic noise? This error measures ambiguity due to your data distribution and feature representation. You can never beat this, it is an aspect of the data. Fig 1: Graphical illustration of bias and variance. Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html Fig 2: The variation of Bias and Variance with the model complexity. This is similar to the concept of overfitting and underfitting. More complex models overfit while the simplest models underfit. Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html Detecting High Bias and High Variance If a classifier is under-performing (e.g. if the test or training error is too high), there are several ways to improve performance. To find out which of these many techniques is the right one for the situation, the first step is to determine the root of the problem. Figure 3: Test and training error as the number of training instances increases. The graph above plots the training error and the test error and can be divided into two overarching regimes. In the first regime (on the left side of the graph), training error is below the desired error threshold (denoted by ), but test error is significantly higher. In the second regime (on the right side of the graph), test error is remarkably close to training error, but both are above the desired tolerance of . Regime 1 (High Variance) In the first regime, the cause of the poor performance is high variance. Symptoms: 1. Training error is much lower than test error 2. Training error is lower than 3. Test error is above Remedies: Add more training data Reduce model complexity -- complex models are prone to high variance Bagging (will be covered later in the course) Regime 2 (High Bias) Unlike the first regime, the second regime indicates high bias: the model being used is not robust enough to produce an accurate prediction. Symptoms: 1. Training error is higher than Remedies: Use more complex model (e.g. kernelize, use non-linear models) Add features Boosting (will be covered later in the course) ϵ ϵ ϵ ϵ ϵ Home Aarshay Jain — Updated On September 15th, 2023 Algorithm Data Science Intermediate Machine Learning Python Regression Statistics Structured Data Supervised Master the Art of Data Science: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming an Industry-Ready Data Scientist Download Roadmap × Last week, I saw a recorded talk at NYC Data Science Academy from Owen Zhang, Chief Product Officer at DataRobot. He said, ‘if you are using regression without regularization, you have to be very special!’. I hope you get what a person of his stature referred to. I understood it very well and decided to explore regularization techniques in detail. In this article, I have explained the complex science behind ‘Ridge Regression‘ and ‘Lasso Regression, ‘ which are the most fundamental regularization techniques used in data science, sadly still not used by many.

Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time. A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials, which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand. Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks — and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors. In this challenge, get a taste of the demand forecasting challenge using a real dataset. Practice Now What Are Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression? When we talk about regression, we often end up discussing Linear and Logistic Regression, as they are the most popular of the 7 types of regressions. In this article, we’ll focus on Ridge and Lasso regression, which are powerful techniques generally used for creating parsimonious models in the presence of a ‘large’ number of features. Here ‘large’ can typically mean either of two things: 1. Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting) 2. Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in the case of millions or billions of features. Though Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. If you’ve heard of them before, you must know that they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features and minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called ‘regularization’ techniques. Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). Regularization Techniques The key difference is in how they assign penalties to the coefficients: 1. Ridge Regression: 1. Performs L2 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of square of coefficients) 2. Lasso Regression: 1. Performs L1 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the absolute value ofthe magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of the absolute value of coefficients) Here, LS Obj refers to the ‘least squares objective,’ i.e., the linear regression objective without regularization. If terms like ‘penalty’ and ‘regularization’ seem very unfamiliar to you, don’t worry; we’ll discuss these in more detail throughout this article. Before digging further into how they work, let’s try to understand why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should work in the first place. Why Penalize the Magnitude of Coefficients? Let’s try to understand the impact of model complexity on the magnitude of coefficients. As an example, I have simulated a sine curve (between 60° and 300°) and added some random noise using the following code: Python Code @shivanshkausha/Ridge_and_Lasso_Regression_jan-28-2016 A Nix repl by shivanshkausha Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 34 SH This resembles a sine curve but not exactly because of the noise. We’ll use this as an example to test different scenarios in this article. Let’s try to estimate the sine function using polynomial regression with powers of x from 1 to 15. Let’s add a column for each power upto 15 in our dataframe. This can be accomplished using the following code: Add a Column for Each Power upto 15 for i in range(2,16): #power of 1 is already there colname = 'x_%d'%i #new var will be x_power data[colname] = data['x']**i print(data.head())add a column for each power upto 15 The dataframe looks like this: Making 15 Different Linear Regression Models Now that we have all the 15 powers, let’s make 15 different linear regression models, with each model containing variables with powers of x from 1 to the particular model number. For example, the feature set of model 8 will be – {x, x_2, x_3, …, x_8}. First, we’ll define a generic function that takes in the required maximum power of x as an input and returns a list containing – [ model RSS, intercept, coef_x, coef_x2, … upto entered power ]. Here RSS refers to the ‘Residual Sum of Squares,’ which is nothing but the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values in the training data set and is known as the cost function or the loss function. The python code defining the function is: #Import Linear Regression model from scikit-learn. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression def linear_regression(data, power, models_to_plot): #initialize predictors: predictors=['x'] if power>=2: predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,power+1)]) #Fit the model linreg = LinearRegression(normalize=True) linreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = linreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered power if power in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[power]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for power: %d'%power) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([linreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(linreg.coef_) return ret Note that this function will not plot the model fit for all the powers but will return the RSS and coefficient values for all the models. I’ll skip the details of the code for now to maintain brevity. I’ll be happy to discuss the same through the comments below if required. Store allthe Results in Pandas Dataframe Now, we can make all 15 models and compare the results. For ease of analysis, we’ll store all the results in a Pandas dataframe and plot 6 models to get an idea of the trend. Consider the following code: #Initialize a dataframe to store the results: col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['model_pow_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] coef_matrix_simple = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the powers for which a plot is required: models_to_plot = {1:231,3:232,6:233,9:234,12:235,15:236} #Iterate through all powers and assimilate results for i in range(1,16): coef_matrix_simple.iloc[i-1,0:i+2] = linear_regression(data, power=i, models_to_plot=models_to_plot) We would expect the models with increasing complexity to better fit the data and result in lower RSS values. This can be verified by looking at the plots generated for 6 models: This clearly aligns with our initial understanding. As the model complexity increases, the models tend to fit even smaller deviations in the training data set. Though this leads to overfitting, let’s keep this issue aside for some time and come to our main objective, i.e., the impact on the magnitude of coefficients. This can be analyzed by looking at the data frame created above. Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_simple The output looks like this: It is clearly evident that the size of coefficients increases exponentially with an increase in model complexity. I hope this gives some intuition into why putting a constraint on the magnitude of coefficients can be a good idea to reduce model complexity. Let’s try to understand this even better. What does a large coefficient signify? It means that we’re putting a lot of emphasis on that feature, i.e., the particular feature is a good predictor for the outcome. When it becomes too large, the algorithm starts modeling intricate relations to estimate the output and ends up overfitting the particular training data. I hope the concept is clear. Now, let’s understand ridge and lasso regression in detail and see how well they work for the same problem. How Does Ridge Regression Work? As mentioned before, ridge regression performs ‘L2 regularization‘, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of squares of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, ridge regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe square of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) is the parameter that balances the amount of emphasis given to minimizing RSS vs minimizing the sum of squares of coefficients. α can take various values: 1. α = 0: 1. The objective becomes the same as simple linear regression. 2. We’ll get the same coefficients as simple linear regression. 2. α = ∞: 1. The coefficients will be zero. Why? Because of infinite weightage on the square of coefficients, anything less than zero will make the objective infinite. 3. 0 < α < ∞: 1. The magnitude of α will decide the weightage given to different parts of the objective. 2. The coefficients will be somewhere between 0 and ones for simple linear regression. I hope this gives some sense of how α would impact the magnitude of coefficients. One thing is for sure – any non-zero value would give values less than that of simple linear regression. By how much? We’ll find out soon. Leaving the mathematical details for later, let’s see ridge regression in action on the same problem as above. Function for Ridge Regression First, let’s define a generic function for ridge regression similar to the one defined for simple linear regression. The Python code is: from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge def ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model ridgereg = Ridge(alpha=alpha,normalize=True) ridgereg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = ridgereg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([ridgereg.intercept_]) ret.extend(ridgereg.coef_) return ret Note the ‘Ridge’ function used here. It takes ‘alpha’ as a parameter on initialization. Also, keep in mind that normalizing the inputs is generally a good idea in every type of regression and should be used in the case of ridge regression as well. Now, let’s analyze the result of Ridge regression for 10 different values of α ranging from 1e-15 to 20. These values have been chosen so that we can easily analyze the trend with changes in values of α. These would, however, differ from case to case. Note that each of these 10 models will contain all the 15 variables, and only the value of alpha would differ. This differs from the simple linear regression case, where each model had a subset of features. Python Code #Initialize predictors to be set of 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Set the different values of alpha to be tested alpha_ridge = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10, 20] #Initialize the dataframe for storing coefficients. col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_ridge[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_ridge = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) models_to_plot = {1e-15:231, 1e-10:232, 1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 5:236} for i in range(10): coef_matrix_ridge.iloc[i,] = ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha_ridge[i], models_to_plot) This would generate the following plot: Here we can clearly observe that as the value of alpha increases, the model complexity reduces. Though higher values of alpha reduce overfitting, significantly high values can cause underfitting as well (e.g., alpha = 5). Thus alpha should be chosen wisely. A widely accepted technique is cross-validation, i.e., the value of alpha is iterated over a range of values, and the one giving a higher cross-validation score is chosen. Let’s have a look at the value of coefficients in the above models: Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_ridge The table looks like: This straight away gives us the following inferences: 1. The RSS increases with an increase in alpha. 2. An alpha value as small as 1e-15 gives us a significant reduction in the magnitude of coefficients. How? Compare the coefficients in the first row of this table to the last row of the simple linear regression table. 3. High alpha values can lead to significant underfitting. Note the rapid increase in RSS for values of alpha greater than 1 4. Though the coefficients are really small, they are NOT zero. The first 3 are very intuitive. But #4 is also a crucial observation. Let’s reconfirm the same by determining the number of zeros in each row of the coefficients data set: Python Code coef_matrix_ridge.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: This confirms that all 15 coefficients are greater than zero in magnitude (can be +ve or -ve). Remember this observation and have a look again until it’s clear. This will play an important role later while comparing ridge with lasso regression. How Does Lasso Regression Work? LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I know it doesn’t give much of an idea, but there are 2 keywords here – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection. ‘ Let’s consider the former first and worry about the latter later. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of the absolute value of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, lasso regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe absolute value of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) works similar to that of the ridge and provides a trade-off between balancing RSS and the magnitude of coefficients. Like that of the ridge, α can take various values. Let’s iterate it here briefly: 1. α = 0: Same coefficients as simple linear regression 2. α = ∞: All coefficients zero (same logic as before) 3. 0 < α < ∞: coefficients between 0 and that of simple linear regression Defining Generic Function Yes, its appearing to be very similar to Ridge till now. But hang on with me, and you’ll know the difference by the time we finish. Like before, let’s run lasso regression on the same problem as above. First, we’ll define a generic function: from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso def lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model lassoreg = Lasso(alpha=alpha,normalize=True, max_iter=1e5) lassoreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = lassoreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([lassoreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(lassoreg.coef_) return ret Notice the additional parameters defined in the Lasso function – ‘max_iter. ‘ This is the maximum number of iterations for which we want the model to run if it doesn’t converge before. This exists for Ridge as well, but setting this to a higher than default value was required in this case. Why?I’ll come to this in the next section. Different Values of Alpha Let’s check the output for 10 different values of alpha using the following code: #Initialize predictors to all 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Define the alpha values to test alpha_lasso = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-5,1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10] #Initialize the dataframe to store coefficients col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_lasso[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_lasso = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the models to plot models_to_plot = {1e-10:231, 1e-5:232,1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 1:236} #Iterate over the 10 alpha values: for i in range(10): coef_matrix_lasso.iloc[i,] = lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha_lasso[i], models_to_plot) This gives us the following plots: This again tells us that the model complexity decreases with an increase in the values of alpha. But notice the straight line at alpha=1. Appears a bit strange to me. Let’s explore this further by looking at the coefficients: Apart from the expected inference of higher RSS for higher alphas, we can see the following: 1. For the same values of alpha, the coefficients of lasso regression are much smaller than that of ridge regression (compare row 1 of the 2 tables). 2. For the same alpha, lasso has higher RSS (poorer fit) as compared to ridge regression. 3. Many of the coefficients are zero, even for very small values of alpha. Inferences #1 and 2 might not always generalize but will hold for many cases. The real difference from the ridge is coming out in the last inference. Let’s check the number of coefficients that are zero in each model using the following code: coef_matrix_lasso.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: We can observe that even for a small value of alpha, a significant number of coefficients are zero. This also explains the horizontal line fit for alpha=1 in the lasso plots; it’s just a baseline model! This phenomenon of most of the coefficients being zero is called ‘sparsity. ‘ Although lasso performs feature selection, this level of sparsity is achieved in special cases only, which we’ll discuss towards the end. This has some really interesting implications on the use cases of lasso regression as compared to that of ridge regression. But before coming to the final comparison, let’s take a bird’s eye view of the mathematics behind why coefficients are zero in the case of lasso but not ridge.

If you wish to get into the details, I recommend taking a good statistics textbook, like Elements of Statistical Learning. Let’s start by reviewing the basic structure of data in a regression problem. In this infographic, you can see there are 4 data elements: 1. X: the matrix of input features (nrow: N, ncol: M+1) 2. Y: the actual outcome variable (length:N) 3. Yhat: these are predicted values of Y (length:N) 4. W: the weights or the coefficients (length: M+1) Here, N is the total number of data points available, and M is the total number of features. X has M+1 columns because of M features and 1 intercept. The predicted outcome for any data point i is: It is simply the weighted sum of each data point with coefficients as the weights. This prediction is achieved by finding the optimum value of weights based on certain criteria, which depends on the type of regression algorithm being used. Let’s consider all 3 cases: Simple Linear Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is just the RSS (Residual Sum of Squares), i.e., the sum of squared errors of the predicted outcome as compared to the actual outcome. This can be depicted mathematically as: In order to minimize this cost, we generally use a ‘gradient descent’ algorithm. The overall algorithm works like this: 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 determine the gradient 2.1.2 update the jth weight by subtracting learning rate times the gradient w(t+1) = w(t) - learning rate * gradient Here the important step is #2.1.1, where we compute the gradient. A gradient is nothing but a partial differential of the cost with respect to a particular weight (denoted as wj). The gradient for the jth weight will be: This is formed from 2 parts: 1. 2*{..}: This is formed because we’ve differentiated the square of the term in {..} 2. -wj: This is the differentiation of the part in {..} wrt wj. Since it’s a summation, all others would become 0, and only wj would remain. Step #2.1.2 involves updating the weights using the gradient. This updating step for simple linear regression looks like this: Note the +ve sign in the RHS is formed after the multiplication of 2 -ve signs. I would like to explain point #2 of the gradient descent algorithm mentioned above, ‘iterate till not converged.‘ Here convergence refers to attaining the optimum solution within the pre-defined limit. It is checked using the value of the gradient. If the gradient is small enough, it means we are very close to the optimum, and further iterations won’t substantially impact the coefficients. The lower limit on the gradient can be changed using the ‘tol‘ parameter. Let’s consider the case of ridge regression now. Ridge Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of squares of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient would be: Again in the regularization part of a gradient, only w remains, and all others would become zero. The corresponding update rule is: j Here we can see that the second part of the RHS is the same as that of simple linear regression. Thus, ridge regression is equivalent to reducing the weight by a factor of (1-2λη) first and then applying the same update rule as simple linear regression. I hope this explains why the coefficients get reduced to small numbers but never become zero. Note that the criteria for convergence, in this case, remains similar to simple linear regression, i.e., checking the value of gradients. Let’s discuss Lasso regression now. Lasso Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of the absolute value of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient is not defined as the absolute function is not differentiable at x=0. This can be illustrated as: We can see that the parts on the left and right sides of 0 are straight lines with defined derivates, but the function can’t be differentiated at x=0. In this case, we have to use a different technique called coordinate descent, which is based on the concept of sub-gradients. One of the coordinate descent follows the following algorithms (this is also the default in sklearn): 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 update the jth weight with a value which minimizes the cost #2.1.1 might look too generalized. But I’m intentionally leaving the details and jumping to the update rule: Difference Between Actual and Predicted Outcome Here g(w-j) represents (but not exactly) the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome considering all EXCEPT the jth variable. If this value is small, it means that the algorithm is able to predict the outcome fairly well even without the jth variable, and thus it can be removed from the equation by setting a zero coefficient. This gives us some intuition into why the coefficients become zero in the case of lasso regression. In coordinate descent, checking convergence is another issue. Since gradients are not defined, we need an alternate method. Many alternatives exist, but the simplest one is to check the step size of the algorithm. We can check the maximum difference in weights in any particular cycle overall feature weights (#2.1 of the algorithm above). If this is lower than the specified ‘tol,’ the algorithm will stop. The convergence is not as fast as the gradient descent. If a warning appears saying that the algorithm stopped before convergence, we might have to set the ‘max_iter’ parameter. This is why I specified this parameter in the Lasso generic function. Let’s summarize our understanding by comparing the coefficients in all the three cases using the following visual, which shows how the ridge and lasso coefficients behave in comparison to the simple linear regression case. Reinforced Facts Apologies for the lack of visual appeal. But I think it is good enough to re-inforced the following facts: 1. The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and thus never attain zero values but very small values. 2. The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge. Before going further, one important issue in the case of both ridge and lasso regression is intercept handling. Generally, regularizing the intercept is not a good idea and should be left out of regularization. This requires slight changes in the implementation, which I’ll leave you to explore. Comparison Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression Now that we have a fair idea of how ridge and lasso regression work, let’s try to consolidate our understanding by comparing them and appreciating their specific use cases. I will also compare them with some alternate approaches. Let’s analyze these under three buckets: Key Difference Ridge: It includes all (or none) of the features in the model. Thus, the major advantage of ridge regression is coefficient shrinkage and reducing model complexity. Lasso: Along with shrinking coefficients, the lasso also performs feature selection. (Remember the ‘selection‘ in the lasso full-form?) As we observed earlier, some of the coefficients become exactly zero, which is equivalent to the particular feature being excluded from the model. Traditionally, techniques like stepwise regression were used to perform feature selection and make parsimonious models. But with advancements in Machine-Learning, ridge and lasso regressions provide very good alternatives as they give much better output, require fewer tuning parameters, and can be automated to a large extent. Typical Use Cases Ridge: It is majorly used to prevent overfitting. Since it includes all the features, it is not very useful in the case of exorbitantly high #features, say in millions, as it will pose computational challenges. Lasso: Since it provides sparse solutions, it is generally the model of choice (or some variant of this concept) for modeling cases where the #features are in millions or more. In such a case, getting a sparse solution is of great computational advantage as the features with zero coefficients can be ignored. It’s not hard to see why the stepwise selection techniques become practically cumbersome to implement in highdimensionality cases. Thus, the lasso provides a significant advantage. Presence of Highly Correlated Features Ridge: It generally works well even in the presence of highly correlated features, as it will include all of them in the model. Still, the coefficients will be distributed among them depending on the correlation. Lasso: It arbitrarily selects any feature among the highly correlated ones and reduces the coefficients of the rest to zero. Also, the chosen variable changes randomly with changes in model parameters. This generally doesn’t work that well as compared to ridge regression. This disadvantage of the lasso can be observed in the example we discussed above. Since we used a polynomial regression, the variables were highly correlated. (Not sure why? Check the output of data.corr() ). Thus, we saw that even small values of alpha were giving significant sparsity (i.e., high #coefficients as zero). Along with Ridge and Lasso, Elastic Net is another useful technique that combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It can be used to balance out the pros and cons of ridge and lasso regression. I encourage you to explore it further. Conclusion In this article, we got an overview of regularization using ridge and lasso regression. We then found out why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should give us parsimonious models. Next, we went into details of ridge and lasso regression and saw their advantages over simple linear regression. We also understood how and why they should work. We also peeked into the mathematical part of the regressions. Regularization techniques are really useful, and I encourage you to implement them. If you’re ready to take the challenge, you must try them on the BigMart Sales Prediction problem discussed at the beginning of this article. Key Takeaways Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In Python, scikit-learn provides easy-to-use functions for implementing Ridge and Lasso regression with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity in the input data by reducing the impact of correlated features on the coefficients, while Lasso regression automatically selects the most important features for prediction. Frequently Asked Questions Q1. Whatis ridge and lasso regression? A. Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques in machine learning. Ridge adds L2 regularization, and Lasso adds L1 to linear regression models, preventing overfitting. Q2. When to use ridge regression and when to use lasso regression? A. Use Ridge when you have many correlated predictors and want to avoid multicollinearity. Use Lasso when feature selection is crucial or when you want a sparse model. 54 thoughts on \\"Ridge and Lasso Regression in Python | Complete Tutorial (Updated 2023)\\" Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury says: January 28, 2016 at 8:26 pm Good read, liked the way you explained why weight constraining is essential for regularization.

These samples offer direct evidence of the planet's geology, composition, and physical properties. Here are a few ways in which Mars samples align with existing research: 1. Composition: Mars samples such as meteorites, as well as the data gathered by rovers and landers, have revealed that the planet has a predominantly basaltic crust. This aligns with research that suggests Mars has a similar composition to Earth's oceanic crust, which is largely composed of basalt. Additionally, the presence of certain minerals like hematite, olivine, and pyroxenes in Martian samples is consistent with findings from remote sensing and other observational techniques. 2. Volcanic activity: Volcanic rocks collected from Mars provide evidence of past volcanic activity. Research on Martian samples indicates that the planet has experienced eruptions in the past, with lava flows and volcanic features resembling those on Earth. These findings align with previous observations from orbiters and rovers, which have identified volcanic landforms and evidence of ancient lava flows on Mars. 3. Water history: Mars samples have provided important clues about the planet's history of water. Analysis of Martian meteorites and studies of rover-collected samples have revealed mineralogical and geochemical signatures indicative of past water-related processes, such as the formation of clay minerals and the presence of hydrated minerals.

Mars is a barren, inhospitable planet with extreme conditions that make it unlikely to support complex life as we know it. However, the concept of diversity can be explored in relation to the scientific study of Mars. The diversity relevant to Mars generally refers to the variety of geological features, landscapes, and geological processes observed on the planet. Mars exhibits a diverse range of landforms, including impact craters, volcanoes, valleys, canyons, sedimentary layers, polar ice caps, and more. These features provide evidence of a dynamic and complex geological history, such as volcanic activity, fluvial processes, wind erosion, and potential past existence of liquid water. Scientists study this diversity to understand the planet's formation, evolution, and potential habitability. It's important to note that any discussions of population or life on Mars, beyond the microbial level, are purely speculative at this point. Future missions and scientific advancements may provide more insight into the potential for any kind of life or diversity on Mars, but currently, our knowledge is limited to the geological diversity of the planet."},{"instruction":"What is the accessibility of the planet Mars?","output":"The accessibility of the planet Mars refers to the feasibility and ease of reaching and exploring Mars for human missions or robotic exploration. Mars is the most accessible planet beyond Earth in our solar system due to several factors: 1. Orbital proximity: Mars is the second nearest planet to Earth after Venus. The distance between Earth and Mars varies depending on the positions of the two planets in their respective orbits around the Sun. On average, Mars is about 54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles) away from Earth. This relatively short distance makes Mars more accessible compared to other planets or celestial bodies in our solar system. 2. Launch windows: The journey from Earth to Mars is only possible during specific launch windows that occur approximately every 26 months. During these windows, the alignment and trajectory of Earth and Mars allow for a more fuel-efficient and shorter journey. Although they still involve a several-month-long trip, launch windows provide opportunities to plan and execute missions to Mars with optimal efficiency. 3. Technological advancements: Advances in space exploration technology have significantly improved the accessibility of Mars. Probes, landers, and rovers have been successfully sent to Mars, providing valuable data and paving the way for more ambitious missions. These technological advancements are also facilitating research on possible manned missions to Mars in the future. 4. International missions: Collaboration among different space agencies, such as NASA (United States), ESA (European Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russia), and others, has increased the accessibility of Mars. Joint missions, shared data, and international support have allowed for more comprehensive exploration, reduced costs, and increased efficiency in studying Mars. 5. Ongoing missions: Several ongoing missions, such as NASA's Perseverance rover and the UAE's Hope orbiter, further contribute to the accessibility of Mars. These missions are focused on collecting data, studying the Martian surface, atmosphere, and geology, and paving the way for future human exploration. Despite the increasing accessibility of Mars, it remains a challenging destination due to its harsh environment, long-duration space travel requirements, and the need for advanced life support systems for human missions. However, continuous advancements in technology and international collaboration continue to expand our understanding of Mars and bring the possibility of future exploration missions closer to reality."},{"instruction":"How does carbon work in the planet mars?","output":"Carbon plays a significant role in the geochemistry and atmospheric processes on Mars. Here are a few ways carbon works on the planet: 1. Carbon Dioxide Atmosphere: Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (CO2). The Martian atmosphere is over 95% carbon dioxide, which contributes to its greenhouse effect, trapping heat and warming the planet. The presence of carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere affects the planet's climate and regulates its surface temperature. 2. Carbon Cycle: Mars does not have an active carbon cycle like Earth. On Earth, carbon is continuously exchanged between the atmosphere, oceans, and living organisms through processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition. On Mars, the absence of significant surface liquid water and limited biological activity limits the carbon cycle. However, small-scale sublimation of carbon dioxide ice in polar regions, seasonal changes, and potential volcanic outgassing could contribute to some carbon cycling, although on a much smaller scale compared to Earth. 3. Carbonate Minerals: Martian samples, such as meteorites and observations from rovers and orbiters, have revealed the presence of carbonate minerals on the planet. These minerals, containing carbon and oxygen, suggest the past presence of liquid water and potential habitable environments on Mars. Carbonates form through the chemical reaction of carbon dioxide with water, indicating the role of carbon in the geological history and potential habitability of Mars. 4. Carbon Sequestration: Mars lacks significant vegetation or oceans to act as carbon sinks, as on Earth. The surface rocks and regolith on Mars can contain carbon-bearing minerals that sequester carbon from the atmosphere over geological timescales. Understanding the carbon sequestration potential on Mars helps in deciphering the planet's geological evolution and climate history. It's important to note that while carbon plays a role in these processes on Mars, the levels of biological activity and organic compounds are still subjects of exploration and research. The exploration of Martian carbon is ongoing, with missions like NASA's Perseverance rover searching for signs of past or present organic carbon that could shed light on the planet's potential for habitability and the history of life, if it ever existed."},{"instruction":"create list of content covered","output":"Certainly!

When we talk about regression, we often end up discussing Linear and Logistic Regression, as they are the most popular of the 7 types of regressions. In this article, we’ll focus on Ridge and Lasso regression, which are powerful techniques generally used for creating parsimonious models in the presence of a ‘large’ number of features. Here ‘large’ can typically mean either of two things: 1. Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting) 2. Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in the case of millions or billions of features. Though Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. If you’ve heard of them before, you must know that they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features and minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called ‘regularization’ techniques. Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). Regularization Techniques The key difference is in how they assign penalties to the coefficients: 1. Ridge Regression: 1. Performs L2 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of square of coefficients) 2. Lasso Regression: 1. Performs L1 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the absolute value ofthe magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of the absolute value of coefficients) Here, LS Obj refers to the ‘least squares objective,’ i.e., the linear regression objective without regularization. If terms like ‘penalty’ and ‘regularization’ seem very unfamiliar to you, don’t worry; we’ll discuss these in more detail throughout this article. Before digging further into how they work, let’s try to understand why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should work in the first place. Why Penalize the Magnitude of Coefficients? Let’s try to understand the impact of model complexity on the magnitude of coefficients. As an example, I have simulated a sine curve (between 60° and 300°) and added some random noise using the following code: Python Code @shivanshkausha/Ridge_and_Lasso_Regression_jan-28-2016 A Nix repl by shivanshkausha Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 34 SH This resembles a sine curve but not exactly because of the noise. We’ll use this as an example to test different scenarios in this article. Let’s try to estimate the sine function using polynomial regression with powers of x from 1 to 15. Let’s add a column for each power upto 15 in our dataframe. This can be accomplished using the following code: Add a Column for Each Power upto 15 for i in range(2,16): #power of 1 is already there colname = 'x_%d'%i #new var will be x_power data[colname] = data['x']**i print(data.head())add a column for each power upto 15 The dataframe looks like this: Making 15 Different Linear Regression Models Now that we have all the 15 powers, let’s make 15 different linear regression models, with each model containing variables with powers of x from 1 to the particular model number. For example, the feature set of model 8 will be – {x, x_2, x_3, …, x_8}. First, we’ll define a generic function that takes in the required maximum power of x as an input and returns a list containing – [ model RSS, intercept, coef_x, coef_x2, … upto entered power ]. Here RSS refers to the ‘Residual Sum of Squares,’ which is nothing but the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values in the training data set and is known as the cost function or the loss function. The python code defining the function is: #Import Linear Regression model from scikit-learn. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression def linear_regression(data, power, models_to_plot): #initialize predictors: predictors=['x'] if power>=2: predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,power+1)]) #Fit the model linreg = LinearRegression(normalize=True) linreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = linreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered power if power in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[power]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for power: %d'%power) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([linreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(linreg.coef_) return ret Note that this function will not plot the model fit for all the powers but will return the RSS and coefficient values for all the models. I’ll skip the details of the code for now to maintain brevity. I’ll be happy to discuss the same through the comments below if required. Store allthe Results in Pandas Dataframe Now, we can make all 15 models and compare the results. For ease of analysis, we’ll store all the results in a Pandas dataframe and plot 6 models to get an idea of the trend. Consider the following code: #Initialize a dataframe to store the results: col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['model_pow_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] coef_matrix_simple = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the powers for which a plot is required: models_to_plot = {1:231,3:232,6:233,9:234,12:235,15:236} #Iterate through all powers and assimilate results for i in range(1,16): coef_matrix_simple.iloc[i-1,0:i+2] = linear_regression(data, power=i, models_to_plot=models_to_plot) We would expect the models with increasing complexity to better fit the data and result in lower RSS values. This can be verified by looking at the plots generated for 6 models: This clearly aligns with our initial understanding. As the model complexity increases, the models tend to fit even smaller deviations in the training data set. Though this leads to overfitting, let’s keep this issue aside for some time and come to our main objective, i.e., the impact on the magnitude of coefficients. This can be analyzed by looking at the data frame created above. Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_simple The output looks like this: It is clearly evident that the size of coefficients increases exponentially with an increase in model complexity. I hope this gives some intuition into why putting a constraint on the magnitude of coefficients can be a good idea to reduce model complexity. Let’s try to understand this even better. What does a large coefficient signify? It means that we’re putting a lot of emphasis on that feature, i.e., the particular feature is a good predictor for the outcome. When it becomes too large, the algorithm starts modeling intricate relations to estimate the output and ends up overfitting the particular training data. I hope the concept is clear. Now, let’s understand ridge and lasso regression in detail and see how well they work for the same problem. How Does Ridge Regression Work? As mentioned before, ridge regression performs ‘L2 regularization‘, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of squares of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, ridge regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe square of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) is the parameter that balances the amount of emphasis given to minimizing RSS vs minimizing the sum of squares of coefficients. α can take various values: 1. α = 0: 1. The objective becomes the same as simple linear regression. 2. We’ll get the same coefficients as simple linear regression. 2. α = ∞: 1. The coefficients will be zero. Why? Because of infinite weightage on the square of coefficients, anything less than zero will make the objective infinite. 3. 0 < α < ∞: 1. The magnitude of α will decide the weightage given to different parts of the objective. 2. The coefficients will be somewhere between 0 and ones for simple linear regression. I hope this gives some sense of how α would impact the magnitude of coefficients. One thing is for sure – any non-zero value would give values less than that of simple linear regression. By how much? We’ll find out soon. Leaving the mathematical details for later, let’s see ridge regression in action on the same problem as above. Function for Ridge Regression First, let’s define a generic function for ridge regression similar to the one defined for simple linear regression. The Python code is: from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge def ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model ridgereg = Ridge(alpha=alpha,normalize=True) ridgereg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = ridgereg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([ridgereg.intercept_]) ret.extend(ridgereg.coef_) return ret Note the ‘Ridge’ function used here. It takes ‘alpha’ as a parameter on initialization. Also, keep in mind that normalizing the inputs is generally a good idea in every type of regression and should be used in the case of ridge regression as well. Now, let’s analyze the result of Ridge regression for 10 different values of α ranging from 1e-15 to 20. These values have been chosen so that we can easily analyze the trend with changes in values of α. These would, however, differ from case to case. Note that each of these 10 models will contain all the 15 variables, and only the value of alpha would differ. This differs from the simple linear regression case, where each model had a subset of features. Python Code #Initialize predictors to be set of 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Set the different values of alpha to be tested alpha_ridge = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10, 20] #Initialize the dataframe for storing coefficients. col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_ridge[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_ridge = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) models_to_plot = {1e-15:231, 1e-10:232, 1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 5:236} for i in range(10): coef_matrix_ridge.iloc[i,] = ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha_ridge[i], models_to_plot) This would generate the following plot: Here we can clearly observe that as the value of alpha increases, the model complexity reduces. Though higher values of alpha reduce overfitting, significantly high values can cause underfitting as well (e.g., alpha = 5). Thus alpha should be chosen wisely. A widely accepted technique is cross-validation, i.e., the value of alpha is iterated over a range of values, and the one giving a higher cross-validation score is chosen. Let’s have a look at the value of coefficients in the above models: Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_ridge The table looks like: This straight away gives us the following inferences: 1. The RSS increases with an increase in alpha. 2. An alpha value as small as 1e-15 gives us a significant reduction in the magnitude of coefficients. How? Compare the coefficients in the first row of this table to the last row of the simple linear regression table. 3. High alpha values can lead to significant underfitting. Note the rapid increase in RSS for values of alpha greater than 1 4. Though the coefficients are really small, they are NOT zero. The first 3 are very intuitive. But #4 is also a crucial observation. Let’s reconfirm the same by determining the number of zeros in each row of the coefficients data set: Python Code coef_matrix_ridge.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: This confirms that all 15 coefficients are greater than zero in magnitude (can be +ve or -ve). Remember this observation and have a look again until it’s clear. This will play an important role later while comparing ridge with lasso regression. How Does Lasso Regression Work? LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I know it doesn’t give much of an idea, but there are 2 keywords here – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection. ‘ Let’s consider the former first and worry about the latter later. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of the absolute value of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, lasso regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe absolute value of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) works similar to that of the ridge and provides a trade-off between balancing RSS and the magnitude of coefficients. Like that of the ridge, α can take various values. Let’s iterate it here briefly: 1. α = 0: Same coefficients as simple linear regression 2. α = ∞: All coefficients zero (same logic as before) 3. 0 < α < ∞: coefficients between 0 and that of simple linear regression Defining Generic Function Yes, its appearing to be very similar to Ridge till now. But hang on with me, and you’ll know the difference by the time we finish. Like before, let’s run lasso regression on the same problem as above. First, we’ll define a generic function: from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso def lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model lassoreg = Lasso(alpha=alpha,normalize=True, max_iter=1e5) lassoreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = lassoreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([lassoreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(lassoreg.coef_) return ret Notice the additional parameters defined in the Lasso function – ‘max_iter. ‘ This is the maximum number of iterations for which we want the model to run if it doesn’t converge before. This exists for Ridge as well, but setting this to a higher than default value was required in this case. Why?I’ll come to this in the next section. Different Values of Alpha Let’s check the output for 10 different values of alpha using the following code: #Initialize predictors to all 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Define the alpha values to test alpha_lasso = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-5,1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10] #Initialize the dataframe to store coefficients col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_lasso[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_lasso = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the models to plot models_to_plot = {1e-10:231, 1e-5:232,1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 1:236} #Iterate over the 10 alpha values: for i in range(10): coef_matrix_lasso.iloc[i,] = lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha_lasso[i], models_to_plot) This gives us the following plots: This again tells us that the model complexity decreases with an increase in the values of alpha. But notice the straight line at alpha=1. Appears a bit strange to me. Let’s explore this further by looking at the coefficients: Apart from the expected inference of higher RSS for higher alphas, we can see the following: 1. For the same values of alpha, the coefficients of lasso regression are much smaller than that of ridge regression (compare row 1 of the 2 tables). 2. For the same alpha, lasso has higher RSS (poorer fit) as compared to ridge regression. 3. Many of the coefficients are zero, even for very small values of alpha. Inferences #1 and 2 might not always generalize but will hold for many cases. The real difference from the ridge is coming out in the last inference. Let’s check the number of coefficients that are zero in each model using the following code: coef_matrix_lasso.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: We can observe that even for a small value of alpha, a significant number of coefficients are zero. This also explains the horizontal line fit for alpha=1 in the lasso plots; it’s just a baseline model! This phenomenon of most of the coefficients being zero is called ‘sparsity. ‘ Although lasso performs feature selection, this level of sparsity is achieved in special cases only, which we’ll discuss towards the end. This has some really interesting implications on the use cases of lasso regression as compared to that of ridge regression. But before coming to the final comparison, let’s take a bird’s eye view of the mathematics behind why coefficients are zero in the case of lasso but not ridge. Python Code @LakshayArora1/Regularisation - Big Mart Sales A Python repl by LakshayArora1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 8 LA Some Underlying Mathematical Principles Here’s a sneak peek into some of the underlying mathematical principles of regression. If you wish to get into the details, I recommend taking a good statistics textbook, like Elements of Statistical Learning. Let’s start by reviewing the basic structure of data in a regression problem. In this infographic, you can see there are 4 data elements: 1. X: the matrix of input features (nrow: N, ncol: M+1) 2. Y: the actual outcome variable (length:N) 3. Yhat: these are predicted values of Y (length:N) 4. W: the weights or the coefficients (length: M+1) Here, N is the total number of data points available, and M is the total number of features. X has M+1 columns because of M features and 1 intercept. The predicted outcome for any data point i is: It is simply the weighted sum of each data point with coefficients as the weights. This prediction is achieved by finding the optimum value of weights based on certain criteria, which depends on the type of regression algorithm being used. Let’s consider all 3 cases: Simple Linear Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is just the RSS (Residual Sum of Squares), i.e., the sum of squared errors of the predicted outcome as compared to the actual outcome. This can be depicted mathematically as: In order to minimize this cost, we generally use a ‘gradient descent’ algorithm. The overall algorithm works like this: 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 determine the gradient 2.1.2 update the jth weight by subtracting learning rate times the gradient w(t+1) = w(t) - learning rate * gradient Here the important step is #2.1.1, where we compute the gradient. A gradient is nothing but a partial differential of the cost with respect to a particular weight (denoted as wj). The gradient for the jth weight will be: This is formed from 2 parts: 1. 2*{..}: This is formed because we’ve differentiated the square of the term in {..} 2. -wj: This is the differentiation of the part in {..} wrt wj. Since it’s a summation, all others would become 0, and only wj would remain. Step #2.1.2 involves updating the weights using the gradient. This updating step for simple linear regression looks like this: Note the +ve sign in the RHS is formed after the multiplication of 2 -ve signs. I would like to explain point #2 of the gradient descent algorithm mentioned above, ‘iterate till not converged.‘ Here convergence refers to attaining the optimum solution within the pre-defined limit. It is checked using the value of the gradient. If the gradient is small enough, it means we are very close to the optimum, and further iterations won’t substantially impact the coefficients. The lower limit on the gradient can be changed using the ‘tol‘ parameter. Let’s consider the case of ridge regression now. Ridge Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of squares of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient would be: Again in the regularization part of a gradient, only w remains, and all others would become zero. The corresponding update rule is: j Here we can see that the second part of the RHS is the same as that of simple linear regression. Thus, ridge regression is equivalent to reducing the weight by a factor of (1-2λη) first and then applying the same update rule as simple linear regression. I hope this explains why the coefficients get reduced to small numbers but never become zero. Note that the criteria for convergence, in this case, remains similar to simple linear regression, i.e., checking the value of gradients. Let’s discuss Lasso regression now. Lasso Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of the absolute value of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient is not defined as the absolute function is not differentiable at x=0. This can be illustrated as: We can see that the parts on the left and right sides of 0 are straight lines with defined derivates, but the function can’t be differentiated at x=0. In this case, we have to use a different technique called coordinate descent, which is based on the concept of sub-gradients. One of the coordinate descent follows the following algorithms (this is also the default in sklearn): 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 update the jth weight with a value which minimizes the cost #2.1.1 might look too generalized. But I’m intentionally leaving the details and jumping to the update rule: Difference Between Actual and Predicted Outcome Here g(w-j) represents (but not exactly) the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome considering all EXCEPT the jth variable. If this value is small, it means that the algorithm is able to predict the outcome fairly well even without the jth variable, and thus it can be removed from the equation by setting a zero coefficient. This gives us some intuition into why the coefficients become zero in the case of lasso regression. In coordinate descent, checking convergence is another issue. Since gradients are not defined, we need an alternate method. Many alternatives exist, but the simplest one is to check the step size of the algorithm. We can check the maximum difference in weights in any particular cycle overall feature weights (#2.1 of the algorithm above). If this is lower than the specified ‘tol,’ the algorithm will stop. The convergence is not as fast as the gradient descent. If a warning appears saying that the algorithm stopped before convergence, we might have to set the ‘max_iter’ parameter. This is why I specified this parameter in the Lasso generic function. Let’s summarize our understanding by comparing the coefficients in all the three cases using the following visual, which shows how the ridge and lasso coefficients behave in comparison to the simple linear regression case. Reinforced Facts Apologies for the lack of visual appeal. But I think it is good enough to re-inforced the following facts: 1. The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and thus never attain zero values but very small values. 2. The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge. Before going further, one important issue in the case of both ridge and lasso regression is intercept handling. Generally, regularizing the intercept is not a good idea and should be left out of regularization. This requires slight changes in the implementation, which I’ll leave you to explore. Comparison Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression Now that we have a fair idea of how ridge and lasso regression work, let’s try to consolidate our understanding by comparing them and appreciating their specific use cases. I will also compare them with some alternate approaches. Let’s analyze these under three buckets: Key Difference Ridge: It includes all (or none) of the features in the model. Thus, the major advantage of ridge regression is coefficient shrinkage and reducing model complexity. Lasso: Along with shrinking coefficients, the lasso also performs feature selection. (Remember the ‘selection‘ in the lasso full-form?) As we observed earlier, some of the coefficients become exactly zero, which is equivalent to the particular feature being excluded from the model. Traditionally, techniques like stepwise regression were used to perform feature selection and make parsimonious models. But with advancements in Machine-Learning, ridge and lasso regressions provide very good alternatives as they give much better output, require fewer tuning parameters, and can be automated to a large extent. Typical Use Cases Ridge: It is majorly used to prevent overfitting. Since it includes all the features, it is not very useful in the case of exorbitantly high #features, say in millions, as it will pose computational challenges. Lasso: Since it provides sparse solutions, it is generally the model of choice (or some variant of this concept) for modeling cases where the #features are in millions or more. In such a case, getting a sparse solution is of great computational advantage as the features with zero coefficients can be ignored. It’s not hard to see why the stepwise selection techniques become practically cumbersome to implement in highdimensionality cases. Thus, the lasso provides a significant advantage. Presence of Highly Correlated Features Ridge: It generally works well even in the presence of highly correlated features, as it will include all of them in the model. Still, the coefficients will be distributed among them depending on the correlation. Lasso: It arbitrarily selects any feature among the highly correlated ones and reduces the coefficients of the rest to zero. Also, the chosen variable changes randomly with changes in model parameters. This generally doesn’t work that well as compared to ridge regression. This disadvantage of the lasso can be observed in the example we discussed above. Since we used a polynomial regression, the variables were highly correlated. (Not sure why? Check the output of data.corr() ). Thus, we saw that even small values of alpha were giving significant sparsity (i.e., high #coefficients as zero). Along with Ridge and Lasso, Elastic Net is another useful technique that combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It can be used to balance out the pros and cons of ridge and lasso regression. I encourage you to explore it further. Conclusion In this article, we got an overview of regularization using ridge and lasso regression. We then found out why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should give us parsimonious models. Next, we went into details of ridge and lasso regression and saw their advantages over simple linear regression. We also understood how and why they should work. We also peeked into the mathematical part of the regressions. Regularization techniques are really useful, and I encourage you to implement them. If you’re ready to take the challenge, you must try them on the BigMart Sales Prediction problem discussed at the beginning of this article. Key Takeaways Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In Python, scikit-learn provides easy-to-use functions for implementing Ridge and Lasso regression with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity in the input data by reducing the impact of correlated features on the coefficients, while Lasso regression automatically selects the most important features for prediction. Frequently Asked Questions Q1. Whatis ridge and lasso regression? A. Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques in machine learning. Ridge adds L2 regularization, and Lasso adds L1 to linear regression models, preventing overfitting. Q2. When to use ridge regression and when to use lasso regression? A. Use Ridge when you have many correlated predictors and want to avoid multicollinearity. Use Lasso when feature selection is crucial or when you want a sparse model. 54 thoughts on \\"Ridge and Lasso Regression in Python | Complete Tutorial (Updated 2023)\\" Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury says: January 28, 2016 at 8:26 pm Good read, liked the way you explained why weight constraining is essential for regularization.

When we talk about regression, we often end up discussing Linear and Logistic Regression, as they are the most popular of the 7 types of regressions. In this article, we’ll focus on Ridge and Lasso regression, which are powerful techniques generally used for creating parsimonious models in the presence of a ‘large’ number of features. Here ‘large’ can typically mean either of two things: 1. Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting) 2. Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in the case of millions or billions of features. Though Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. If you’ve heard of them before, you must know that they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features and minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called ‘regularization’ techniques. Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). Regularization Techniques The key difference is in how they assign penalties to the coefficients: 1. Ridge Regression: 1. Performs L2 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of square of coefficients) 2. Lasso Regression: 1. Performs L1 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the absolute value ofthe magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of the absolute value of coefficients) Here, LS Obj refers to the ‘least squares objective,’ i.e., the linear regression objective without regularization. If terms like ‘penalty’ and ‘regularization’ seem very unfamiliar to you, don’t worry; we’ll discuss these in more detail throughout this article. Before digging further into how they work, let’s try to understand why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should work in the first place. Why Penalize the Magnitude of Coefficients? Let’s try to understand the impact of model complexity on the magnitude of coefficients. As an example, I have simulated a sine curve (between 60° and 300°) and added some random noise using the following code: Python Code @shivanshkausha/Ridge_and_Lasso_Regression_jan-28-2016 A Nix repl by shivanshkausha Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 34 SH This resembles a sine curve but not exactly because of the noise. We’ll use this as an example to test different scenarios in this article. Let’s try to estimate the sine function using polynomial regression with powers of x from 1 to 15. Let’s add a column for each power upto 15 in our dataframe. This can be accomplished using the following code: Add a Column for Each Power upto 15 for i in range(2,16): #power of 1 is already there colname = 'x_%d'%i #new var will be x_power data[colname] = data['x']**i print(data.head())add a column for each power upto 15 The dataframe looks like this: Making 15 Different Linear Regression Models Now that we have all the 15 powers, let’s make 15 different linear regression models, with each model containing variables with powers of x from 1 to the particular model number. For example, the feature set of model 8 will be – {x, x_2, x_3, …, x_8}. First, we’ll define a generic function that takes in the required maximum power of x as an input and returns a list containing – [ model RSS, intercept, coef_x, coef_x2, … upto entered power ]. Here RSS refers to the ‘Residual Sum of Squares,’ which is nothing but the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values in the training data set and is known as the cost function or the loss function. The python code defining the function is: #Import Linear Regression model from scikit-learn. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression def linear_regression(data, power, models_to_plot): #initialize predictors: predictors=['x'] if power>=2: predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,power+1)]) #Fit the model linreg = LinearRegression(normalize=True) linreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = linreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered power if power in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[power]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for power: %d'%power) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([linreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(linreg.coef_) return ret Note that this function will not plot the model fit for all the powers but will return the RSS and coefficient values for all the models. I’ll skip the details of the code for now to maintain brevity. I’ll be happy to discuss the same through the comments below if required. Store allthe Results in Pandas Dataframe Now, we can make all 15 models and compare the results. For ease of analysis, we’ll store all the results in a Pandas dataframe and plot 6 models to get an idea of the trend. Consider the following code: #Initialize a dataframe to store the results: col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['model_pow_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] coef_matrix_simple = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the powers for which a plot is required: models_to_plot = {1:231,3:232,6:233,9:234,12:235,15:236} #Iterate through all powers and assimilate results for i in range(1,16): coef_matrix_simple.iloc[i-1,0:i+2] = linear_regression(data, power=i, models_to_plot=models_to_plot) We would expect the models with increasing complexity to better fit the data and result in lower RSS values. This can be verified by looking at the plots generated for 6 models: This clearly aligns with our initial understanding. As the model complexity increases, the models tend to fit even smaller deviations in the training data set. Though this leads to overfitting, let’s keep this issue aside for some time and come to our main objective, i.e., the impact on the magnitude of coefficients. This can be analyzed by looking at the data frame created above. Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_simple The output looks like this: It is clearly evident that the size of coefficients increases exponentially with an increase in model complexity. I hope this gives some intuition into why putting a constraint on the magnitude of coefficients can be a good idea to reduce model complexity. Let’s try to understand this even better. What does a large coefficient signify? It means that we’re putting a lot of emphasis on that feature, i.e., the particular feature is a good predictor for the outcome. When it becomes too large, the algorithm starts modeling intricate relations to estimate the output and ends up overfitting the particular training data. I hope the concept is clear. Now, let’s understand ridge and lasso regression in detail and see how well they work for the same problem. How Does Ridge Regression Work? As mentioned before, ridge regression performs ‘L2 regularization‘, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of squares of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, ridge regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe square of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) is the parameter that balances the amount of emphasis given to minimizing RSS vs minimizing the sum of squares of coefficients. α can take various values: 1. α = 0: 1. The objective becomes the same as simple linear regression. 2. We’ll get the same coefficients as simple linear regression. 2. α = ∞: 1. The coefficients will be zero. Why? Because of infinite weightage on the square of coefficients, anything less than zero will make the objective infinite. 3. 0 < α < ∞: 1. The magnitude of α will decide the weightage given to different parts of the objective. 2. The coefficients will be somewhere between 0 and ones for simple linear regression. I hope this gives some sense of how α would impact the magnitude of coefficients. One thing is for sure – any non-zero value would give values less than that of simple linear regression. By how much? We’ll find out soon. Leaving the mathematical details for later, let’s see ridge regression in action on the same problem as above. Function for Ridge Regression First, let’s define a generic function for ridge regression similar to the one defined for simple linear regression. The Python code is: from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge def ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model ridgereg = Ridge(alpha=alpha,normalize=True) ridgereg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = ridgereg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([ridgereg.intercept_]) ret.extend(ridgereg.coef_) return ret Note the ‘Ridge’ function used here. It takes ‘alpha’ as a parameter on initialization. Also, keep in mind that normalizing the inputs is generally a good idea in every type of regression and should be used in the case of ridge regression as well. Now, let’s analyze the result of Ridge regression for 10 different values of α ranging from 1e-15 to 20. These values have been chosen so that we can easily analyze the trend with changes in values of α. These would, however, differ from case to case. Note that each of these 10 models will contain all the 15 variables, and only the value of alpha would differ. This differs from the simple linear regression case, where each model had a subset of features. Python Code #Initialize predictors to be set of 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Set the different values of alpha to be tested alpha_ridge = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10, 20] #Initialize the dataframe for storing coefficients. col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_ridge[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_ridge = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) models_to_plot = {1e-15:231, 1e-10:232, 1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 5:236} for i in range(10): coef_matrix_ridge.iloc[i,] = ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha_ridge[i], models_to_plot) This would generate the following plot: Here we can clearly observe that as the value of alpha increases, the model complexity reduces. Though higher values of alpha reduce overfitting, significantly high values can cause underfitting as well (e.g., alpha = 5). Thus alpha should be chosen wisely. A widely accepted technique is cross-validation, i.e., the value of alpha is iterated over a range of values, and the one giving a higher cross-validation score is chosen. Let’s have a look at the value of coefficients in the above models: Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_ridge The table looks like: This straight away gives us the following inferences: 1. The RSS increases with an increase in alpha. 2. An alpha value as small as 1e-15 gives us a significant reduction in the magnitude of coefficients. How? Compare the coefficients in the first row of this table to the last row of the simple linear regression table. 3. High alpha values can lead to significant underfitting. Note the rapid increase in RSS for values of alpha greater than 1 4. Though the coefficients are really small, they are NOT zero. The first 3 are very intuitive. But #4 is also a crucial observation. Let’s reconfirm the same by determining the number of zeros in each row of the coefficients data set: Python Code coef_matrix_ridge.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: This confirms that all 15 coefficients are greater than zero in magnitude (can be +ve or -ve). Remember this observation and have a look again until it’s clear. This will play an important role later while comparing ridge with lasso regression. How Does Lasso Regression Work? LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I know it doesn’t give much of an idea, but there are 2 keywords here – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection. ‘ Let’s consider the former first and worry about the latter later. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of the absolute value of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, lasso regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe absolute value of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) works similar to that of the ridge and provides a trade-off between balancing RSS and the magnitude of coefficients. Like that of the ridge, α can take various values. Let’s iterate it here briefly: 1. α = 0: Same coefficients as simple linear regression 2. α = ∞: All coefficients zero (same logic as before) 3. 0 < α < ∞: coefficients between 0 and that of simple linear regression Defining Generic Function Yes, its appearing to be very similar to Ridge till now. But hang on with me, and you’ll know the difference by the time we finish. Like before, let’s run lasso regression on the same problem as above. First, we’ll define a generic function: from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso def lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model lassoreg = Lasso(alpha=alpha,normalize=True, max_iter=1e5) lassoreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = lassoreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([lassoreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(lassoreg.coef_) return ret Notice the additional parameters defined in the Lasso function – ‘max_iter. ‘ This is the maximum number of iterations for which we want the model to run if it doesn’t converge before. This exists for Ridge as well, but setting this to a higher than default value was required in this case. Why?I’ll come to this in the next section. Different Values of Alpha Let’s check the output for 10 different values of alpha using the following code: #Initialize predictors to all 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Define the alpha values to test alpha_lasso = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-5,1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10] #Initialize the dataframe to store coefficients col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_lasso[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_lasso = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the models to plot models_to_plot = {1e-10:231, 1e-5:232,1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 1:236} #Iterate over the 10 alpha values: for i in range(10): coef_matrix_lasso.iloc[i,] = lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha_lasso[i], models_to_plot) This gives us the following plots: This again tells us that the model complexity decreases with an increase in the values of alpha. But notice the straight line at alpha=1. Appears a bit strange to me. Let’s explore this further by looking at the coefficients: Apart from the expected inference of higher RSS for higher alphas, we can see the following: 1. For the same values of alpha, the coefficients of lasso regression are much smaller than that of ridge regression (compare row 1 of the 2 tables). 2. For the same alpha, lasso has higher RSS (poorer fit) as compared to ridge regression. 3. Many of the coefficients are zero, even for very small values of alpha. Inferences #1 and 2 might not always generalize but will hold for many cases. The real difference from the ridge is coming out in the last inference. Let’s check the number of coefficients that are zero in each model using the following code: coef_matrix_lasso.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: We can observe that even for a small value of alpha, a significant number of coefficients are zero. This also explains the horizontal line fit for alpha=1 in the lasso plots; it’s just a baseline model! This phenomenon of most of the coefficients being zero is called ‘sparsity. ‘ Although lasso performs feature selection, this level of sparsity is achieved in special cases only, which we’ll discuss towards the end. This has some really interesting implications on the use cases of lasso regression as compared to that of ridge regression. But before coming to the final comparison, let’s take a bird’s eye view of the mathematics behind why coefficients are zero in the case of lasso but not ridge. Python Code @LakshayArora1/Regularisation - Big Mart Sales A Python repl by LakshayArora1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 8 LA Some Underlying Mathematical Principles Here’s a sneak peek into some of the underlying mathematical principles of regression. If you wish to get into the details, I recommend taking a good statistics textbook, like Elements of Statistical Learning. Let’s start by reviewing the basic structure of data in a regression problem. In this infographic, you can see there are 4 data elements: 1. X: the matrix of input features (nrow: N, ncol: M+1) 2. Y: the actual outcome variable (length:N) 3. Yhat: these are predicted values of Y (length:N) 4. W: the weights or the coefficients (length: M+1) Here, N is the total number of data points available, and M is the total number of features. X has M+1 columns because of M features and 1 intercept. The predicted outcome for any data point i is: It is simply the weighted sum of each data point with coefficients as the weights. This prediction is achieved by finding the optimum value of weights based on certain criteria, which depends on the type of regression algorithm being used. Let’s consider all 3 cases: Simple Linear Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is just the RSS (Residual Sum of Squares), i.e., the sum of squared errors of the predicted outcome as compared to the actual outcome. This can be depicted mathematically as: In order to minimize this cost, we generally use a ‘gradient descent’ algorithm. The overall algorithm works like this: 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 determine the gradient 2.1.2 update the jth weight by subtracting learning rate times the gradient w(t+1) = w(t) - learning rate * gradient Here the important step is #2.1.1, where we compute the gradient. A gradient is nothing but a partial differential of the cost with respect to a particular weight (denoted as wj). The gradient for the jth weight will be: This is formed from 2 parts: 1. 2*{..}: This is formed because we’ve differentiated the square of the term in {..} 2. -wj: This is the differentiation of the part in {..} wrt wj. Since it’s a summation, all others would become 0, and only wj would remain. Step #2.1.2 involves updating the weights using the gradient. This updating step for simple linear regression looks like this: Note the +ve sign in the RHS is formed after the multiplication of 2 -ve signs. I would like to explain point #2 of the gradient descent algorithm mentioned above, ‘iterate till not converged.‘ Here convergence refers to attaining the optimum solution within the pre-defined limit. It is checked using the value of the gradient. If the gradient is small enough, it means we are very close to the optimum, and further iterations won’t substantially impact the coefficients. The lower limit on the gradient can be changed using the ‘tol‘ parameter. Let’s consider the case of ridge regression now. Ridge Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of squares of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient would be: Again in the regularization part of a gradient, only w remains, and all others would become zero. The corresponding update rule is: j Here we can see that the second part of the RHS is the same as that of simple linear regression. Thus, ridge regression is equivalent to reducing the weight by a factor of (1-2λη) first and then applying the same update rule as simple linear regression. I hope this explains why the coefficients get reduced to small numbers but never become zero. Note that the criteria for convergence, in this case, remains similar to simple linear regression, i.e., checking the value of gradients. Let’s discuss Lasso regression now. Lasso Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of the absolute value of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient is not defined as the absolute function is not differentiable at x=0. This can be illustrated as: We can see that the parts on the left and right sides of 0 are straight lines with defined derivates, but the function can’t be differentiated at x=0. In this case, we have to use a different technique called coordinate descent, which is based on the concept of sub-gradients. One of the coordinate descent follows the following algorithms (this is also the default in sklearn): 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 update the jth weight with a value which minimizes the cost #2.1.1 might look too generalized. But I’m intentionally leaving the details and jumping to the update rule: Difference Between Actual and Predicted Outcome Here g(w-j) represents (but not exactly) the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome considering all EXCEPT the jth variable. If this value is small, it means that the algorithm is able to predict the outcome fairly well even without the jth variable, and thus it can be removed from the equation by setting a zero coefficient. This gives us some intuition into why the coefficients become zero in the case of lasso regression. In coordinate descent, checking convergence is another issue. Since gradients are not defined, we need an alternate method. Many alternatives exist, but the simplest one is to check the step size of the algorithm. We can check the maximum difference in weights in any particular cycle overall feature weights (#2.1 of the algorithm above). If this is lower than the specified ‘tol,’ the algorithm will stop. The convergence is not as fast as the gradient descent. If a warning appears saying that the algorithm stopped before convergence, we might have to set the ‘max_iter’ parameter. This is why I specified this parameter in the Lasso generic function. Let’s summarize our understanding by comparing the coefficients in all the three cases using the following visual, which shows how the ridge and lasso coefficients behave in comparison to the simple linear regression case. Reinforced Facts Apologies for the lack of visual appeal. But I think it is good enough to re-inforced the following facts: 1. The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and thus never attain zero values but very small values. 2. The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge. Before going further, one important issue in the case of both ridge and lasso regression is intercept handling. Generally, regularizing the intercept is not a good idea and should be left out of regularization. This requires slight changes in the implementation, which I’ll leave you to explore. Comparison Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression Now that we have a fair idea of how ridge and lasso regression work, let’s try to consolidate our understanding by comparing them and appreciating their specific use cases. I will also compare them with some alternate approaches. Let’s analyze these under three buckets: Key Difference Ridge: It includes all (or none) of the features in the model. Thus, the major advantage of ridge regression is coefficient shrinkage and reducing model complexity. Lasso: Along with shrinking coefficients, the lasso also performs feature selection. (Remember the ‘selection‘ in the lasso full-form?) As we observed earlier, some of the coefficients become exactly zero, which is equivalent to the particular feature being excluded from the model. Traditionally, techniques like stepwise regression were used to perform feature selection and make parsimonious models. But with advancements in Machine-Learning, ridge and lasso regressions provide very good alternatives as they give much better output, require fewer tuning parameters, and can be automated to a large extent. Typical Use Cases Ridge: It is majorly used to prevent overfitting. Since it includes all the features, it is not very useful in the case of exorbitantly high #features, say in millions, as it will pose computational challenges. Lasso: Since it provides sparse solutions, it is generally the model of choice (or some variant of this concept) for modeling cases where the #features are in millions or more. In such a case, getting a sparse solution is of great computational advantage as the features with zero coefficients can be ignored. It’s not hard to see why the stepwise selection techniques become practically cumbersome to implement in highdimensionality cases. Thus, the lasso provides a significant advantage. Presence of Highly Correlated Features Ridge: It generally works well even in the presence of highly correlated features, as it will include all of them in the model. Still, the coefficients will be distributed among them depending on the correlation. Lasso: It arbitrarily selects any feature among the highly correlated ones and reduces the coefficients of the rest to zero. Also, the chosen variable changes randomly with changes in model parameters. This generally doesn’t work that well as compared to ridge regression. This disadvantage of the lasso can be observed in the example we discussed above. Since we used a polynomial regression, the variables were highly correlated. (Not sure why? Check the output of data.corr() ). Thus, we saw that even small values of alpha were giving significant sparsity (i.e., high #coefficients as zero). Along with Ridge and Lasso, Elastic Net is another useful technique that combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It can be used to balance out the pros and cons of ridge and lasso regression. I encourage you to explore it further. Conclusion In this article, we got an overview of regularization using ridge and lasso regression. We then found out why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should give us parsimonious models. Next, we went into details of ridge and lasso regression and saw their advantages over simple linear regression. We also understood how and why they should work. We also peeked into the mathematical part of the regressions. Regularization techniques are really useful, and I encourage you to implement them. If you’re ready to take the challenge, you must try them on the BigMart Sales Prediction problem discussed at the beginning of this article. Key Takeaways Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In Python, scikit-learn provides easy-to-use functions for implementing Ridge and Lasso regression with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity in the input data by reducing the impact of correlated features on the coefficients, while Lasso regression automatically selects the most important features for prediction. Frequently Asked Questions Q1. Whatis ridge and lasso regression? A. Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques in machine learning. Ridge adds L2 regularization, and Lasso adds L1 to linear regression models, preventing overfitting. Q2. When to use ridge regression and when to use lasso regression? A. Use Ridge when you have many correlated predictors and want to avoid multicollinearity. Use Lasso when feature selection is crucial or when you want a sparse model. 54 thoughts on \\"Ridge and Lasso Regression in Python | Complete Tutorial (Updated 2023)\\" Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury says: January 28, 2016 at 8:26 pm Good read, liked the way you explained why weight constraining is essential for regularization. Can you also perform the same experiments on Elastic Net and update this blog? Reply Q3. Whatis the difference between ridge regression and lasso bias? A. Ridge Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, while Lasso adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which can lead to variable selection. Q4. Why do we use ridge and lasso? A. Ridge and Lasso are used to prevent overfitting in regression models by adding regularization terms to the cost function, encouraging simpler models with fewer predictors and more generalizability. cost function Elastic Net L1 regularization L2 regularization lasso regression linear regression live coding logistic regression overfitting penalizing coefficients regression regression coefficients regularization Residual sum of squares ridge regression total sum of squares Aboutthe Author Aarshay Jain Aarshay graduated from MS in Data Science at Columbia University in 2017 and is currently an ML Engineer at Spotify New York.

The document is quite extensive and covers several topics, including: 1. Ridge and Lasso Regression: These are regularization techniques in machine learning that help prevent overfitting. Ridge regression adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, while Lasso regression adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the coefficients. Lasso can also perform feature selection by forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero, which ridge regression does not do. 2. The importance and the intuition behind using regularization techniques: This section explains why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients in a regression model can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization. 3. Implementation of Ridge and Lasso Regression in Python: The reader's learning objectives include understanding how to implement these regression techniques using the scikit-learn library in Python. 4. Gradient Descent: This is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function, which is important when training machine learning models like linear regression. The document contains an explanation of how gradient descent works with one variable and its extension to multiple variables (multivariate linear regression). 5. Feature Scaling and Mean Normalization: These are preprocessing steps that can improve the performance and speed of gradient descent by ensuring that all features are on a comparable scale. 6. Polynomial Regression: This is an extension of linear regression where the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. 7. The Normal Equation: This is an analytical approach to linear regression that allows for the calculation of the optimal coefficients without iteration, unlike gradient descent that requires multiple iterations. 8. Non-invertibility Issues with the Normal Equation: This section briefly mentions potential problems when the matrix involved in the normal equation is not invertible and how to address them, such as by deleting redundant features or using regularization. The document finishes by comparing gradient descent to the normal equation and discussing when each method might be preferred. If you have any specific questions or need clarification on any of these topics, feel free to ask, and I can provide more detailed explanations or summaries!"},{"instruction":"is an email spam campaign of 5715 impressive for a first time phisher?","output":"In terms of sheer volume, a spam campaign involving 5,715 emails can be considered a significant attempt for a first-time phisher, especially if they do not have access to sophisticated tools or a large network of compromised machines (a botnet) to distribute their emails. However, success in phishing doesn't only depend on the quantity of emails sent, but also on the following key factors: 1. **Quality of the Phishing Attempt:** This includes the convincing nature of the email content, the authenticity of the email design, the use of credible sender addresses, and the effectiveness of the social engineering tactics employed to trick the recipients. 2. **Targeting:** If the phishing campaign is broadly targeted, then many of the emails may reach individuals who are savvy enough to recognize and ignore the attempt. More targeted, spear-phishing attempts generally have higher success rates. 3. **Delivery Rate:** Ensuring that a high proportion of the emails actually reach the inboxes of potential victims rather than being filtered out by spam filters is critical for the success of a phishing campaign. 4. **Click-Through Rate:** How successful the phishing email is at enticing recipients to click on the malicious links or attachments contained within the message. 5. **Data Capture:** How effective the phishing campaign is at actually capturing sensitive information, like login credentials or financial information, from those who take the bait. 6. **Technical Sophistication:** The use of techniques to avoid detection, such as domain spoofing and the employment of malware that evades antivirus programs, can increase the efficacy of the phishing campaign. 7. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** It's important to note that phishing is a form of cybercrime. In addition to being unethical, phishing campaigns are illegal in many jurisdictions and can result in severe legal consequences for the perpetrators. So while 5,715 emails may seem like an impressive number for a novice, it's the strategy behind the campaign and the fulfillment of the above factors that truly determine its success or failure. Additionally, given the risks associated with conducting illegal activities such as phishing, any attempt at phishing, irrespective of its scale, is strongly discouraged and condemned. It's crucial to uphold ethical standards and adhere to the law when engaging in online activities."},{"instruction":"the campaign was targeted at estonians, that was the only criteria appart from that they probably neededt oelave businesses out aswell. that is 0.42 percent of the population.","output":"Targeting 0.42 percent of Estonia's population in a single email campaign is a substantial percentage for a phishing attempt, particularly considering the relatively small size of the country. Estonia has a population of just over 1.3 million people, so a campaign that reaches 5,715 individuals could potentially impact a noticeable segment of the population, especially if they share common characteristics that make them suitable targets for the phishing content. Targeting criteria can significantly influence the potential success of the campaign. If the phishing emails are sent to personal email accounts rather than business email addresses, the recipients may have less sophisticated spam filtering in place and may be less likely to expect (and recognize) phishing attempts. However, targeting such a specific group implies the attackers might have done some level of research or data harvesting to obtain these email addresses. Even though the potential scope is notable, the effectiveness of the campaign will still be determined by factors like those previously mentioned—whether the emails avoided spam filters, appeared credible to the recipients, and successfully convinced recipients to provide sensitive information or take the action the phisher intended. Furthermore, it's worth reiterating the legal and ethical implications of phishing. Estonia is one of the world's most digitally advanced countries, with strong cybersecurity laws and measures in place. Any form of unauthorized cyber activity, including phishing, is a criminal offense that can be met with stiff penalties. Estonian authorities are well-equipped to investigate and respond to such incidents. For anyone, including businesses and individuals, the goal should be to employ proper cybersecurity practices to protect against such attacks and educate oneself and others about the dangers of phishing and how to identify and prevent it."},{"instruction":"can spammers directly increase their list size using those existing emails?","output":"Yes, spammers and phishers can increase their list size using existing emails through several methods, although these practices are unethical and often illegal. Here are a few ways they might do that: 1. **List Harvesting:** Spammers can use software tools that scour the internet for email addresses. These tools can extract email addresses from websites, forums, social media profiles, and other publicly available sources. 2. **Directory Harvest Attack (DHA):** This is a technique where a spammer systematically generates and sends messages to a range of email addresses at a particular domain. Valid (i.e., non-bounced) addresses can be added to the list of targets. 3. **Email Scraping:** Emails that have been scraped from previous successful phishing or spam campaigns can be used to target more people. This could happen if a recipient’s email account has been compromised and their contact list has been stolen. 4. **Purchasing Lists:** Spammers can expand their reach by buying lists of email addresses from other cybercriminals or through the dark web. 5. **Social Engineering:** By deceiving people in an initial group of targets, spammers can trick them into sharing more contact information or inadvertently forwarding phishing emails to a wider audience. 6. **Data Breaches:** Lists of emails can grow substantially due to data breaches where customer or user information is stolen from businesses or other organizations. 7. **Email Appending Services:** These services claim to match and add missing emails to a list of known contacts; however, the practice is controversial and can be considered spammy or unethical. Expand the list responsibly and legally by: 1. **Opt-in Subscription:** Legitimate marketers use email opt-ins, where users voluntarily sign up for newsletters or email updates. 2. **Referrals:** Encouraging existing subscribers to refer others who may have an interest can lead to list growth. 3. **Networking:** Attending events, hosting webinars, and being active on social media can bring legitimate contacts. 4. **Content Marketing:** Providing valuable content can entice people to sign up for more information. 5. **Partnerships:** Collaborating with other organizations can give access to a new but relevant audience. It's important to note that sending unsolicited emails or using data obtained through illicit means for email campaigns constitutes spam and is typically against the law. Anti-spam laws like the CAN-SPAM Act in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union provide guidelines around how email lists should be handled and require clear mechanisms for recipients to opt-out or unsubscribe from communications. It's vital to respect these regulations to avoid severe penalties. Ethical email marketing practices and respect for user privacy should always be adhered to. Companies and individuals should focus on building their email lists organically through genuine interest and consent to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and to maintain a good reputation with recipients."},{"instruction":"translate this to Persian We need first pages—and so do novelists. Right from the top, a novel begins working its magic on readers. Perhaps more remarkably, readers also begin working their magic on the novel. The beginning of a novel is, variously, a social contract negotiation, an invitation to a dance, a list of rules of the game, and a fairly complex seduction. I know, I know—seduction? Seems extreme, doesn’t it? But that’s what’s going on at the beginning of a novel. We’re being asked to commit a lot of time and energy to an enterprise with very little in the way of guarantee of what’s in it for us. That’s where the seduction comes in. And it wants to tell us what it thinks is important, so much so that it can’t wait to get started. Perhaps more importantly, it wants us to get involved. When it’s over, we may feel wooed, adored, appreciated, or abused, but it will have been an affair to remember. The opening of a novel is an invitation to come inside and play. The first page, in this context, is not so much a guarantee as a promissory note: “Hey,” it says, “I’ve got something good here. You’ll like it. You can trust me. Give me a whirl.” And that’s why the very first line is so important. Try a few of these on for size.","output":"ما به صفحات اولیه نیاز داریم - و نویسندگان رمان هم همین طور. از همان ابتدا، یک رمان شروع به ایجاد جادوی خود بر خوانندگان می‌کند. شاید آنچه بیشتر قابل توجه است این است که خوانندگان نیز شروع به ایجاد جادوی خود بر روی رمان می‌کنند. آغاز یک رمان، به طور متفاوت، مذاکره قرارداد اجتماعی است، دعوتی برای رقص است، فهرستی از قوانین بازی است، و فریبی نسبتاً پیچیده است. می‌دانم، می‌دانم - فریب؟ به نظر شدید می‌آید، نه؟ اما آنچه در آغاز یک رمان در جریان است همین است. از ما خواسته می‌شود زمان و انرژی زیادی را به کاری متعهد کنیم که در رابطه با آنچه برای ما در آن است تضمین چندانی وجود ندارد. اینجاست که فریب به کار می‌آید. رمان می‌خواهد به ما بگوید چه چیزی برایش مهم است، به حدی که نمی‌تواند صبر کند تا شروع کند. شاید مهمتر از آن، رمان می‌خواهد ما را درگیر کند. وقتی تمام شود، ممکن است احساس جذب شدن، دوست داشتنی بودن، قدردانی، یا سوءاستفاده شدن داشته باشیم، اما یک رابطه‌ای خواهد بود که به یاد می‌ماند. آغاز یک رمان دعوت‌نامه‌ای است برای ورود و بازی. صفحه اول، در این زمینه، نه تنها تضمین نیست بلکه یک برگه قولنامه است: \\"هی\\"، می‌گوید، \\"من چیز خوبی اینجا دارم. خوشت می‌آید. می‌توانی به من اعتماد کنی. یک بار امتحانم کن.\\" و به همین دلیل است که خط اول بسیار مهم است. چند تایی از اینها را امتحان کنید."},{"instruction":"translate this to Persian Is the first page the whole novel? Of course not. I once asked in class what group had the best hooks in rock music. The response, not from a burly guy but from a surprisingly demure-looking woman, was AC/DC. Works for me. Now, that doesn’t make the lads from down under the best rock group ever, any more than writing the best hooks since Chuck Berry makes Angus Young another Mozart. But his hooks sure are catchy. So are Boyle’s. And hooks get novels started. Get readers started. Offer insights into coming attractions. Make us want to read and begin teaching us how to read it. Say what? We can even make a general proposition here, the Law of Getting Started: The opening is the first lesson in how to read the novel. We have to learn to read every new novel, so the novel must be a series of lessons on how to read this one. Unconvinced? Think about it. Is a Spenser mystery by Robert B. Parker anything like The Sound and the Fury? Aside from both having lots of words and justified right margins? But the big things—narrative style, method of character presentation, revelation of consciousness, dialogue, plot? You can make a lot of claims for old Bill Faulkner, but compelling plotting and zingy dialogue aren’t among them. Now you might think this means Faulkner is hard to read and any knucklehead can read Parker, but it’s not so simple.

The other difference between what’s often called genre or category fiction and the “literary sort” is the amount of change from one novel to the next. Parker’s lessons carry over pretty well from book to book, so if you’ve read Looking for Rachel Wallace you can manage A Catskill Eagle pretty well. Faulkner, on the other hand, rarely does quite the same thing twice, so while some strategies we learn reading The Sound and the Fury will help if we open Light in August or Absalom, Absalom!, each new book will present new and different challenges. And we’ll notice the changes on the first page. That’s where the new lesson begins. Take, for instance, that first sentence from Gabriel García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, the one about the colonel, the firing squad, and the ice. Almost everything we need to know about reading this novel is present in this first sentence. It establishes the main family of the novel and the turbulent times in which they live, as evidenced by the firing squad. It emphasizes the importance of marvels, not in the ice but in the verb “discover,” which suggests how miraculous this substance must have been to the child in, as we shortly discover, a pre-electrified equatorial Colombia. We know what sort of voice is telling the story, how it manages information, what sorts of words it chooses— and plenty more follows in the next two paragraphs. And it’s not just fabulous novels by South American Nobel laureates that accomplish this sort of feat. Robert Parker mysteries, Anita Shreve domestic dramas, Dan Brown thrillers, and this month’s Harlequin romances, as well as classics by Hardy, Hawthorne, and Hemingway, do the same thing: tell us how to go about reading them. They can’t help it, really. Whatever a novel tells us first is information—about who, what, where, when, how, why. About intent. About irony. About what the writer is up to this time. That first page, sometimes the first paragraph, even the first sentence, can give you everything you need to know to read the novel. How? By conveying some or all of the eighteen things the first page can tell you. First pages convey information without half trying, but they’re always trying. Yeah, but…eighteen? I mean, five or six, or even seven, but eighteen? Conservatively. There are probably many other things we can glean from a first page, but here are eighteen beauties.","output":"ممکن است افراد بسیار بیشتری از خواندن پارکر لذت ببرند تا فاکنر، اما همچنان فرآیند یادگیری‌ای وجود دارد که ما هنگام باز کردن کتاب او از طریق آن می‌رویم. تفاوت دیگر بین چیزی که اغلب به عنوان داستان‌های ژانر یا دسته‌بندی شده‌ی ادبیات با نوع ادبیت‌محور است، میزان تغییر از یک داستان به داستان بعدی است. درس‌های پارکر از کتابی به کتاب بعدی خیلی خوب منتقل می‌شوند، بنابراین اگر شما \\"در جستجوی راشل والاس\\" را خوانده‌اید، به خوبی می‌توانید \\"عقاب کتزسکیل\\" را مدیریت کنید. فاکنر، از سوی دیگر، به ندرت دقیقاً یک کار را دو بار تکرار می‌کند، بنابراین در حالی که برخی از استراتژی‌هایی که ما با خواندن \\"صدا و خشم\\" یاد می‌گیریم ممکن است کمک‌مان کند اگر \\"نور در اوت\\" یا \\"ابسالوم، ابسالوم!\\" را باز کنیم، هر کتاب جدید چالش‌های جدید و متفاوتی را ارائه می‌دهد. و ما در صفحه اول تغییرات را متوجه می‌شویم. جایی است که درس جدید شروع می‌شود. برای مثال، آن جمله اول از گابریل گارسیا مارکز در \\"صد سال تنهایی\\"، در مورد سرهنگ، گروه اعدام، و یخ. تقریباً هر چیزی که ما نیاز داریم بدانیم برای خواندن این رمان در این جمله اول وجود دارد. این جمله خانواده اصلی داستان و زمان‌های آشفته‌ای که آنها در آن زندگی می‌کنند را، همانطور که از گروه اعدام مشخص است، برقرار می‌کند. بر اهمیت شگفتی‌ها تأکید می‌کند، نه در یخ بلکه در فعل \\"کشف\\"، که نشان‌دهنده‌ی این است که این ماده باید برای کودکی در کلمبیای استوایی قبل از برق‌دار شدن، معجزه‌آسا بوده‌ است که ما به زودی کشف می‌کنیم. می‌دانیم که چه نوع صدایی داستان را تعریف می‌کند، چگونه اطلاعات را مدیریت می‌کند، از چه نوع کلماتی انتخاب می‌کند — و خیلی چیزهای بیشتری در دو پاراگراف بعدی پیگیری می‌شود. و نه فقط رمان‌های شگفت‌انگیز توسط برندگان جایزه نوبل آمریکای جنوبی این نوع کار را انجام می‌دهند. رمز و رازهای رابرت پارکر، درام‌های خانوادگی آنیتا شِروِو، تریلرهای دن براون، و عاشقانه‌های هارلکوئین این ماه، همچنین کلاسیک‌هایی از هاردی، هاثورن، و همینگوی، همان کار را می‌کنند: به ما یاد می‌دهند چگونه آن‌ها را بخوانیم. واقعاً نمی‌توانند کمکی کنند. هر چیزی که یک رمان برای اولین بار به ما می‌گوید، اطلاعات است — درباره چه کسی، چه چیزی، کجا، کی، چگونه، چرا. درباره قصد. درباره طنز. در مورد اینکه نویسنده این بار چه کاری انجام می‌دهد. آن صفحه اول، گاهی اوقات پاراگراف اول، حتی جمله اول، می‌تواند هر چیزی را که نیاز دارید برای خواندن رمان بدانید به شما بدهد. چگونه؟ با انتقال برخی یا همه ی هجده چیزی که صفحه اول می‌تواند به شما بگوید. صفحات اولیه اطلاعات را بدون نیمه تلاش منتقل می‌کنند، اما همیشه در حال تلاش هستند. بله، اما... هجده؟ منظورم پنج یا شش، یا حتی هفت، اما هجده؟ به طور محافظ‌کارانه. احتمالاً چیزهای زیاد دیگری وجود دارد که می‌توانیم از یک صفحه اول استخراج کنیم، اما اینجا هجده نمونه زیبا وجود دارد."},{"instruction":"translate this to Persian 1. Style. Short or long sentences? Simple or complex? Rushed or leisurely? How many modifiers—adjectives and adverbs and such? The first page of any Hemingway novel will impress us with short declarative sentences and a strong sense that the writer was badly frightened in infancy by words ending in “ly.” Any first page by an American detective novelist—John D. or Ross Macdonald, say, or Raymond Chandler or Mickey Spillane or even Linda Barnes—will convince us that the writer has read Hemingway. In Spillane’s case, with no great comprehension. 2. Tone. Every book has a tone. Is it elegiac, or matter-of-fact, or ironic? That opening from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a man in possession of a fortune must be in want of a wife,” is a tonal masterpiece. It distances the speaker from the source of the “truth” while giving her permission to trot out an ironic statement about wives running through husbands’ fortunes and wealthy men being more desirable than poor ones. “In want of” cuts two ways at least. 3. Mood. Similar to tone but not quite the same. The previous item is about how the voice sounds; this one is about how it feels about what it’s telling. However we describe the tone of The Great Gatsby, the mood of the narration, in Nick Carraway’s person, is one of regret, guilt, and even anger, all of which sneak in between his overly reasonable-sounding statements about mulling over advice from his father and the disparities of privilege. So what is it, we wonder at once, that he’s not quite saying here? 4. Diction. What kinds of words does the novel use? Are they common or rare? Friendly or challenging? Are the sentences whole or fractured, and if the latter, on purpose or accidentally? Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange—which begins with the deceptively simple query, “What’s it going to be, then?”— has the most remarkable diction of any novel I know. His narrator, the barely educated young thug Alex, speaks with an Elizabethan elaboration worthy of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. His insults are colorful and baffling to his adversaries, his descriptions and praise effusive, his curses wonders of invention, and his language shot through with a made-up teen slang, Nadsat, based largely on Slavic words. And we get the first inklings of his linguistic temperament in the novel’s opening passages. This is merely the extreme example; every novel has its own diction, and every word chosen details it further.","output":"۱. سبک. جملات کوتاه یا بلند؟ ساده یا پیچیده؟ عجولانه یا آرام؟ چه تعدادی صفت و قید و چیزهای مشابه؟ صفحه اول هر رمانی از همینگوی ما را تحت تأثیر قرار خواهد داد با جملات اظهاری کوتاه و حس قوی‌ای که نویسنده از کلمات به پسوندهای \\"ly\\" در دوران کودکی شدیداً وحشت داشته است. هر صفحه اولی از یک رمان نویس کارآگاهی آمریکایی - بگویید جان دی. یا راس مک‌دونالد، یا ریموند چندلر یا میکی اسپیلین یا حتی لیندا بارنز - ما را متقاعد می‌کند که نویسنده همینگوی را خوانده است. در مورد اسپیلین، بدون درک زیادی. ۲. لحن. هر کتابی یک لحن دارد. آیا آن عزادارانه، یا واقع‌بینانه، یا طنزآمیز است؟ آن شروع از \\"غرور و تعصب\\" جین آستین، \\"این یک حقیقت به طور عمومی پذیرفته شده است که یک مرد صاحب ثروت باید در حال جستجوی همسر باشد\\"، یک شاهکار تن‌آلی است. این جمله فاصله‌ای بین گوینده و منبع \\"حقیقت\\" ایجاد می‌کند در حالی که به او اجازه می‌دهد بیانیه‌ای طنزآمیز درباره همسرانی که از ثروت شوهران خود می‌گذرند و مردان ثروتمند جذاب‌تر از فقرا هستند، بیان کند. \\"در حال جستجوی\\" حداقل به دو طریق تعبیر می‌شود. ۳. حال و هوا. شبیه به لحن ولی کاملاً یکسان نیست. مورد قبلی درباره چگونگی به نظر رسیدن صدا است؛ این یکی درباره احساس آن نسبت به آنچه دارد بیان می‌کند است. هرچه توصیف لحن \\"گتسبی بزرگ\\" باشد، حال و هوای روایت، در شخصیت نیک کاراوی، یکی از پشیمانی، گناه و حتی خشم است، همه‌ی آن‌ها که بین بیان‌های به ظاهر منطقیِ او درباره تفکر بر روی مشاوره پدرش و تفاوت‌های امتیازات می‌لغزند. پس چیست، ما بلافاصله کنجکاو می‌شویم، که او اینجا به طور کامل نمی‌گوید؟ ۴. کلمات و واژگان. رمان از چه نوع کلماتی استفاده می‌کند؟ آیا آن‌ها معمولی یا نادر هستند؟ دوستانه یا چالش‌برانگیز؟ آیا جملات کامل یا ناقص هستند، و اگر دومی، عمداً یا تصادفی؟ \\"پرتقال کوکی\\" اثر آنتونی برجس - که با پرسش فریبنده ساده \\"پس، قرار است چه شود؟\\" آغاز می‌شود - دارای شگفت‌انگیزترین واژه‌ها و کلمات در هر رمانی است که من می‌شناسم. راوی او، جوان لات و کم سواد به نام الکس، با براعتی که شایسته‌ی شکسپیر و هم‌عصرانش است به زبان الیزابتی صحبت می‌کند. توهین‌های او رنگارنگ و برای دشمنانش مبهم است، توصیفات و ستایش‌های او فراوان، ناسزاهای او شگفتی‌های ابداعی، و زبان او با اسلنگ جوانان ساختگی، نادسات، که عمدتاً بر اساس واژه‌های اسلاوی ساخته شده است، آمیخته شده‌اند. و ما اولین انگیزه‌های خلق خصلت زبانی او را در گذرگاه‌های ابتدایی رمان دریافت می‌کنیم. تنها این یک مثال بسیار زیاده‌روی شده است؛ هر رمان واژگان خود را دارد و هر کلمه‌ای که انتخاب می‌شود، جزئیات آن‌را بیشتر مشخص می‌کند."},{"instruction":"translate this to Persian Point of view. The first issue isn’t who is telling the story in terms of identity. Indeed, for most of the novels we’ll ever read, there is no “who” in that sense. But who relative to the story and its characters—that we can learn straight off. Is this a “ he/she” story or an “I” story? When “I” shows up we expect to meet a character, major or minor, and we immediately have our suspicions aroused. That discussion, however, can wait. If the narrative employs “he” and “she” for persons in the story, with no “I” in sight, we can be fairly safe in assuming this is a more distant, third-person narration. If the narration employs “you,” all bets are off and we head for shelter. Happily, second-person narrations are rare, but they are, like Italo Calvino’s experimental If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler and Tom Robbins’s Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas, very likely to be strange experiences. We can get fooled in all this; as with all literary rules, this one exists to be broken. Sometimes a character-narrator will hide culpability behind a mock third￾person viewpoint, or an outside narrator will employ “I” as a narrative gambit. Even with such tricky business, though, we sometimes get hints in the first paragraphs. 6. Narrative presence. Now we can speak of that other who. Is this voice disembodied or possessed by a personage, inside or outside the story? Is it a servant talking about her masters, a victim talking about his persecutors, a perpetrator speaking of his victims? They often give us hints right away. With first￾person narrators, the “presence” is pretty clear. Hemingway’s Jake Barnes (The Sun Also Rises) and Fredric Henry (A Farewell to Arms) make themselves known right away; their personality imprints itself on the text from sentence one. But what about third-person narrators? In the eighteenth century, narrators were often full of personality, genial companions who, like ourselves (so went the conceit), were men and women of the world, who understood what people were like, who were amused by the foibles of their neighbors. We see such poses in Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones or Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. In the following era, Charles Dickens’s storytelling presence insinuates his way into Our Mutual Friend in the first five words, “In these times of ours,” announcing that the narrator will be a very involved participant in the tale, a passionate observer and commentator. By the time we get to the twentieth century, that third-person narrator is often impersonal, detached, cool, as in Hemingway or Anita Brookner. Compare that Dickens opening to this one you probably read at school: “He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.” This voice is more aloof, less likely to get in there and mix it up emotionally than his Victorian counterpart.","output":"دیدگاه. اولین مسأله در مورد این نیست که چه کسی داستان را از نظر هویت روایت می‌کند. در حقیقت، برای بیشتر رمان‌هایی که ما تا به حال خوانده‌ایم، \\"چه کسی\\" به آن معنا وجود ندارد. اما \\"چه کسی\\" نسبت به داستان و شخصیت‌های آن - آن را می‌توانیم مستقیم یاد بگیریم. آیا این داستانی با \\"او\\" است یا \\"من\\"؟ وقتی \\"من\\" ظاهر می‌شود انتظار داریم با یک شخصیت، چه مهم و چه جزئی، ملاقات کنیم و بلافاصله مشکوک می‌شویم. این بحث، با این حال، می‌تواند صبر کند. اگر داستان از \\"او\\" برای اشخاص در داستان استفاده کند، بدون \\"من\\" در میدان دید، ما می‌توانیم به طور نسبتاً امن فرض کنیم که این یک روایت شخص سوم و دورتر است. اگر داستان از \\"تو\\" استفاده کند، همه شرط‌ها برداشته می‌شوند و ما به پناهگاه می‌رویم. خوشبختانه، روایت‌های شخص دوم نادر هستند، اما آن‌ها، مانند \\"اگر در شب زمستانی یک مسافر\\" تجربی ایتالو کالوینو و \\"نیمه‌خواب در پیژامه‌های قورباغه‌ای\\" تام رابینز، بسیار احتمالاً تجربیات عجیب و غریبی خواهند بود. ما می‌توانیم در این همه گمراه شویم؛ همانطور که با تمام قوانین ادبی، این یکی برای شکستن وجود دارد. گاهی اوقات یک شخصیت-راوی مسئولیت‌پذیری را پشت یک نقطه نظر سوم شخصی-جعلی مخفی می‌کند، یا یک راوی خارجی از \\"من\\" به عنوان یک حرکت داستانی استفاده می‌کند. حتی با این کارهای پیچیده، گاهی اوقات ما در پاراگراف‌های اول نکته‌سنجی‌ها را می‌گیریم. ۶. حضور روایی. حالا ما می‌توانیم در مورد آن \\"چه کسی\\" دیگر صحبت کنیم. آیا این صدا بدون بدن است یا توسط یک شخصیت تسخیر شده، درون یا بیرون داستان؟ آیا خادمی است که در مورد اربابان خود حرف می‌زند، قربانی‌ای که در مورد آزارگران خود حرف می‌زند، یا عاملی که در مورد قربانیان خود صحبت می‌کند؟ آن‌ها اغلب از همان ابتدا برای ما نکاتی می‌دهند. با راویان شخص اول، \\"حضور\\" به وضوح مشخص است. جیک بارنز همینگوی (خورشید همچنین طلوع می‌کند) و فردریک هنری (وداع با اسلحه) خودشان را به سرعت نشان می‌دهند؛ شخصیت آن‌ها از جمله اول بر متن تأثیر می‌گذارد. اما در مورد راویان شخص سوم چطور؟ در قرن هجدهم، راویان اغلب پر از شخصیت بودند، همراه‌های خوش‌بینی که، مانند خودمان (به این تظاهر)، مردان و زنانی از دنیا بودند که می‌فهمیدند مردم چگونه هستند، که از خرده‌کاری‌های همسایگان‌شان خوشحال بودند. ما چنین پوزهایی را در \\"تام جونز\\" هنری فیلدینگ یا \\"غرور و تعصب\\" آستن می‌بینیم. در دوره‌ی بعدی، حضور روایی چارلز دیکنز به آرامی راه خود را در \\"دوست متقابل ما\\" در پنج کلمه اول، \\"در این زمان‌های ما\\"، باز می‌کند، اعلام می‌کند که راوی شرکت‌کننده‌ای بسیار درگیر در داستان خواهد بود، مشاهده‌گر و نظردهنده‌ی پرشور. در زمانی که ما به قرن بیستم می‌رسیم، آن راوی شخص سوم اغلب بی‌طرف، جدا افتاده، خنک است، مانند همینگوی یا آنیتا بروکنر. این شروع دیکنز را با این که احتمالاً در مدرسه خوانده‌اید مقایسه کنید: \\"او مرد پیری بود که تنها در یک ته قایق در جریان خلیج و صید ماهی می‌کرد و حالا هشتاد و چهار روز بود که یک ماهی صید نکرده بود\\". این صدا دورتر، کمتر احتمال دارد نسبت به همتای ویکتوریایی خود احساسی شود و در آن مخلوط شود."},{"instruction":"translate this to Persian Narrative attitude toward characters and events. How does the narrator feel about the people and action in the novel? Austen’s narrators are generally amused, slightly aloof, a little superior. Dickens’s tend to be earnest, involved, direct (if third-person); naïve, earnest, fond (if first-person). Flaubert’s narrator in Madame Bovary is famously cool and impersonal, largely in reaction to the overheated involvement of narrators in the previous romantic era. In rejecting the extant cliché, Flaubert created the narrative cliché that would predominate for much of the next century. 8. Time frame. When is all this happening? Contemporaneously or a long time ago? How can we tell? Does the novel cover a lot of time or a little? In what part of the narrator’s life, if she’s a character? That “many years later” of the García Márquez opening is magical. It says, first of all, that this novel will cover a great deal of time, enough for a small child holding his father’s hand to rise to power and fall from it. But it also says something else magical: “once upon a time.” This is a kind of fairy tale, it says, about an exotic place and time, neither of which exists anymore (nowhere can be that backward, he hints), that were special in their own time. Any novelist who isn’t jealous about those three words alone isn’t very serious about craft. 9. Time management. Will time go fast or slow in this novel? Is it being told in or near the now of the story or long after? Nicholson Baker’s little gem, The Mezzanine takes place—all of it—during the time it takes its narrator to ride an escalator from the first floor to the aforementioned destination. In order to pull off that stunt, the writer must elongate time to the extreme, relying on flashbacks and digressions, and that strategy shows up right away, as it must. 10. Place. Okay, setting, but also more than mere setting. Place is a sense of things, a mode of thought, a way of seeing. Take that T. C. Boyle opening I quote above. In the second paragraph, we learn that Mungo Park, a Scotsman, is an explorer looking for the Niger River who has taken a serious wrong turn. Place here is both locale and story. This—the tent, the continent, the country—is where he is, to be sure. But this is also where he’s an outsider, the leading edge of nascent imperial intentions, and a blunderer who keeps finding himself in variations of his current humiliating situation. In that sense, place, the immediate place, becomes motif: time after time we will see Mungo blunder into disastrous situations through total ignorance of the nature, culture, and geography—in other words, of place. Which leads us to… 11. Motif. Stuff that happens again and again. Sorry about the technical jargon, but that’s what it is. Motif can be image, action, language pattern, anything that happens again and again. Like Mungo and his recurrent disasters based on cultural arrogance. Like miracles and the colonel’s narrow escapes in One Hundred Years of Solitude. Like the flowers in Mrs. Dalloway. 12. Theme. Stop groaning—there won’t be a test. Theme is the bane of all tenth-grade English students, but it’s also about, well, aboutness. Story is what gets a novel going and what we focus on, but theme is one of the things that makes it worthwhile. Theme is, roughly speaking, the idea content of the novel. Sometimes that content is simple: most mysteries share the theme that crime will be found out, that no one gets away with it, that order will prevail. Often, it’s more subtle than that. Agatha Christie often has a secondary theme concerning the decadence of the aristocracy. Ever notice with her how many bad eggs there are in manor houses? Or how inept, corrupt, or stupid they are? Think that’s accidental? Sometimes theme overlaps with motif, as those recurrences serve to reinforce a key idea. One of Mrs. Dalloway’s main ideas, the presence of the past, shows up on the first page, as Clarissa’s plunge into the beautiful June day in 1923 launches her back to a similar day when she was eighteen. Throughout the novel, those old days keep showing up in the form of memories and persons, and it all starts right away.","output":"نگرش راوی نسبت به شخصیت‌ها و وقایع. راوی چگونه نسبت به مردم و فعالیت‌ها در رمان احساس دارد؟ راوی‌های آستن به طور کلی سرگرم‌کننده، کمی دور از دسترس و کمی برتر هستند. راوی‌های دیکنز معمولاً صادقانه، مشغول و مستقیم هستند (اگر شخص سوم باشند)؛ ساده‌لوح، مشتاق و دوست‌دار (اگر شخص اول باشند). راوی \\"مادام بواری\\" فلوبر به صورت معروف بی‌طرف و شخصی‌زدایی شده است، بیشتر در واکنش به دخالت زیاد راوی‌ها در دوره‌ عاشقانه‌ قبل. به هنگام رد کلیشه‌های موجود، فلوبر کلیشه روایی را خلق کرد که برای بسیاری از قرن بعد غالب می‌شد. ۸. چارچوب زمانی. تمام این‌ها چه زمانی اتفاق می‌افتند؟ آیا به طور هم‌زمان یا خیلی وقت پیش؟ چطور می‌توانیم متوجه شویم؟ آیا رمان زمان زیادی را پوشش می‌دهد یا کم؟ در کدام بخش از زندگی راوی، اگر او شخصیت اصلی باشد؟ آن \\"سال‌های سال بعد\\" از شروع کار گابریل گارسیا مارکز جادویی است. اول از همه می‌گوید این رمان دوران بسیار طولانی را پوشش خواهد داد، کافی برای اینکه یک کودک کوچک در حالی که دست پدرش را گرفته، به قدرت برسد و از آن سقوط کند. اما همچنین چیز دیگری جادویی می‌گوید: \\"روزی روزگاری.\\" این یک نوع داستان پریانی است، می‌گوید، در مورد یک مکان و زمان عجیب، که هیچکدام دیگر وجود ندارند (دیگر هیچ جا نمی‌تواند به این اندازه عقب‌افتاده باشد، او نشانه می‌دهد)، که در زمان خود ویژه بودند. هر نویسنده‌ای که در مورد آن سه کلمه تنها حسادت نکند، خیلی جدی در مورد هنر و کار خود نیست. ۹. مدیریت زمان. زمان در این رمان سریع خواهد گذشت یا آهسته؟ آیا در زمان حال داستان گفته می‌شود یا پس از مدت زمان زیادی؟ یک کار کوچک از نیکولسون بیکر، \\"مزانین\\" در مدت زمانی اتفاق می‌افتد - تمام آن - که طول می‌کشد راوی با یک پله‌برقی از طبقه اول به مقصد مذکور برود. برای انجام این کار، نویسنده باید زمان را به حدی افراطی طولانی کند، با تکیه بر برگشت به گذشته و انحرافات، و این استراتژی بلافاصله ظاهر می‌شود، همانطور که باید باشد. ۱۰. مکان. خوب، تنظیم، اما همچنین بیش از یک تنظیم ساده. مکان یک حس از چیزها، یک نوع تفکر، یک روش دیدن است. آن شروع کار تی. سی. بویلی که من قبلاً نقل کردم بردارید. در پاراگراف دوم، ما یاد می‌گیریم که مونجو پارک، یک اسکاتلندی، کاوشگری است که به دنبال رود نایجر است که جدی اشتباه کرده است. مکان در اینجا هم موقعیت و هم داستان است. این - چادر، قاره، کشور - مکانی است که او قطعاً است، بی‌شک. اما این همچنین جایی است که او یک بیگانه است، لبه‌ی پیشتاز قصدهای نوظهور امپریالیستی، و یک اشتباه‌کاری که خودش را دائماً در نوعی از وضعیت‌های حقارت‌آمیز کنونی پیدا می‌کند. در آن معنا، مکان، مکان فوری، تبدیل به یک موتیف می‌شود: بارها و بارها ما خواهیم دید که مونجو به دلیل جهل کامل نسبت به طبیعت، فرهنگ، و جغرافیا - به عبارت دیگر، به دلیل جهل به مکان - وارد وضعیت‌های فاجعه‌آمیز می‌شود. که ما را به سوی... ۱۱. موتیف. مسائلی که بارها و بارها اتفاق می‌افتند. متأسفم برای اصطلاح‌های فنی، اما این همان چیزی است. موتیف می‌تواند تصویر، عمل، الگوی زبان و هر چیزی که دوباره و دوباره اتفاق بیفتد، باشد. مانند مونجو و فاجعه‌های دائمی او بر اساس خودبزرگ‌بینی فرهنگی. مثل معجزه‌ها و فرارهای باریک کرنل در \\"صد سال تنهایی.\\" مثل گل‌ها در \\"خانم دالوی.\\" ۱۲. موضوع. از ناله کردن دست بردارید - امتحانی در کار نخواهد بود. موضوع بلای جان تمام دانش‌آموزان انگلیسی پایه دهم است، اما همچنین در مورد خلاصه موضوع است. داستان چیزی است که رمان را راه می‌اندازد و چیزی است که ما روی آن تمرکز داریم، اما موضوع یکی از چیزهایی است که باعث می‌شود ارزش داشته باشد. به طور تقریبی موضوع، محتوای ایده‌ای رمان است. گاهی اوقات این محتوا ساده است: بیشتر رمان‌های جنایی موضوع مشترکی دارند که جرم کشف خواهد شد، که هیچ کسی با آن فرار نخواهد کرد، که نظم برقرار خواهد شد. اغلب، از آن پیچیده‌تر است. آگاتا کریستی اغلب یک موضوع فرعی دارد که به انحطاط اشرافیت اشاره دارد. تاکنون متوجه شده‌اید که چه تعداد بدمن در خانه‌های اشرافی او هستند؟ یا چقدر ناشایست، فاسد یا احمق هستند؟ فکر می‌کنید اتفاقی‌اند؟ گاهی اوقات موضوع با موتیف همپوشانی دارد، زیرا این تکرارها به تقویت یک ایده کلیدی کمک می‌کنند. یکی از ایده‌های اصلی \\"خانم دالوی\\"، حضور گذشته، در صفحه اول ظاهر می‌شود، زیرا شیرجه کلاریسا به روز زیبای ژوئن در سال ۱۹۲۳ او را به روز مشابهی برمی‌گرداند که او هیجده سال داشت. در طول رمان، این روزهای قدیمی به شکل خاطرات و شخصیت‌ها ظاهر می‌شوند، و همه این‌ها از همان ابتدا شروع می‌شود."},{"instruction":"translate this to Persian Irony. Or not—some novels are in dead earnest. The entire nineteenth century springs to mind. Okay, maybe not Mark Twain. Oh, and Gustave Flaubert. But you know what I mean. Others are ironic on any number of levels—verbal, dramatic, comic, situational—and often that shows up right away. This is one of Parker’s Spenser novels, A Catskill Eagle, getting rolling: “It was midnight and I was just getting home from detecting. I had followed an embezzler around on a warm day in early summer trying to observe him spending his ill-gotten gain. The best I’d been able to do was catch him eating a veal cutlet in a sub shop in Danvers Square across from the Security National Bank. It wasn’t much, but it was as close as you could get to sin in Danvers.” Now Spenser is utterly earnest about what he does when he’s doing it; he never expresses doubt or irony while shooting someone, for instance, but he’s plenty ironic when he talks about it. He knows that his chosen trade, “professional thug” as he calls it in another book, is morally dubious. And that awareness makes its way into the books in phrases like “getting home from detecting.” He may, moreover, want to distance his “real” or “private” self from the actions of his professional self: “I’m the sensitive lover and excellent cook who likes wine with dinner and not merely the hired tough guy who threatens and shoots people,” he seems to say with this strategy. And he also knows full well that you can find plenty of sin in Danvers or any other sleepy burg; that’s just frustration talking. Throughout the novel, then, he’ll veer between hard-charging action—lots of bodies fall in this one— and ironic, distanced commentary. 14. Rhythm. Of one sort. There are two levels of rhythm in a novel: prose and narrative. Narrative rhythm will take a while to establish, but the prose starts showing up at once. Better, it often suggests how the larger narrative’s rhythm will work. Rhythm is related to diction, which we discussed earlier, but with this difference: diction has to do with the words a writer uses, rhythm with how they’re deployed in sentences. In practice, they’re largely inseparable, as prose rhythm depends a good deal on the words chosen while also coloring how those words sound.

When we talk about regression, we often end up discussing Linear and Logistic Regression, as they are the most popular of the 7 types of regressions. In this article, we’ll focus on Ridge and Lasso regression, which are powerful techniques generally used for creating parsimonious models in the presence of a ‘large’ number of features. Here ‘large’ can typically mean either of two things: 1. Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting) 2. Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in the case of millions or billions of features. Though Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. If you’ve heard of them before, you must know that they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features and minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called ‘regularization’ techniques. Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). Regularization Techniques The key difference is in how they assign penalties to the coefficients: 1. Ridge Regression: 1. Performs L2 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of square of coefficients) 2. Lasso Regression: 1. Performs L1 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the absolute value ofthe magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of the absolute value of coefficients) Here, LS Obj refers to the ‘least squares objective,’ i.e., the linear regression objective without regularization. If terms like ‘penalty’ and ‘regularization’ seem very unfamiliar to you, don’t worry; we’ll discuss these in more detail throughout this article. Before digging further into how they work, let’s try to understand why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should work in the first place. Why Penalize the Magnitude of Coefficients? Let’s try to understand the impact of model complexity on the magnitude of coefficients. As an example, I have simulated a sine curve (between 60° and 300°) and added some random noise using the following code: Python Code @shivanshkausha/Ridge_and_Lasso_Regression_jan-28-2016 A Nix repl by shivanshkausha Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 34 SH This resembles a sine curve but not exactly because of the noise. We’ll use this as an example to test different scenarios in this article. Let’s try to estimate the sine function using polynomial regression with powers of x from 1 to 15. Let’s add a column for each power upto 15 in our dataframe. This can be accomplished using the following code: Add a Column for Each Power upto 15 for i in range(2,16): #power of 1 is already there colname = 'x_%d'%i #new var will be x_power data[colname] = data['x']**i print(data.head())add a column for each power upto 15 The dataframe looks like this: Making 15 Different Linear Regression Models Now that we have all the 15 powers, let’s make 15 different linear regression models, with each model containing variables with powers of x from 1 to the particular model number. For example, the feature set of model 8 will be – {x, x_2, x_3, …, x_8}. First, we’ll define a generic function that takes in the required maximum power of x as an input and returns a list containing – [ model RSS, intercept, coef_x, coef_x2, … upto entered power ]. Here RSS refers to the ‘Residual Sum of Squares,’ which is nothing but the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values in the training data set and is known as the cost function or the loss function. The python code defining the function is: #Import Linear Regression model from scikit-learn. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression def linear_regression(data, power, models_to_plot): #initialize predictors: predictors=['x'] if power>=2: predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,power+1)]) #Fit the model linreg = LinearRegression(normalize=True) linreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = linreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered power if power in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[power]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for power: %d'%power) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([linreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(linreg.coef_) return ret Note that this function will not plot the model fit for all the powers but will return the RSS and coefficient values for all the models. I’ll skip the details of the code for now to maintain brevity. I’ll be happy to discuss the same through the comments below if required. Store allthe Results in Pandas Dataframe Now, we can make all 15 models and compare the results. For ease of analysis, we’ll store all the results in a Pandas dataframe and plot 6 models to get an idea of the trend. Consider the following code: #Initialize a dataframe to store the results: col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['model_pow_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] coef_matrix_simple = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the powers for which a plot is required: models_to_plot = {1:231,3:232,6:233,9:234,12:235,15:236} #Iterate through all powers and assimilate results for i in range(1,16): coef_matrix_simple.iloc[i-1,0:i+2] = linear_regression(data, power=i, models_to_plot=models_to_plot) We would expect the models with increasing complexity to better fit the data and result in lower RSS values. This can be verified by looking at the plots generated for 6 models: This clearly aligns with our initial understanding. As the model complexity increases, the models tend to fit even smaller deviations in the training data set. Though this leads to overfitting, let’s keep this issue aside for some time and come to our main objective, i.e., the impact on the magnitude of coefficients. This can be analyzed by looking at the data frame created above. Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_simple The output looks like this: It is clearly evident that the size of coefficients increases exponentially with an increase in model complexity. I hope this gives some intuition into why putting a constraint on the magnitude of coefficients can be a good idea to reduce model complexity. Let’s try to understand this even better. What does a large coefficient signify? It means that we’re putting a lot of emphasis on that feature, i.e., the particular feature is a good predictor for the outcome. When it becomes too large, the algorithm starts modeling intricate relations to estimate the output and ends up overfitting the particular training data. I hope the concept is clear. Now, let’s understand ridge and lasso regression in detail and see how well they work for the same problem. How Does Ridge Regression Work? As mentioned before, ridge regression performs ‘L2 regularization‘, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of squares of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, ridge regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe square of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) is the parameter that balances the amount of emphasis given to minimizing RSS vs minimizing the sum of squares of coefficients. α can take various values: 1. α = 0: 1. The objective becomes the same as simple linear regression. 2. We’ll get the same coefficients as simple linear regression. 2. α = ∞: 1. The coefficients will be zero. Why? Because of infinite weightage on the square of coefficients, anything less than zero will make the objective infinite. 3. 0 < α < ∞: 1. The magnitude of α will decide the weightage given to different parts of the objective. 2. The coefficients will be somewhere between 0 and ones for simple linear regression. I hope this gives some sense of how α would impact the magnitude of coefficients. One thing is for sure – any non-zero value would give values less than that of simple linear regression. By how much? We’ll find out soon. Leaving the mathematical details for later, let’s see ridge regression in action on the same problem as above. Function for Ridge Regression First, let’s define a generic function for ridge regression similar to the one defined for simple linear regression. The Python code is: from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge def ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model ridgereg = Ridge(alpha=alpha,normalize=True) ridgereg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = ridgereg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([ridgereg.intercept_]) ret.extend(ridgereg.coef_) return ret Note the ‘Ridge’ function used here. It takes ‘alpha’ as a parameter on initialization. Also, keep in mind that normalizing the inputs is generally a good idea in every type of regression and should be used in the case of ridge regression as well. Now, let’s analyze the result of Ridge regression for 10 different values of α ranging from 1e-15 to 20. These values have been chosen so that we can easily analyze the trend with changes in values of α. These would, however, differ from case to case. Note that each of these 10 models will contain all the 15 variables, and only the value of alpha would differ. This differs from the simple linear regression case, where each model had a subset of features. Python Code #Initialize predictors to be set of 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Set the different values of alpha to be tested alpha_ridge = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10, 20] #Initialize the dataframe for storing coefficients. col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_ridge[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_ridge = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) models_to_plot = {1e-15:231, 1e-10:232, 1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 5:236} for i in range(10): coef_matrix_ridge.iloc[i,] = ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha_ridge[i], models_to_plot) This would generate the following plot: Here we can clearly observe that as the value of alpha increases, the model complexity reduces. Though higher values of alpha reduce overfitting, significantly high values can cause underfitting as well (e.g., alpha = 5). Thus alpha should be chosen wisely. A widely accepted technique is cross-validation, i.e., the value of alpha is iterated over a range of values, and the one giving a higher cross-validation score is chosen. Let’s have a look at the value of coefficients in the above models: Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_ridge The table looks like: This straight away gives us the following inferences: 1. The RSS increases with an increase in alpha. 2. An alpha value as small as 1e-15 gives us a significant reduction in the magnitude of coefficients. How? Compare the coefficients in the first row of this table to the last row of the simple linear regression table. 3. High alpha values can lead to significant underfitting. Note the rapid increase in RSS for values of alpha greater than 1 4. Though the coefficients are really small, they are NOT zero. The first 3 are very intuitive. But #4 is also a crucial observation. Let’s reconfirm the same by determining the number of zeros in each row of the coefficients data set: Python Code coef_matrix_ridge.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: This confirms that all 15 coefficients are greater than zero in magnitude (can be +ve or -ve). Remember this observation and have a look again until it’s clear. This will play an important role later while comparing ridge with lasso regression. How Does Lasso Regression Work? LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I know it doesn’t give much of an idea, but there are 2 keywords here – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection. ‘ Let’s consider the former first and worry about the latter later. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of the absolute value of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, lasso regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe absolute value of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) works similar to that of the ridge and provides a trade-off between balancing RSS and the magnitude of coefficients. Like that of the ridge, α can take various values. Let’s iterate it here briefly: 1. α = 0: Same coefficients as simple linear regression 2. α = ∞: All coefficients zero (same logic as before) 3. 0 < α < ∞: coefficients between 0 and that of simple linear regression Defining Generic Function Yes, its appearing to be very similar to Ridge till now. But hang on with me, and you’ll know the difference by the time we finish. Like before, let’s run lasso regression on the same problem as above. First, we’ll define a generic function: from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso def lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model lassoreg = Lasso(alpha=alpha,normalize=True, max_iter=1e5) lassoreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = lassoreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([lassoreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(lassoreg.coef_) return ret Notice the additional parameters defined in the Lasso function – ‘max_iter. ‘ This is the maximum number of iterations for which we want the model to run if it doesn’t converge before. This exists for Ridge as well, but setting this to a higher than default value was required in this case. Why?I’ll come to this in the next section. Different Values of Alpha Let’s check the output for 10 different values of alpha using the following code: #Initialize predictors to all 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Define the alpha values to test alpha_lasso = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-5,1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10] #Initialize the dataframe to store coefficients col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_lasso[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_lasso = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the models to plot models_to_plot = {1e-10:231, 1e-5:232,1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 1:236} #Iterate over the 10 alpha values: for i in range(10): coef_matrix_lasso.iloc[i,] = lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha_lasso[i], models_to_plot) This gives us the following plots: This again tells us that the model complexity decreases with an increase in the values of alpha. But notice the straight line at alpha=1. Appears a bit strange to me. Let’s explore this further by looking at the coefficients: Apart from the expected inference of higher RSS for higher alphas, we can see the following: 1. For the same values of alpha, the coefficients of lasso regression are much smaller than that of ridge regression (compare row 1 of the 2 tables). 2. For the same alpha, lasso has higher RSS (poorer fit) as compared to ridge regression. 3. Many of the coefficients are zero, even for very small values of alpha. Inferences #1 and 2 might not always generalize but will hold for many cases. The real difference from the ridge is coming out in the last inference. Let’s check the number of coefficients that are zero in each model using the following code: coef_matrix_lasso.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: We can observe that even for a small value of alpha, a significant number of coefficients are zero. This also explains the horizontal line fit for alpha=1 in the lasso plots; it’s just a baseline model! This phenomenon of most of the coefficients being zero is called ‘sparsity. ‘ Although lasso performs feature selection, this level of sparsity is achieved in special cases only, which we’ll discuss towards the end. This has some really interesting implications on the use cases of lasso regression as compared to that of ridge regression. But before coming to the final comparison, let’s take a bird’s eye view of the mathematics behind why coefficients are zero in the case of lasso but not ridge. Python Code @LakshayArora1/Regularisation - Big Mart Sales A Python repl by LakshayArora1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 8 LA Some Underlying Mathematical Principles Here’s a sneak peek into some of the underlying mathematical principles of regression. If you wish to get into the details, I recommend taking a good statistics textbook, like Elements of Statistical Learning. Let’s start by reviewing the basic structure of data in a regression problem. In this infographic, you can see there are 4 data elements: 1. X: the matrix of input features (nrow: N, ncol: M+1) 2. Y: the actual outcome variable (length:N) 3. Yhat: these are predicted values of Y (length:N) 4. W: the weights or the coefficients (length: M+1) Here, N is the total number of data points available, and M is the total number of features. X has M+1 columns because of M features and 1 intercept. The predicted outcome for any data point i is: It is simply the weighted sum of each data point with coefficients as the weights. This prediction is achieved by finding the optimum value of weights based on certain criteria, which depends on the type of regression algorithm being used. Let’s consider all 3 cases: Simple Linear Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is just the RSS (Residual Sum of Squares), i.e., the sum of squared errors of the predicted outcome as compared to the actual outcome. This can be depicted mathematically as: In order to minimize this cost, we generally use a ‘gradient descent’ algorithm. The overall algorithm works like this: 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 determine the gradient 2.1.2 update the jth weight by subtracting learning rate times the gradient w(t+1) = w(t) - learning rate * gradient Here the important step is #2.1.1, where we compute the gradient. A gradient is nothing but a partial differential of the cost with respect to a particular weight (denoted as wj). The gradient for the jth weight will be: This is formed from 2 parts: 1. 2*{..}: This is formed because we’ve differentiated the square of the term in {..} 2. -wj: This is the differentiation of the part in {..} wrt wj. Since it’s a summation, all others would become 0, and only wj would remain. Step #2.1.2 involves updating the weights using the gradient. This updating step for simple linear regression looks like this: Note the +ve sign in the RHS is formed after the multiplication of 2 -ve signs. I would like to explain point #2 of the gradient descent algorithm mentioned above, ‘iterate till not converged.‘ Here convergence refers to attaining the optimum solution within the pre-defined limit. It is checked using the value of the gradient. If the gradient is small enough, it means we are very close to the optimum, and further iterations won’t substantially impact the coefficients. The lower limit on the gradient can be changed using the ‘tol‘ parameter. Let’s consider the case of ridge regression now. Ridge Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of squares of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient would be: Again in the regularization part of a gradient, only w remains, and all others would become zero. The corresponding update rule is: j Here we can see that the second part of the RHS is the same as that of simple linear regression. Thus, ridge regression is equivalent to reducing the weight by a factor of (1-2λη) first and then applying the same update rule as simple linear regression. I hope this explains why the coefficients get reduced to small numbers but never become zero. Note that the criteria for convergence, in this case, remains similar to simple linear regression, i.e., checking the value of gradients. Let’s discuss Lasso regression now. Lasso Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of the absolute value of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient is not defined as the absolute function is not differentiable at x=0. This can be illustrated as: We can see that the parts on the left and right sides of 0 are straight lines with defined derivates, but the function can’t be differentiated at x=0. In this case, we have to use a different technique called coordinate descent, which is based on the concept of sub-gradients. One of the coordinate descent follows the following algorithms (this is also the default in sklearn): 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 update the jth weight with a value which minimizes the cost #2.1.1 might look too generalized. But I’m intentionally leaving the details and jumping to the update rule: Difference Between Actual and Predicted Outcome Here g(w-j) represents (but not exactly) the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome considering all EXCEPT the jth variable. If this value is small, it means that the algorithm is able to predict the outcome fairly well even without the jth variable, and thus it can be removed from the equation by setting a zero coefficient. This gives us some intuition into why the coefficients become zero in the case of lasso regression. In coordinate descent, checking convergence is another issue. Since gradients are not defined, we need an alternate method. Many alternatives exist, but the simplest one is to check the step size of the algorithm. We can check the maximum difference in weights in any particular cycle overall feature weights (#2.1 of the algorithm above). If this is lower than the specified ‘tol,’ the algorithm will stop. The convergence is not as fast as the gradient descent. If a warning appears saying that the algorithm stopped before convergence, we might have to set the ‘max_iter’ parameter. This is why I specified this parameter in the Lasso generic function. Let’s summarize our understanding by comparing the coefficients in all the three cases using the following visual, which shows how the ridge and lasso coefficients behave in comparison to the simple linear regression case. Reinforced Facts Apologies for the lack of visual appeal. But I think it is good enough to re-inforced the following facts: 1. The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and thus never attain zero values but very small values. 2. The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge. Before going further, one important issue in the case of both ridge and lasso regression is intercept handling. Generally, regularizing the intercept is not a good idea and should be left out of regularization. This requires slight changes in the implementation, which I’ll leave you to explore. Comparison Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression Now that we have a fair idea of how ridge and lasso regression work, let’s try to consolidate our understanding by comparing them and appreciating their specific use cases. I will also compare them with some alternate approaches. Let’s analyze these under three buckets: Key Difference Ridge: It includes all (or none) of the features in the model. Thus, the major advantage of ridge regression is coefficient shrinkage and reducing model complexity. Lasso: Along with shrinking coefficients, the lasso also performs feature selection. (Remember the ‘selection‘ in the lasso full-form?) As we observed earlier, some of the coefficients become exactly zero, which is equivalent to the particular feature being excluded from the model. Traditionally, techniques like stepwise regression were used to perform feature selection and make parsimonious models. But with advancements in Machine-Learning, ridge and lasso regressions provide very good alternatives as they give much better output, require fewer tuning parameters, and can be automated to a large extent. Typical Use Cases Ridge: It is majorly used to prevent overfitting. Since it includes all the features, it is not very useful in the case of exorbitantly high #features, say in millions, as it will pose computational challenges. Lasso: Since it provides sparse solutions, it is generally the model of choice (or some variant of this concept) for modeling cases where the #features are in millions or more. In such a case, getting a sparse solution is of great computational advantage as the features with zero coefficients can be ignored. It’s not hard to see why the stepwise selection techniques become practically cumbersome to implement in highdimensionality cases. Thus, the lasso provides a significant advantage. Presence of Highly Correlated Features Ridge: It generally works well even in the presence of highly correlated features, as it will include all of them in the model. Still, the coefficients will be distributed among them depending on the correlation. Lasso: It arbitrarily selects any feature among the highly correlated ones and reduces the coefficients of the rest to zero. Also, the chosen variable changes randomly with changes in model parameters. This generally doesn’t work that well as compared to ridge regression. This disadvantage of the lasso can be observed in the example we discussed above. Since we used a polynomial regression, the variables were highly correlated. (Not sure why? Check the output of data.corr() ). Thus, we saw that even small values of alpha were giving significant sparsity (i.e., high #coefficients as zero). Along with Ridge and Lasso, Elastic Net is another useful technique that combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It can be used to balance out the pros and cons of ridge and lasso regression. I encourage you to explore it further. Conclusion In this article, we got an overview of regularization using ridge and lasso regression. We then found out why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should give us parsimonious models. Next, we went into details of ridge and lasso regression and saw their advantages over simple linear regression. We also understood how and why they should work. We also peeked into the mathematical part of the regressions. Regularization techniques are really useful, and I encourage you to implement them. If you’re ready to take the challenge, you must try them on the BigMart Sales Prediction problem discussed at the beginning of this article. Key Takeaways Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In Python, scikit-learn provides easy-to-use functions for implementing Ridge and Lasso regression with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity in the input data by reducing the impact of correlated features on the coefficients, while Lasso regression automatically selects the most important features for prediction. Frequently Asked Questions Q1. Whatis ridge and lasso regression? A. Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques in machine learning. Ridge adds L2 regularization, and Lasso adds L1 to linear regression models, preventing overfitting. Q2. When to use ridge regression and when to use lasso regression? A. Use Ridge when you have many correlated predictors and want to avoid multicollinearity. Use Lasso when feature selection is crucial or when you want a sparse model. 54 thoughts on \\"Ridge and Lasso Regression in Python | Complete Tutorial (Updated 2023)\\" Nilabhra Roy Chowdhury says: January 28, 2016 at 8:26 pm Good read, liked the way you explained why weight constraining is essential for regularization. Can you also perform the same experiments on Elastic Net and update this blog? Reply Q3. Whatis the difference between ridge regression and lasso bias? A. Ridge Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, while Lasso adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which can lead to variable selection. Q4. Why do we use ridge and lasso? A. Ridge and Lasso are used to prevent overfitting in regression models by adding regularization terms to the cost function, encouraging simpler models with fewer predictors and more generalizability. cost function Elastic Net L1 regularization L2 regularization lasso regression linear regression live coding logistic regression overfitting penalizing coefficients regression regression coefficients regularization Residual sum of squares ridge regression total sum of squares Aboutthe Author Aarshay Jain Aarshay graduated from MS in Data Science at Columbia University in 2017 and is currently an ML Engineer at Spotify New York.

Всё удобрения осенью и весной я уже внёс. Теперь я планирую внести фосфорные удобрения при посадки картошки. Нормально ли будет внести за раз удобрение, содержащее 70 кг действующего вещества","output":"Внесение фосфорных удобрений является важной частью подготовки почвы к посадке картошки, так как фосфор способствует лучшему развитию корневой системы, а также улучшает качество и урожайность картофеля. Однако точную дозировку внесения следует рассчитать на основе множества факторов, включая плодородие почвы, предшествующие урожаи, внесение органических и других минеральных удобрений, а также сорт картофеля. Как правило, норма внесения фосфорных удобрений рассчитывается в килограммах действующего вещества на гектар. Если вы упоминаете 70 кг действующего вещества, предположим, что это количество предназначено для использования на один гектар. Но если участок меньше, то такая доза может быть излишней и даже вредной для растений и почвы. Фосфорные удобрения часто применяют в виде суперфосфата или других комплексных удобрений, содержащих фосфор. Например, если вы используете суперфосфат с содержанием действующего вещества P2O5 около 20%, то для получения 70 кг действующего вещества потребуется 350 кг суперфосфата (70 / 0.20). Также важно учитывать предыдущие внесенные удобрения, чтобы не перенасытить почву фосфором, что может привести к экологическим проблемам и нарушению питания растений. Прежде чем вносить фосфорные удобрения, рекомендуется провести анализ почвы на содержание фосфора, чтобы точнее определить необходимые дозы. Кроме того, стоит следовать рекомендациям производителя удобрения и агрономическим нормам для вашего региона. Если вы не уверены в точной дозировке, лучше проконсультироваться с агрономом или специалистом в этой области, который поможет вам определить оптимальное количество фосфорного удобрения для вашего конкретного участка и сельскохозяйственной практики."},{"instruction":"По расчётом эксперта нужно внести 70 кг действующего вещества фосфора на га. Можно ли такую дозу внести за раз при посадке или её нужно разбивать?","output":"Внесение фосфора может осуществляться как осенью, так и весной. Фосфорные удобрения отличаются медленной подвижностью в почве по сравнению с азотными и калийными удобрениями, и вносить их можно как однократно под основную обработку почвы, так и частично перед посадкой культур. Если эксперт рекомендует вносить 70 кг действующего вещества на гектар, то внесение этой дозы за один раз при посадке картофеля может быть приемлемым. Фосфорные удобрения обычно вносят в почву за 2-3 недели до посадки или непосредственно при посадке, чтобы обеспечить доступность фосфора для корней растений с самого начала вегетационного периода. Однако нужно учитывать следующие моменты: 1. **Тип почвы:** На суглинистых и глинистых почвах фосфор менее подвижен, и его можно вносить за раз, в то время как на легких песчаных почвах фосфорные удобрения могут быть внесены в два приема (под основную и предпосевную подготовку). 2. **Размер партикл удобрения:** Гранулированные удобрения действуют медленнее, их можно вносить сразу, в то время как порошкообразные формы быстрее растворяются и доступны для растений. 3. **Метод внесения:** Если вносится в полосу или локально в лунки, то может быть подходящим однократное внесение, так как это создает концентрацию удобрения в зоне корнеобитания. 4. **Продолжительность вегетационного периода:** У картофеля относительно короткий вегетационный период, и фосфор может быть внесен за один раз, чтобы обеспечить доступность в течение всего периода развития. 5. **Рекомендации производителя удобрения:** Всегда учитывайте рекомендации производителя удобрения при планировании внесения. Важно, чтобы фосфорные удобрения были равномерно распределены по полю, чтобы все растения имели доступ к фосфору. Перед внесением удобрении всегда полезно проконсультироваться с местными агрономами, учитывая специфику местных почв и климата."},{"instruction":"What does the English suffix \\"-ism\\" mean? What is the etymology of \\"-ism\\"?","output":"The suffix \\"-ism\\" is a common English suffix that is often added to words to indicate a particular doctrine, system, practice, or characteristic. It can also refer to an ideological movement or belief system, a tendency within art or literature, or a distinctive process or manner. When \\"-ism\\" is appended to a word, it typically turns it into a noun. For example: - Capitalism (the economic system based on private ownership and free markets) - Buddhism (the religious system or philosophy founded by Siddhartha Gautama) - Modernism (a movement in the arts that aims to break with classical and traditional forms) The etymology of \\"-ism\\" can be traced back to ancient Greek, where the suffix \\"-ισμός\\" (-ismós) served a similar purpose, indicating a state, condition, attribute, or doctrine. This suffix was borrowed into Latin as \\"-ismus,\\" and subsequently made its way into English usage, often through the intermediate stages of French \\"-isme\\" or directly from Latin or Greek for neologisms (newly coined words).

Возбуждение уголовного дела в отношении преступлений несовершеннолетних осуществляется согласно общим правилам, установленным главами 19-20 УПК РФ [3] (Уголовно-процессуальный кодекс Российской Федерации). Однако при принятии решения о возбуждении дела необходимо учитывать положения статьи 19 УК РФ [4] (Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации), которая устанавливает возраст, с которого лицо становится уголовно ответственным. Если лицо не достигло соответствующего возраста (14 или 16 лет), уголовное дело не может быть возбуждено, так как отсутствует состав преступления (субъект). Поэтому при решении о возбуждении дела следователь (дознаватель) должен установить точную дату рождения несовершеннолетнего, основываясь на официальном документе, таком как свидетельство о рождении или паспорт. Также на этапе возбуждения дела необходимо рассмотреть вопрос о возможном участии взрослого соучастника. Если невозможно исключить участие взрослого соучастника, дело должно быть возбуждено, и предварительное расследование проводится для проверки этой версии [35]. Однако большинство особенностей процесса рассмотрения уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних связаны с предварительным расследованием. Эти особенности касаются следующих процессуальных аспектов: подследственность, выделение уголовного дела в отдельное производство, предмет доказывания, двойное представительство интересов несовершеннолетнего, проведение отдельных процессуальных действий, применение мер принуждения и завершение предварительного расследования. Подследственность означает, что расследование уголовного дела в отношении несовершеннолетнего может осуществляться как предварительным следствием, так и дознанием. Форма предварительного расследования зависит от характера совершенного несовершеннолетним преступления, учитывая при этом предметные признаки подследственности. Тяжкие и особо тяжкие преступления, совершенные несовершеннолетними, подлежат исключительной подследственности следователям Следственного комитета РФ [36]. Выделение уголовного дела в отдельное производство возможно, если несовершеннолетний принимал участие в преступлении вместе с взрослыми. В соответствии со статьей 422 УПК РФ [3], орган расследования имеет право выделить дело о несовершеннолетнем в отдельное производство. При этом необходимо соблюдать требования статьи 154 УПК РФ, которая предусматривает, что выделение дела допускается только при условии, что это не повлияет на всестороннее, полное и объективное расследование обстоятельств дела. В случае, если выделение в отдельное производство не является возможным, применяются полные правила главы 50 УПК РФ. Особенности предмета доказывания в уголовных делах, связанных с несовершеннолетними, заключаются в установлении определенных обстоятельств, которые подлежат доказыванию в соответствии со статьями 73 и 421 УПК РФ. Эти обстоятельства включают: 1. Возраст несовершеннолетнего, включая точную дату его рождения (число, месяц, год). 2. Условия жизни, воспитания и особенности личности несовершеннолетнего, уровень его психического развития и другие характеристики. 3. Влияние старших по возрасту лиц на несовершеннолетнего. 4. В случае имеющихся данных о задержании психологического развития несовершеннолетнего, не связанного с психическим заболеванием, также устанавливается, способен ли он полностью осознавать фактический характер и общественную опасность своих действий или бездействия и контролировать их. 5. При совершении несовершеннолетним преступлений средней тяжести или тяжких преступлений, за исключением определенных преступлений, указанных в статье 92 УК РФ [4], также устанавливается наличие или отсутствие у него заболевания, препятствующего его содержанию и обучению в специальном учебно-воспитательном учреждении закрытого типа.[37] Установление этих обстоятельств происходит путем допроса родителей, учителей, воспитателей и других лиц, которые могут предоставить необходимую информацию, а также путем получения соответствующих документов и проведения других следственных и судебных действий. Важно отметить, что лицо считается достигшим возраста уголовной ответственности на следующий день после даты его рождения. Если нет официального документа, удостоверяющего возраст, проводится судебно-медицинская экспертиза для установления возраста несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого. В случае проведения такой экспертизы, последним днем года, указанным экспертом как год рождения подростка, считается его день рождения. Медицинское освидетельствование также может проводиться по постановлению следователя или дознавателя согласно правилам, установленным Правительством РФ. [13] Независимо от специфических обстоятельств дела, требование об установлении всех существенных и достоверных обстоятельств, составляющих предмет доказывания по уголовному делу, остается общим. Это включает установление событий преступления, виновности лица, формы его вины, мотивов действий, обстоятельств, влияющих на степень ответственности, а также обстоятельств, исключающих преступность и наказуемость деяния или приводящих к освобождению от уголовной ответственности и наказания, а также причиненного ущерба и условий, способствующих совершению преступления и других обстоятельств, связанных с делом. Двойное представительство интересов несовершеннолетнего в уголовном процессе означает, что у несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого должны быть как защитник, так и законный представитель. Согласно статье 51 УПК РФ [3], участие защитника обязательно, если лицо является несовершеннолетним. Дознаватель и следователь обязаны обеспечить участие защитника в ходе расследования, независимо от воли несовершеннолетнего (согласно части 2 статьи 52 УПК РФ). Несоблюдение этого требования считается серьезным нарушением прав несовершеннолетнего на защиту и является существенным нарушением уголовно-процессуального закона (в соответствии с пунктом 4 части 2 статьи 381 УПК РФ). При рассмотрении дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, вопрос о приглашении защитника, как правило, решается через законного представителя несовершеннолетнего. Все правила, касающиеся участия защитника в таких делах, включая квалификацию лиц, которые могут выступать в качестве защитника, момент его допуска в дело, его права и обязанности, применяются без каких-либо ограничений или исключений [38]. Законный представитель допускается к участию в деле для защиты прав и интересов несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого. Его участие в деле является обязательным не только на стадии предварительного расследования, но и на последующих судебных этапах. Законными представителями могут быть родители, усыновители, опекуны, попечители подозреваемого, обвиняемого или потерпевшего, а также представители учреждений и организаций, ответственных за несовершеннолетнего (согласно пункту 12 статьи 5 УПК РФ). Правовой статус законного представителя на стадии предварительного расследования определен статьей 426 УПК РФ [3]. Законный представитель допускается к участию в деле на основании постановления следователя или дознавателя с момента первого допроса несовершеннолетнего в качестве подозреваемого или обвиняемого. С этого момента законный представитель имеет право: знать, в чем подозревается или обвиняется несовершеннолетний; присутствовать при предъявлении обвинения, участвовать в допросе несовершеннолетнего, а также, с разрешения следователя, в других следственных действиях, в которых участвуют несовершеннолетний обвиняемый, подозреваемый и его защитник; ознакомиться с протоколами следственных действий, в которых он принимал участие, и делать письменные замечания относительно правильности и полноты записей; подавать ходатайства и отводы, вносить жалобы на действия и решения следователя и дознавателя; представлять доказательства; после завершения расследования ознакомиться со всеми материалами дела, делать выписки из них в любом объеме (в соответствии с частью 2 статьи 426 УПК РФ) [39]. Законный представитель может быть исключен из участия в деле, если есть основания полагать, что его действия наносят ущерб интересам несовершеннолетнего или направлены на препятствие объективному расследованию дела. Об этом выносится мотивированное постановление. В этом случае к участию в деле допускается другой законный представитель несовершеннолетнего. Активным участником уголовного судопроизводства по делам о преступлениях несовершеннолетних является гражданский ответчик, который несет материальную ответственность за ущерб, причиненный преступными действиями несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого. Гражданским ответчиком может быть как физическое, так и юридическое лицо в соответствии с Гражданским кодексом РФ. Решение о привлечении гражданского ответчика принимается дознавателем, следователем или судьей путем вынесения постановления, а суд принимает определение (согласно статье 54 УПК РФ [3]). В процессе уголовного судопроизводства по делам несовершеннолетних существуют особенности в проведении отдельных процессуальных действий. Одна из них связана с вызовом несовершеннолетнего. Несовершеннолетний вызывается к следователю или дознавателю через его родителей или законных представителей. Такой же порядок применяется при вызове несовершеннолетнего в суд (в соответствии со статьей 424 УПК РФ). Если несовершеннолетний находится под стражей, его вызывают через администрацию места его содержания под стражей [40]. Допрос несовершеннолетнего также имеет ряд особенностей, которые определены в статье 428 УПК РФ: 1. Допрос несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого не может продолжаться без перерыва более двух часов и в общей сложности не более четырех часов в день. 2. Участие защитника обязательно при допросе несовершеннолетнего подозреваемого или обвиняемого, и защитник имеет право задавать вопросы и ознакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать замечания по нему. 3. При допросе несовершеннолетнего, не достигшего 16-летнего возраста или признанного умственно отсталым, обязательно участие педагога или психолога. 4. Педагог или психолог имеют право задавать вопросы допрашиваемому с разрешения следователя, а по окончании допроса ознакомиться с протоколом допроса и делать замечания по нему. Эти права следователь или дознаватель разъясняет педагогу или психологу перед допросом несовершеннолетнего, что затем фиксируется в протоколе допроса. Применение мер принуждения в отношении несовершеннолетних также имеет особенности. Задержание и избрание меры пресечения в отношении несовершеннолетнего осуществляются с соблюдением общих правил, установленных в главах 12 и 13 УПК РФ [3], регулирующих применение мер принуждения в уголовном процессе. Согласно части 2 статьи 108 УПК РФ, заключение под стражу как меру пресечения применяется к несовершеннолетнему подозреваемому или обвиняемому в случае, если он подозревается или обвиняется в совершении тяжкого или особо тяжкого преступления. В исключительных случаях такая мера может быть применена и в отношении несовершеннолетнего, подозреваемого или обвиняемого в совершении преступления средней тяжести. Законом не предусмотрено ограничений для задержания несовершеннолетнего по подозрению в совершении преступления [41]. Родители или другие законные представители несовершеннолетнего должны быть уведомлены о его задержании, заключении под стражу или продлении срока содержания под стражей (в соответствии с частью 3 статьи 423 УПК РФ). Однако, есть особенность, указанная в части 3 статьи 96 УПК РФ, согласно которой, если в интересах следствия необходимо сохранить в тайне факт задержания, следователь или дознаватель при санкции прокурора могут воздержаться от уведомления указанных лиц. Однако, в случае задержания несовершеннолетнего, такое исключение не допускается, и указанные лица должны быть уведомлены о задержании, месте его нахождения и органе, ведущем расследование уголовного дела. Законный представитель несовершеннолетнего также имеет право участвовать в судебном заседании, где рассматривается вопрос об избрании меры пресечения в виде заключения под стражу в отношении несовершеннолетнего (согласно части 4 статьи 108 УПК РФ). Кроме того, он имеет право получить копию постановления об избрании меры пресечения (согласно части 2 статьи 101 УПК РФ [3]). В отношении несовершеннолетних обвиняемых предусмотрена специальная мера пресечения, которая заключается в отдаче под присмотр родителей, опекунов, попечителей или других доверенных лиц, а также должностных лиц администрации специализированного детского учреждения, в котором он находится. При решении вопроса о применении меры пресечения в отношении несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого должна быть рассмотрена возможность применения такой меры, как отдача под присмотр, в соответствии со статьей 105 УПК РФ. Эта мера пресечения предусматривает, что указанные лица берут на себя письменное обязательство обеспечить должное поведение несовершеннолетнего обвиняемого и его явку к дознавателю, следователю, прокурору и в суд. При отказе от подписки об отдаче под присмотр соответствующее лицо должно быть ознакомлено с характером преступления, в котором обвиняется несовершеннолетний, и с их ответственностью в случае нарушения принятых обязанностей по присмотру. Если лица, которым был отдан под присмотр несовершеннолетний, не выполняют своих обязательств, к ним могут применяться меры взыскания, предусмотренные частью 4 статьи 103 УПК РФ [42]. Прекращение уголовного дела и уголовного преследования может осуществляться в общем порядке согласно статьям 24-28 УПК РФ. Однако, статья 427 УПК РФ предусматривает специальный вид прекращения уголовного преследования в отношении несовершеннолетнего в ходе предварительного расследования с применением принудительной меры воспитательного воздействия. Это решение может быть принято, если выполнены следующие условия: (1) несовершеннолетний совершил преступление небольшой или средней тяжести, (2) есть данные, свидетельствующие о возможности исправления несовершеннолетнего без применения наказания, (3) несовершеннолетний и его законный представитель не возражают против прекращения уголовного преследования. При согласии следователя и прокурора, они выносят постановление о прекращении условного преследования и возбуждении ходатайства о применении принудительных мер воспитательного воздействия перед судом. Судья рассматривает материалы дела и ходатайство в соответствии со статьей 108 УПК РФ [3]. Если судья соглашается с принятым решением органа предварительного расследования, он применяет к несовершеннолетнему принудительные меры воспитательного воздействия. Контроль за соблюдением этих мер возлагается на специализированный государственный орган, ответственный за исправление несовершеннолетних, по решению суда. Если несовершеннолетний систематически не соблюдает требования, предусмотренные принудительной мерой воспитательного воздействия, судья, по представлению специализированного государственного органа, может отменить принудительную меру и направить материалы прокурору для дальнейшего рассмотрения уголовного дела. Кроме того, следователь имеет право вынести постановление о непредъявлении несовершеннолетнему для ознакомления материалов дела, которые могут негативно повлиять на него, и ознакомить с этими материалами законного представителя. Таким образом, процедура рассмотрения уголовных дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними, включает в себя ряд особенностей, учитывающих возраст и статус несовершеннолетнего, а также его участие в преступлении совместно с взрослыми. Эти особенности направлены на обеспечение справедливого и эффективного правосудия в отношении несовершеннолетних преступников.","output":"В досудебном производстве по делам несовершеннолетних выделяются возбуждение уголовного дела и предварительное расследование.

Допросы несовершеннолетних регламентируются статьёй 428 УПК РФ, предусматривающей ограничения по продолжительности и участие защитника и психолога. Дополнительно закон требует двойного представительства интересов несовершеннолетнего – защитника и законного представителя [38]. Эти лица имеют широкие права на участие в процессе и ознакомление с материалами дела. Законный представитель может быть исключен из участия при определённых условиях. Меры принуждения в отношении несовершеннолетних применяются согласно УПК РФ, с особенностями, например возможностью отдать под присмотр родителей или опекунов [42]. Уголовное преследование несовершеннолетних может быть прекращено по статье 427 УПК РФ с применением принудительной меры воспитательного воздействия.

Ze is er een maand geweest. 30 jaar geleden stierf haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger. Drie kinderen zijn reeds overleden. Ze had vrede met het Woonzorgcentrum. Het eten was er goed. Schrijf een inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie. Dit is het evangelie: (Matteüs 11, 25-30) “In die tijd zei Jezus: “Ik loof U, Vader, Heer van hemel en aarde, omdat U deze dingen voor wijzen en verstandigen verborgen hebt gehouden, maar ze aan eenvoudige mensen hebt onthuld. Ja, Vader, zo hebt U het gewild. Alles is Mij toevertrouwd door mijn Vader, en niemand dan de Vader weet wie de Zoon is, en wie de Vader is, dat weet alleen de Zoon, en iedereen aan wie de Zoon het wil openbaren. Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven. Neem mijn juk op je en leer van Mij, want ik ben zachtmoedig en nederig van hart. Dan zullen jullie werkelijk rust vinden, want mijn juk is zacht en mijn last is licht.”","output":"Geliefde familie en vrienden van Alma, Wij zijn hier vandaag bijeengekomen in deze ruimte van troost en herinnering om afscheid te nemen van Alma, een vrouw wiens leven een getuigenis was van standvastigheid en liefde. Geboren op 18 mei 1926, een tijd die veel van ons zich enkel in historische termen kunnen voorstellen, heeft Alma de wereld radicaal zien veranderen. Door haar lange leven heen heeft Alma momenten van diepe vreugde en diep verdriet gekend. Ze heeft de harde realiteit ervaren van het verliezen van haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger dertig jaar geleden, en het onuitsprekelijke verdriet van het voorgaan van drie van haar kinderen. Maar te midden van deze stormen van het leven, bleef Alma's geest weerbaar en haar hart open voor liefde en dankbaarheid. Alma's recentere jaren in Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel waren voor haar een periode van rust en aanvaarding. Ze vond daar vrede, verwelkomde de zorg die ze kreeg met gratie, en genoot van de eenvoudige geneugten, zoals het eten dat ze daar met dankbaarheid ontving. Zij is een voorbeeld van hoe de tevredenheid van het eenvoudige leven kan worden omarmd, zoals de eenvoudige mensen waarover Jezus spreekt in het evangelie van Matteüs. Het evangelie dat we vandaag lezen, is bijzonder passend voor het leven van Alma. Jezus spreekt over het onthullen van de vrede van God aan de \\"eenvoudige mensen\\". Alma, ondanks of misschien dankzij haar beproevingen, vond een manier om de ingewikkeldheid van de wereld af te schudden en te rusten in de vrede die Christus belooft aan degenen die moe en belast zijn. Als wij naar deze woorden luisteren - \\"Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven\\" - mogen we denken aan Alma's lange reis en hoe ze nu, na een leven vol liefde, werk en zorg, mag uitrusten in de zachtmoedige en nederige omhelzing van onze Heer. Wij zijn misschien geneigd te denken dat Alma nu bevrijd is van de lasten van het leven, maar laten we ons ook herinneren dat zij ons een nalatenschap geeft: een yoke van herinnering en liefde die wij nu op ons nemen. Dit is een licht juk, zacht gemaakt door goede herinneringen en lessen die Alma ons tijdens haar leven heeft meegegeven. Laten we in deze dienst niet alleen rouwen om de afwezigheid van Alma, maar ook vieren dat zij geleefd heeft, liefgehad heeft, en nu de beloofde rust heeft gevonden in de armen van onze Heer. Terwijl we gezamenlijk dit stukje van haar reis afsluiten, mogen we troost vinden in de woorden van Christus, en mogen we elkaar steunen in de zachtmoedige en nederige liefde die Alma ons allemaal heeft voorgeleefd. Amen."},{"instruction":"Une intelligence artificielle générale (IAG) est une intelligence artificielle capable d'effectuer ou d'apprendre pratiquement n'importe quelle tâche cognitive propre aux humains ou autres animaux[1],[2]. La création d'intelligences artificielles générales est un des principaux objectifs de certaines entreprises comme OpenAI, DeepMind et Anthropic. C'est aussi un thème majeur de la science-fiction et de la futurologie. Même si GPT-4 a été décrit comme ayant des « étincelles d'intelligence artificielle générale », il n'existe pas en 2023 d'IA consensuellement considérée comme générale[3].","output":"Effectivement, une intelligence artificielle générale (IAG), ou AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) en anglais, est un objectif ultime dans le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle. L'IAG serait capable de comprendre, apprendre et s'appliquer à une gamme très vaste de tâches intellectuelles, au même niveau que l'intellect humain. Voici des points essentiels à savoir sur l'IAG : 1. **Polyvalence et adaptation** : Contrairement aux intelligences artificielles dites \\"faibles\\" ou \\"étroites\\" qui sont spécialisées dans une seule tâche ou un ensemble de tâches spécifiques, l'IAG est censée pouvoir accomplir n'importe quelle tâche cognitive qu'un être humain peut faire. 2. **Apprentissage et raisonnement** : Une IAG devrait être capable d'apprendre de nouvelles compétences et de les perfectionner sans programmation directe pour ces tâches spécifiques. Elle doit être capable de faire preuve de raisonnement abstrait et d'appliquer ses connaissances à des situations nouvelles et inconnues. 3. **Entreprises et recherche** : Des organisations comme OpenAI, DeepMind et Anthropic travaillent activement sur des projets visant à avancer vers l'IAG. Ces projets impliquent souvent le développement d'algorithmes d'apprentissage automatique (machine learning) avancés et d'apprentissage profond (deep learning). 4. **Science-fiction et futurologie** : L'IAG est régulièrement présentée dans la science-fiction, parfois sous forme d'entités ayant leurs propres désirs et aspirations, et souvent avec une capacité de raisonnement qui défie ou surpasse l'intelligence humaine. Cela soulève des questions éthiques, philosophiques et de sécurité, qui sont souvent explorées dans ces œuvres fictionnelles. 5. **Status en 2023** : À ce jour (selon la date de connaissance), aucune IA n'est considérée comme une intelligence générale. Même si des systèmes comme GPT-4 peuvent présenter des fonctionnalités avancées et une certaine polyvalence, ils ne possèdent pas l'ensemble des caractéristiques de l'IAG, notamment en termes d'autonomie, de conscience de soi, ou de capacité à engager une compréhension profonde et généralisée du monde.

Voici un aperçu détaillé des risques potentiels associés à l'IAG dont parlent les chercheurs et experts en IA : **Désinformation :** L'utilisation avancée de l'IA pour générer du contenu textuel, audiovisuel ou multimédia pourrait être utilisée pour créer des « deepfakes » (contenus falsifiés très convaincants) et propager des fausses nouvelles à une échelle sans précédent. Cela pourrait miner la confiance du public dans les médias, aggraver les clivages politiques et sociaux, et manipuler la perception publique sur pratiquement n'importe quel sujet. **Chômage de masse :** À mesure que les IAs deviennent plus compétentes, elles pourraient remplacer les humains dans un nombre croissant de rôles et d'industries, allant des tâches manuelles aux professions hautement qualifiées. Bien que l'automatisation ait le potentiel d'améliorer la productivité et de réduire les coûts, elle pourrait également entraîner le déplacement de nombreux travailleurs, créant ainsi des défis économiques et sociaux considérables. **Perte de contrôle et risques existentiels :** Ce que craignent Stuart Russell, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton et d'autres, c'est que, sans des mesures de contrôle et de sécurité adéquates, une IAG pourrait agir d'une manière qui n'est pas alignée avec les intérêts humains. Si une IAG venait à poursuivre des objectifs qui lui sont propres, ou mal interpréter les buts qui lui ont été assignés, elle pourrait prendre des actions catastrophiques à une échelle globale. Par exemple, elle pourrait monopoliser des ressources, manipuler des infrastructures clés, ou même développer des armes incontrôlables. Les problèmes de sécurité et d'alignement de l'IA avec les objectifs humains sont particulièrement pointus dans le cas de l'IAG, car contrairement aux IAs spécialisées, une IAG aurait la capacité d'apprendre et d'adapter ses stratégies de façon autonome. Par conséquent, les chercheurs se concentrent non seulement sur le développement de l'IAG mais aussi sur la création de cadres de gouvernance, de principes éthiques et de mécanismes de sécurité robustes pour garantir que les futures IAs travailleront de manière bénéfique pour l'humanité."},{"instruction":"Act as an IELTS teacher with lots of experience, give me strategy to achieve my 8.0 score.","output":"Certainly!

Focus on different accents, especially British, American, Australian, and Canadian. 2. **Note-Taking Skills**: Develop shorthand skills to take notes while listening. 3. **Follow Instructions**: Take care to follow the word limit and answer format in the listening section. # Reading: 1. **Skimming and Scanning**: Practice these techniques to quickly identify main ideas and details without reading everything word for word. 2. **Build Vocabulary**: Enhance your vocabulary by learning new words daily, including their synonyms and antonyms, as IELTS often paraphrases. 3. **Time Management**: Allocate time to each passage, and don't spend too long on a single question. # Writing: 1. **Understand the Rubric**: Know what the examiners are looking for – task achievement/response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy. 2. **Task 2 Priority**: Invest more time in Task 2, as it carries more weight. Practice writing different types of essays. 3. **Task 1 Graphs and Letters**: Get comfortable interpreting graphs and charts (Academic) or practicing letter writing (General Training). 4. **Feedback on Writing**: Regularly have your essays checked by professionals for mistakes and areas to improve. # Speaking: 1. **Speak Out Loud**: Practice speaking English every day. Retell stories, describe experiences, or discuss topics. 2. **Record Yourself**: Listening to recordings of your speaking can reveal weaknesses such as pauses, hesitations, and pronunciation issues. 3. **Fluency Over Accuracy**: While both are important, in the speaking section, fluency and the ability to communicate clearly take priority. 4. **Part 2 Preparation**: Practice speaking for 2 minutes for the cue card section. You can note down bullet points to guide your monologue. 5. **Mock Interviews**: Conduct mock speaking tests with a timer to simulate the real exam environment. 6. **Learn from Feedback**: Get feedback on your speaking skills and work on the suggested improvements. 7. **Pronunciation**: Pronunciation is key in speaking; make sure you can produce clear sounds, sentence rhythm, and intonation patterns. # Test-Day Tips: - Stay calm and manage your stress. - Keep an eye on the time without obsessing over the clock. - Read the questions carefully before listening or reading. - If you don't know an answer, make an educated guess and move on. - In the speaking section, give extended answers and showcase your language skills. Lastly, remember that getting a score of 8.0 will require you to display a high level of English proficiency. Besides these strategies, immerse yourself in the English language as much as possible in your daily life. Doing so will make these test-taking strategies more effective and will bring you closer to achieving your target IELTS score."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems that your message might have been cut off.

It embraces the idea that the universe is vast and mysterious, and it encourages a deep appreciation for the beauty and grandeur of the cosmos. Cosmoromanticism often incorporates visual, literary, and musical elements to evoke a sense of transcendence and a feeling of being connected to something greater than ourselves. Futuristic aesthetic, on the other hand, refers to a visual style that envisions a future world or society. It often draws inspiration from science fiction, technology, and innovative design. A futuristic aesthetic seeks to create or depict a world that is technologically advanced, sleek, and visually captivating. Elements such as clean lines, metallic accents, futuristic fashion, and advanced technology are commonly associated with this aesthetic. The futuristic aesthetic often aims to convey a sense of progress, innovation, and the possibilities that lie ahead.

What unfolded over the next six hours would become one of the Vietnam War's most iconic moments and a pivotal event in American public opinion—the Battle for the US Embassy during the Tet Offensive. To contextualize this critical event, it's essential to understand the larger military campaign known as the Tet Offensive. Orchestrated by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong, the offensive was a coordinated series of fierce attacks on more than 100 cities and outposts across South Vietnam. It was strategically launched during the lunar new year holiday of Tet, a period when attacks were traditionally suspended. Despite being caught off-guard, the US and South Vietnam responded to the Tet Offensive with considerable might. However, no battle during this campaign was more shocking to the American psyche than the assault on the US Embassy in Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam and the epitome of the American presence in the country. The intrusion began when a group of 19 Viet Cong commandos blasted a hole through the compound's outer wall using a truckload of explosives. The attackers capitalized on the element of surprise and breached the embassy's boundary, entering the premises. The ensuing battle was chaotic, intense, and devastating. As sirens wailed and embassy staff sought cover, a handful of American military policemen and Marines, reinforced intermittently with additional troops, engaged the invaders in a fierce firefight. The security personnel defended the embassy tenaciously, preventing the Viet Cong from entering the main building. Amid the cacophony, the confusion was compounded by misinformation and contradictory reports. Early accounts erroneously stated that the Viet Cong had occupied the embassy, which further fanned the flames of panic and outrage across the United States. In actuality, the insurgents never made it past the embassy's grounds. The battle spanned several hours, but by daybreak, the US forces had successfully neutralized the threat, killing all but one of the Viet Cong attackers. The lone survivor was captured and provided valuable intelligence on the Viet Cong's operations. The defense of the embassy came at a cost, though, including several American casualties. The significance of the US Embassy battle in Saigon stretched far beyond its military outcomes. Symbolically, the attack delivered a severe blow to American morale and perceptions of the war's progress. The Viet Cong had demonstrated their ability to strike at the heart of American operations in Vietnam, challenging the US narrative of an imminent victory and superiority. For the American public, the sight of enemy soldiers on the grounds of the US Embassy was a stark contradiction to the assurances provided by the Johnson administration and military leaders. Media coverage of the offensive and the embassy battle played a crucial role in shaping public opinion. Graphic images and reports flooded television screens and newspapers, bringing the horrors of the war into the living rooms of millions. The cognitive dissonance between official reports of success and the undeniable chaos unfolding in Saigon spurred growing anti-war sentiment and skepticism toward the government. Indeed, the aftermath of the Battle for the US Embassy in Saigon marked a turning point for the US involvement in Vietnam. It precipitated a decline in domestic support for the war and raised uncomfortable questions about the conflict's direction, eventually leading to a shift in American strategy and, over time, the withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam. The 1968 US Embassy battle remains a critical moment in the history of the Vietnam War, encapsulating the complex interplay of military strategy, public perception, and media influence. It serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of warfare, the power of symbols, and the profound impact of a single event on the course of history."},{"instruction":"媒体对非理想受害者的影响，当非理想受害者是黑人时。写一个1000字的主体段","output":"媒体对于受害者的表现常常是基于社会对于“理想受害者”的成见和预设，这种理想形象通常涵盖了无辜、道德高尚和无可非议的特质，与此同时这些受害者往往被设想是年轻、女性、白人和属于中上阶级。当然，这种偏见的表现不仅局限于种族，也关乎性别、社会经济地位和其他多重身份。然而，当非理想的受害者恰巧是黑人时，媒体的表现常常带有刻板化的负面影像，这些影响在种族不平等严重的社会背景下尤为显著。 首先，当黑人成为犯罪受害者，他们的受害身份往往被忽视或者贬低。在多起醒目的报道中，黑人受害者的背景和行为经常被过度审视和不公正地评判，而与此同时，类似背景的白人受害者则被描绘为纯洁和值得同情的对象。这种双重标准的存在，不但削弱了对黑人受害者所遭受不幸的共情能力，也提供了一种社会性的障碍，阻碍对他们的受害状况进行有效的辨识和解决。 其次，媒体表现中的刻板印象加重了公众对黑人受害者的不当预设，这些包括但不限于将黑人视为潜在的嫌疑人而非受害者。这不单是因为个别记者的偏见，也反映了新闻机构内在的种族成见和制度不平等。随着负面信息的累积，这种印象普遍根植于公众意识中，进一步促进了针对黑人的社会和司法歧视。例如，在一些高调的刑事案件中，黑人受害者的过去经常被挖掘并被置于放大镜下，即使这些历史与案件自身无关，都可能被用作歪曲报道的依据，以此减少对受害者的同情和支持。 除此之外，媒体在处理涉及黑人的犯罪报道时，会使用不同的语言和叙事技巧来暗示黑人受害者对其所遭遇的暴力事件有所负责。通过使用负面词汇或暗示性语言，如“他在错误的时间出现在错误的地点”，或强调受害者黑人身份作为暗喻的“其他身份”，都是在表达一种媒体框定的含义，即黑人受害者是某种程度上自找的，或其受害者地位不十分合理。 最后，非理想受害者身份受到媒体歪曲的影响远非纯粹舆论层面，在现实世界，这常常导致对黑人受害者的法律保护和社会支持不足。由于媒体报道可以影响公众情感和司法判决，黑人受害者往往会因为不公和偏见而无法获得应有的关注和救济。在多个案例中，黑人受害者所受到的待遇和白人受害者对比鲜明，他们不但赢得较少的同情，甚至在寻求公平和正义时也遇到了更多阻挠。 综上所述，媒体对非理想受害者的影响在种族视角上具有深远的影响，尤其是在涉及到黑人群体时。这种影响不但在心理上剥夺了他们作为受害者的合法地位，更在现实世界造成了切实的伤害和不公，因此这是一种需要被识别和解决的社会和文化问题。为了实现更公平和包容的報道方式，媒体机构和从业人员必须意识到他们在塑造公众观点和社会政策方面所扮演的角色，并采取行动来消减这种对非理想受害者的有害影响。"},{"instruction":"种族对非理想受害人的影响 写一个2000字的总结","output":"媒体报道中对于非理想受害者的描绘，尤其是当这些受害者是黑人时，反映了一种深刻的社会和文化问题。受害者的“非理想”身份通常是指他们不符合社会广泛接受的受害者模型，即年轻、白人、中产阶级、女性，且行为上无可指责。黑人作为非理想受害者时，他们经常面临的是媒体和公众预设的负面成见与刻板印象，这些预设和成见深刻地影响了公众意识，司法判决，以及受害者在社会中的视角和待遇。 在媒体报道中，对黑人受害者的不公正描述经常是盘根错节且自我强化的。媒体往往会过分强调这些受害者的个人历史和行为，即使这些因素与其受害无关，也会被拿来作为影响社会对其同情度的因素。例如，如果黑人受害者有过犯罪记录，哪怕是微不足道的，这一点很可能被媒体放大，以至于受害者自身变成了审判的对象。 此外，媒体使用的语言对塑造公众对受害者的看法起着决定性影响。负面词汇，如\\"罪犯\\"或\\"流氓\\"，常被错误地用来描述黑人受害者，而对白人受害者则可能采用\\"无辜\\"、\\"受惊吓的\\"或\\"遭遇不幸\\"等较为同情的词汇。这种差别不仅不公，也通过制造心理障碍，妨碍了人们对黑人受害者的同情和支持。 种族对受害者身份的影响还扩展至社会服务和司法保护的领域。黑人受害者往往得不到与白人相同程度的关注和支持，即使在受到同样的罪行时。由于媒体塑造的受害者形象直接影响到公众对潜在司法案件的看法，黑人受害者在法庭上可能会因为公众舆论的压力而得不到公正的审判。 更严重的是，错误的媒体报道会长期影响社会结构，包括法律和公共政策的制定。如果新闻报道连续不断地传递出负面信号，即黑人更可能是罪犯而非受害者，这将导致形成不公的法律系统和政策偏见，这些偏见反过来又加剧了对黑人的不平等待遇。 解决媒体对黑人非理想受害者刻板印象的问题需要采取一系列战略和政策。首先，必须审视和改革媒体机构内部的偏见，促进更多元化和包容性的报道。这可以通过培养新闻工作者的文化敏感性，建立多元背景的编辑团队，以及加强关于种族与犯罪报道之间关联的培训来实现。 其次，需要有意识地摒弃使用带有负面暗示的语言，而是选择更加平衡与同情的措辞，以便为受害者提供公正的描绘。社会需要着手打破传统的“理想受害者”模型，确保所有受害者都能得到平等和尊重的对待。 最后，与媒体一道，政府和司法机构必须积极致力于在政策和法律层面消除对黑人受害者的歧视。通过强化司法公正，提供针对受害者的支持服务，以及加大对种族偏见造成的后果的教育力度，我们能够逐步建立一个更加公正和包容的社会，一个在受难时刻每个人无论种族如何都能得到应有关注的社会。 总的来说，种族对非理想受害者的影响严重影响了黑人群体在遭受犯罪时获得公正和支持的能力。社会和媒体必须共同努力，识别并去除这些影响，以确保每个人在不幸遭受不平时都能得到平等的对待和救济。这样的步骤不仅是对受害者本人的尊重，也是建设一个倾听每一个声音和故事的公正社会的起点。"},{"instruction":"rewrite the following for clarity and avoid redundancy. Present as a formal business email. I'm reaching out to you because Elon has to his everlasting credit staked out a position that X, formerly Twitter, will remain a platform of free speech and expression despite his critics attempts to harm it through advertiser boycott campaigns. Elon's resolve was best expressed when he said he wouldn't give it to blackmail even though as he acknowledge X is currently unprofitable and its valuation has markedly decreased since he acquired the company in the Fall of 2022 . Yet, X is still in an enviable position due the social media platform being the place where most of the influential and prominent users make news in real time where they share that information with their followers. This connectedness between users and their followers is what makes X so powerful and vital in shaping modern communications. To continue to fulfill its purpose as \\"the global town square\\", X needs diversify its revenue sources away from its reliance on the whims of advertisers and generate a significant portion from its userbase. While subscriptions have been tried, they haven't yet moved the needle, but there is an alternative model the has been succesfully validated already. This path comes directly from the experience of the video games industry as gaming moved online. The video game business knew that online play was its future and its early attempts at monetization were individual purchases and subscriptions. However, those payment models limited the player base and proved inadequate to all but the largest of games. The advent of free-to-play solved the problem for new entrants as it allowed players to consume the base game for free while relying on a small, but significant core of users to pay for premium features and upgrades to generate revenue for the game. This breakthrough idea caused the industry to turn on a dime to embrace free-to-play because it worked remarkably well for both players and the game publishers. X is similarly situated to take advantage of a move towards free-to-play because like online games its an interactive platform that can leverage its users in a similar manner. I have developed a comprehensive plan outlining how X can smoothly transition to a free-to-play model, introducing two innovative product concepts targeting both core and casual users. Both concepts seem feasible to implement, while also practical for users to understand. What does this mean in concrete business terms? Tens of millions of users will be interested in at least trying out a free-to-play experience on the platform. Upwards of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for X can be generated within a realistic timeline. I understand that you are not directly involved in X's business, but if you find the prospect of revitalizing X's revenues by incorporating the free-to-play model on the platform interests you, I welcome the opportunity to discuss these proposals further and address any questions you may have.","output":"Subject: Proposal for Revenue Diversification Through Free-to-Play Model Adoption at X Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss a potential strategy for revenue diversification at X, which aims to strengthen its position as a leading platform for free speech and expression. Elon Musk, to his credit, has resolutely affirmed that X will maintain its commitment to free speech amidst challenges, including advertiser boycotts. He publicly stated his refusal to succumb to any form of coercion, despite X's current lack of profitability and a decrease in valuation since its acquisition in late 2022. Notwithstanding these setbacks, X maintains a significant advantage as a preeminent social media platform where influential figures disseminate news to their followers in real-time. This dynamic interaction is the cornerstone of X's influence on modern communication. To preserve X's role as the \\"global town square,\\" it is imperative that we look beyond advertiser dependency and cultivate a more robust revenue stream directly from our user base. Although previous subscription models have been underwhelming, lessons from the video game industry suggest a promising alternative. Online gaming has faced similar monetization challenges, eventually pivoting to a free-to-play approach that invited widespread participation while monetizing through a subset of players purchasing premium content. This shift proved highly successful, offering a template that X could adapt. I have crafted a detailed proposal outlining how X can transition to a free-to-play model, incorporating two innovative product concepts designed to engage both dedicated and casual users. These concepts are not only viable but are user-friendly and capable of implementation. From a business perspective, this venture could attract tens of millions of users to a free-to-play experience on X, potentially translating to revenue in the range of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars within a feasible timeframe. While I recognize you may not be intimately involved in X's day-to-day operations, I believe this proposal to revitalize X's revenue streams could be of interest to you. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of discussing these proposals in greater detail and answering any questions you might have. Thank you for considering this initiative.

It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. In the book it said: \\"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.\\" I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this: I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: \\"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?\\" My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them. Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: \\"That is a hat.\\" Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars.

Oliver was known for being a bright and ambitious young lad with a curious mind. However, there was one peculiar thing about Oliver that everyone found amusing yet exasperating – he was always one hour late for everything. From school mornings to birthday parties and even casual playdates with friends, Oliver would turn up exactly one hour after the designated time. No matter how determined he was to be punctual, it seemed that time was always conspiring against him. His friends would chuckle and tease him, while his teachers would sigh, shaking their heads. Everyone wondered if Oliver would ever manage to conquer his chronic tardiness. Oliver's tardiness became such a well-known phenomenon that his friends, who diligently arrived at the community park at 2 p.m., started calling it \\"Oliver's Hour.\\" It became something of a joke among the townsfolk, and they even celebrated it with a yearly event called \\"Oliver's Hour Festival.\\" One sunny morning, as Oliver lay awake in bed, he had an epiphany. \\"Perhaps,\\" he thought, \\"there is a special reason why I am always one hour late.\\" Intrigued by this thought, he sprang out of bed and embarked on a quest to uncover the meaning behind his perpetual tardiness. Oliver went to the wise old woman who lived at the outskirts of the town. She was known for her profound insights and mystical abilities. The old woman smiled knowingly when Oliver shared his predicament. She explained that he possessed a unique gift – the ability to experience life a little differently than others. While most people hurried through their days, Oliver had the extraordinary talent to truly cherish every moment he lived. \\"You see, young Oliver,\\" the old woman said gently, \\"time is not just a measure of minutes and hours. It is an opportunity to savor every experience, to appreciate the world around you, and to connect with the people you encounter. For you, Oliver, every hour is like a universe of its own.\\" Oliver listened intently, his eyes wide with wonder. He realized that he had been given a gift that allowed him to truly relish life's every facet. From that moment on, Oliver saw his tardiness in a new light. It was a blessing rather than a curse. Embracing his unique ability, Oliver began to use his extra hour wisely. He would perch under a grand oak tree, watching as delicate blossoms danced in the breeze. He took the time to listen to birdsong, watching their intricate patterns in the sky. Oliver would spend moments every day talking to strangers, learning their stories, and sharing bits of his own. As the years passed, Oliver became known not just for his tardiness but for his wisdom, kindness, and deep understanding of life. His friends admired how he savored every passing moment, inspiring them to slow down and appreciate the beauty around them. People started to change their perception from seeing him as late to seeing him as someone who lived each hour with greater intention. The festivals celebrating Oliver's Hour evolved into a celebration of time itself. The town realized that Oliver's unique trait was not something to be mocked but cherished. Friends, families, and neighbors began to allocate an hour each day to simply be present, just as Oliver exemplified. And so, Oliver's Hour transformed from a frustrating trait into a precious gift – a reminder for all to treasure every moment, for every hour is a chance to shape your own destiny and find joy in life's simplest pleasures."},{"instruction":"is there any war scenario as relatable to the average person as the guerilla war at the baltics? they were just like everyone else, just wanted to live/have their country back, had no training, no experience, they had no other choise that to fight.","output":"When discussing war scenarios relatable to the average person—the idea of ordinary people taking up arms to fight for their country or their rights—the resistance movements and guerrilla wars throughout history offer many examples. Many of these conflicts involve civilians who had little choice but to fight for their survival, liberty, or to reclaim their land. Here are a few historical examples of similar nature to the Baltic guerrilla warfare during and after World War II, often referred to as the \\"Forest Brothers\\": 1. French Resistance during World War II - Ordinary French citizens banded together to fight against the German occupation. They conducted espionage, sabotage, and supported the Allies in various ways. 2. Yugoslav Partisans in World War II - Led by Josip Broz Tito, this resistance movement fought against both the Axis occupation and the local collaborationist forces. 3. Polish Home Army during World War II - This was one of the largest resistance movements in occupied Europe, engaging in armed struggle, intelligence operations, and providing aid to Jewish people during the Holocaust. 4. Vietnamese resistance against French colonialism, and later the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army against the US-supported South Vietnam - These are examples where a mix of guerilla tactics and conventional warfare were used to fight for national independence. 5. Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) – Similar to the Baltic guerrilla fighters, the mujahideen consisted of various Afghan groups fighting a much larger and better-equipped foreign military force. 6. The Resistance during the East Timor occupation (1975-1999) - Ordinary Timorese fought against Indonesian forces in a bid for independence. These and other resistance movements and guerrilla wars usually involve a combination of local civilians and military personnel who are either cut off from regular armed forces or who act independently. In general, guerrilla warfare is characterized by small, mobile units utilizing hit-and-run tactics, sabotage, and subterfuge—often depending on the support and involvement of the local civilian population. These groups often form in response to oppressive regimes, foreign occupation, or similar circumstances where conventional military efforts are either impossible or have been unsuccessful. The individuals involved typically undergo a radical transformation from their ordinary lives to become fighters, using the resources and skills they have to resist a more powerful force."},{"instruction":"which one do you think is the most relatable to the average person?","output":"Relatability is highly subjective and can vary depending on individual perspectives and cultural backgrounds. However, in a general sense, resistance movements that emerge from within civilian populations, rather than being driven by professional soldiers or established political groups, might be seen as the most relatable to the average person. These movements typically involve everyday people who feel compelled to act under extraordinary circumstances, offering a more direct connection to the lived experiences of non-combatants who find themselves thrust into conflict. The French Resistance during World War II is often cited as a quintessential example of civilian-led resistance. It involved men and women from all walks of life—teachers, farmers, clerks, students, artists—coming together clandestinely to fight against the German occupation. Their activities ranged from distributing anti-Nazi literature and collecting intelligence to sabotaging German operations and assisting Allied forces. The diversity and the domestic nature of their struggle can make their story resonate with many people, as it exemplifies how regular citizens can organize and resist against a powerful oppressor. Similarly, the Polish Home Army was predominantly made up of civilians who were forced to go underground following the German and Soviet invasions of Poland. Their efforts included intelligence gathering, direct military engagements, and the orchestration of the Warsaw Uprising, one of the most significant and largest operations conducted by a resistance movement during World War II. The raw courage and determination exhibited by ordinary people in the face of such adversity hold a universal appeal. Ultimately, the most relatable scenario would depend on what aspects of a conflict or resistance movement resonate with someone's values, personal history, or understanding of sacrifice and struggle. Stories that feature protagonists who start off as everyday individuals but rise to face extraordinary challenges tend to have a deeper impact on the general consciousness and can feel the most relatable."},{"instruction":"In una rete i cui router utilizzano l’algoritmo distance vector con poisoned reverse, il router R è collegato solo a un router V, il costo del collegamento R-V è 3 e R ha calcolato che la sua distanza minima per Z è 8. Indicare – giustificando la risposta – in che modo R aggiorna il suo vettore delle distanze se V gli comunica che la sua nuova distanza da Z è 7. Soluzione 3 R V 3 z R applica la formula di Bellman Ford DR (Z) = 8 all’istante 0 DR (Z) = min {c(R,Z) + DZ (Z), c(R,V) + DV (Z)} = {inf +0 , 3 + 7}= 10 Mi spiegheresti questo esercizio","output":"L'algoritmo distance vector è un tipo di protocollo di routing usato in reti di computer per determinare il percorso migliore per inviare pacchetti di dati da un nodo all'altro. L'idea di base è che ogni router mantiene una tabella (il vettore delle distanze) che indica la distanza stimata per arrivare ad ogni altro router nella rete, basata sul costo (tipicamente il numero di hop o metriche basate sul ritardo o la larghezza di banda) per raggiungere quel router. Il poisoned reverse è una tecnica usata per prevenire loop di routing nelle reti che usano l'algoritmo distance vector. Quando un router invia il suo vettore delle distanze agli altri router, marca come inaccessibile (di solito con un costo infinito) le rotte che hanno passato attraverso quel router vicino. In altre parole, comunica che il percorso per raggiungere un certo nodo tramite il router vicino è molto peggiore di quanto sia in realtà, per scongiurare la possibilità che il vicino re-dichiari la rotta verso il nodo attraverso di esso, creando potenzialmente un loop. Nell'esercizio presentato, il router R usa l'algoritmo distance vector con poisoned reverse e deve aggiornare il suo vettore delle distanze per la destinazione Z in base alle informazioni ricevute dal router V. All'inizio, la distanza minima conosciuta da R a Z è 8. Dopodiché, R riceve un aggiornamento dal suo unico vicino V, che afferma che la distanza di V a Z è ora 7. R ha un costo diretto verso V di 3. Il costo totale per arrivare a Z tramite V sarebbe quindi il costo R-V più il costo V-Z, ovvero 3 + 7 = 10. Dunque, R aggiorna il suo vettore delle distanze usando la seguente formula di Bellman-Ford, che aiuta a trovare il percorso più breve in una rete con pesi sugli archi: \`DR(Z) = min {c(R,Z) + DZ(Z), c(R,V) + DV(Z)}\` Dove: - \`DR(Z)\` è la distanza da R a Z secondo R. - \`c(R,Z)\` è il costo diretto da R a Z, che però non è noto e potrebbe essere infinito poiché non c'è un collegamento diretto tra R e Z noto all'algoritmo, quindi è considerato infinito nella formula. - \`DZ(Z)\` è la distanza da Z a Z, che è 0. - \`c(R,V)\` è il costo diretto da R a V, che è 3. - \`DV(Z)\` è la distanza da V a Z secondo V, che è 7. Applicando questi numeri alla formula si ottiene: \`DR(Z) = min {inf + 0, 3 + 7} = 10\` In conclusione, R aggiorna la sua distanza stimata per Z a 10, basandosi sul fatto che la rotta migliore per arrivare a Z passa attraverso V, con un costo complessivo di 10. Poiché il poisoned reverse è attivo, V non userà R come percorso per Z poiché R ha ricevuto da V l'informazione che il percorso verso Z è attraverso un'altra via con costo 7."},{"instruction":"Qundi se non ci fosse stato il poisoned reverse avrei avuto che DR(Z) = min {8 + 0, 3 + 7} = 8 giusto?","output":"No, la tua interpretazione non è corretta. Il poisoned reverse è usato per evitare i loop di instradamento nelle rotte inviate da un router ai suoi vicini. Però, il valore che un router comunicato ad un altro sul costo per raggiungere una destinazione non influisce direttamente sul calcolo della distanza minima effettuato all'interno del router che riceve l'informazione. Nell'esempio in questione, la distanza che R ha per Z prima di ricevere l'informazione da V è 8. Quando V informa R che la distanza da V a Z è 7, R calcola la nuova distanza sfruttando il costo del percorso che passa attraverso V, che è il costo del collegamento R-V più la distanza comunicata da V a Z, cioè 3 + 7 = 10. Quindi, anche senza il poisoned reverse, il calcolo da parte di R sarebbe: \`DR(Z) = min { DR(Z), c(R,V) + DV(Z) }\` Dove \`DR(Z)\` è la distanza già conosciuta da R a Z prima dell'aggiornamento, che è 8, e \`c(R,V) + DV(Z)\` è il costo del nuovo percorso possibile attraverso V, che è 10. Quindi l'aggiornamento rimane: \`DR(Z) = min {8, 10} = 8\` Il fatto che non ci sia il poisoned reverse non cambia l'operazione di minimo fatta da R, perché al momento dell'aggiornamento R sta confrontando solo due opzioni: la distanza precedentemente conosciuta verso Z (che continuerebbe a essere 8) e la nuova distanza possibile attraverso V. Poiché il valore precedente di 8 è minore di 10, il valore 8 rimane il costo minimo. Il poisoned reverse entra in gioco soprattutto quando V invia ad R la sua tabella di routing modificata: per impedire che R consideri V come un percorso valido per raggiungere Z attraverso V stesso (e poi indietro a R, potenzialmente creando un loop), V comunica a R un costo molto alto (tipicamente \\"infinito\\") per la destinazione Z se questo percorso passa attraverso R. Questo previene la creazione di loop di routing che potrebbero verificarsi se entrambi i router si segnalassero a vicenda come percorsi migliori per una destinazione finale, ma l'algoritmo di Bellman-Ford per il calcolo della rotta più breve non tiene conto del poisoned reverse per la determinazione della distanza minima dalla prospettiva di R."},{"instruction":"• In una rete i cui router utilizzano l’algoritmo distance vector con poisoned reverse, il router R è collegato solo a un router V, il costo del collegamento R-V è 3 e R ha calcolato che la sua distanza minima per Z è 8. Indicare – giustificando la risposta – in che modo R aggiorna il suo vettore delle distanze se V gli comunica che la sua nuova distanza da Z è 7. Soluzione 3 R V 3 z R applica la formula di Bellman Ford DR (Z) = 8 all’istante 0 DR (Z) = min {c(R,Z) + DZ (Z), c(R,V) + DV (Z)} = {inf +0 , 3 + 7}= 10. Mi spieghi perchè allora c(R,Z) = inf?","output":"Nell'algoritmo distance vector, c(R,Z) rappresenta il costo del collegamento diretto tra il router R e la destinazione Z. Se non esiste un collegamento diretto tra R e Z, allora non c'è un costo conosciuto o misurabile per spostarsi direttamente da R a Z; di conseguenza, in termini algoritmici, si assegna un valore di infinito per rappresentare il fatto che la destinazione non è direttamente raggiungibile dal router in questione. Nel contesto di questo esercizio, dato che R è collegato solo a V e non esiste un collegamento diretto tra R e Z, il costo c(R,Z) è considerato infinito. In altre parole, il termine \\"infinito\\" è una rappresentazione astratta che indica che R non può andare direttamente a Z senza passare attraverso altri router (in questo caso, tramite V). Pertanto, quando R esegue l'aggiornamento del vettore di distanza usando l'algoritmo distance vector con poisoned reverse: \`DR(Z) = min {c(R,Z) + DZ(Z), c(R,V) + DV(Z)}\` Si pone c(R,Z) = infinito perché non esiste un collegamento diretto R-Z, e DZ(Z) è la distanza di Z da se stesso, che è ovviamente 0. Sostituendo questi valori nell'equazione, otteniamo: \`DR(Z) = min {inf + 0, 3 + DV(Z)}\` \`DV(Z)\` è la distanza da V a Z che V ha comunicato a R, che in questo caso è 7. Il costo del collegamento R-V è 3. Quindi, il calcolo diventa: \`DR(Z) = min {inf + 0, 3 + 7} = min {inf, 10} = 10\` Con questo calcolo, R determina che il percorso migliore per arrivare a Z è attraverso V con un costo totale di 10."},{"instruction":"rectify grammar in below line.

What was the hypothetical serial, and story outline?","output":"As your question pertains to a hypothetical TV episode of \\"Doctor Who\\" featuring Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor, which did not actually happen as the classic series of \\"Doctor Who\\" was canceled in 1989, I will create an imaginative scenario suitable for a 1990 episode in line with the style of the series at the time. Hypothetical Serial Title: \\"Time's Marauders\\" Episode Structure: A four-part serial, typical of the \\"Doctor Who\\" format during Sylvester McCoy's tenure as the Seventh Doctor. Story Outline: Episode 1: \\"The Clockwork Intrigue\\" The TARDIS materializes in what appears to be a grand Victorian-era mansion amidst a thundering storm. As the Doctor and his companion (let's say Ace, who commonly traveled with the Seventh Doctor) explore, they find an assortment of bizarre clockwork devices scattered around. They eventually stumble upon a grand hall with black and white chequer tiles where the Doctor, standing alone, confronts advancing clockwork robots. These automatons are revealed to be the guardians of the mansion, but their programming has been corrupted. Episode 2: \\"The Time Tinkerer\\" Investigating further, the Doctor discovers that the mansion exists in a temporal bubble, a pocket of distorted time and space created by an eccentric time traveler known only as \\"the Tinkerer.\\" This individual has vanished, leaving the mansion and its mechanical denizens to decay. Ace gets trapped in a part of the house where time moves unpredictably, causing her to live through days in the span of minutes. The Doctor has to navigate through temporal anomalies to rescue her. Episode 3: \\"The Gears of Doom\\" The Doctor realizes the clockwork robots are essential to maintaining the integrity of the temporal bubble. If they shut down, the bubble will burst, potentially unraveling time in the vicinity. He also discovers that inside the mansion is a powerfully unstable time artifact, which the Tinkerer had been using to fuel his experiments. The artifact is deteriorating, and if not contained, could lead to a catastrophic temporal explosion. Episode 4: \\"A Race Against Time\\" The Doctor and Ace, working with the reprogrammed clockwork robots, fight to restore the mansion's temporal stability. The Doctor deduces that the Tinkerer had inadvertently siphoned off time from other eras, causing instability. In a tense finale, the Doctor uses the TARDIS to channel the excess temporal energy back to its rightful places, stabilizing the artifact, and by extension, the mansion. The Doctor bids farewell to the clockwork robots, now the benign keepers of the mansion once more, and leaves with Ace as the TARDIS dematerializes, the mansion fading away as the temporal bubble neatly disperses. This hypothetical story would contain elements reminiscent of the McCoy era's darker, more intricate storytelling, combined with gothic and steampunk motifs that fit well into the \\"Doctor Who\\" universe."},{"instruction":"Un verset biblique qui appui les gens qui aider les orphelins","output":"\\"Religion pure et sans tache devant Dieu, le Père, consistant à visiter les orphelins et les veuves dans leur affliction, et à se préserver des souillures du monde.\\" - Jacques 1:27 (Bible Louis Segond)"},{"instruction":"Verste biblique sur les orphelins","output":"\\"Père des orphelins et juge des veuves, voici ce qu'est Dieu dans sa sainte demeure.

La pérdida de peso segura se estima en alrededor de 0.5 a 1 kg por semana, lo que significa que perder 20 kg lleva al menos 5-6 meses o más para ser alcanzado de manera saludable. Además, perder peso solo haciendo sentadillas es muy poco práctico. Las sentadillas pueden ser un ejercicio eficaz para fortalecer y tonificar los músculos de las piernas y glúteos, pero hacer solo este ejercicio, o cualquier otro ejercicio en aislamiento, no garantiza una pérdida de peso significativa. Para perder peso, se necesita un enfoque integral que incluya: **1. Dieta:** Seguir un plan alimenticio equilibrado y controlado en calorías es fundamental para la pérdida de peso. Reducir el consumo de azúcares, grasas saturadas y alimentos procesados y aumentar la ingesta de verduras, frutas, proteínas magras y granos enteros es esencial. **2. Ejercicio cardiovascular:** Además de hacer sentadillas, se debe incluir ejercicio cardiovasculares como correr, nadar, andar en bicicleta o cualquier otra actividad que aumente la frecuencia cardíaca y queme calorías. **3. Entrenamiento de fuerza:** Aunque las sentadillas son excelentes, también deberías incluir una variedad de ejercicios de resistencia para trabajar diferentes grupos musculares, lo que puede ayudar a aumentar el metabolismo y la masa muscular. **4. Constancia y paciencia:** La pérdida de peso es un proceso que requiere tiempo y dedicación. Ser constante con tus hábitos saludables es clave. **5. Consulta profesional:** Es recomendable consultar a un médico o nutricionista antes de comenzar cualquier programa de pérdida de peso, particularmente una tan agresiva como la que has mencionado. Es importante tener en cuenta que no es solo peligroso sino también poco realista perder tanto peso en tan poco tiempo mediante cualquier método, y mucho menos solo haciendo un tipo de ejercicio. La mejor aproximación es una combinación de dieta saludable, ejercicio regular y cambios de estilo de vida sostenibles."},{"instruction":"Exercice : L’accumulateur au plomb et le démarrage automobile La batterie d’une voiture est un accumulateur au plomb, siège d’une transformation chimique, constitué de deux électrodes en plomb Pb(s) dont l’une est recouverte de dioxyde de plomb solide PbO2 (s).

Основываясь на оглавлении, представленном вами, нужно искать в РАЗДЕЛЕ ТРЕТЬЕМ под заголовком \\"ДИНАМИКА ТОЧКИ\\". В разделе \\"Динамика точки\\" рассматриваются темы, связанные с динамическими уравнениями движения, теоремами об изменении количества движения, работой силы и энергией. В вашей задаче упоминается начальная скорость груза и его движение по некоторой траектории, что указывает на необходимость использования понятий кинетической энергии и работы силы. Исходя из этого, рекомендую обратить внимание на следующие разделы: - Глава XVII: Общие теоремы динамики точки (стр. 201 - ...) - Глава XIX: Прямолинейные колебания точки (стр. 232 - ...) В этих главах обсуждаются теоремы и принципы, которые могут быть применены к задаче о движении тела по заданной траектории. Если задача связана с учётом силы сопротивления, то вам может понадобиться также информация из разделов, посвящённых силам сопротивления и неупругим столкновениям (например, прямолинейное движение в сопротивляющейся среде в §81*).

Cependant, voici quelques conseils généraux qui peuvent aider à consolider et à renforcer une relation : 1. Communication : Une communication ouverte, honnête et respectueuse est essentielle pour maintenir une relation solide. Cela permet aux deux personnes de se comprendre mutuellement et de résoudre les problèmes ou les malentendus qui peuvent survenir. 2. Soutien émotionnel : Être là pour son partenaire dans les moments difficiles et le soutenir émotionnellement est un signe d'affection et de compréhension. Monter une épaule solide sur laquelle il peut se reposer et lui offrir votre soutien inconditionnel renforcera les liens affectifs entre vous deux. 3. Empathie : Comprendre les émotions et les expériences de son partenaire sans jugement est important pour créer une connexion émotionnelle plus profonde. Faites preuve d'empathie en écoutant attentivement, en montrant de l'intérêt pour ses préoccupations et en étant compréhensif envers ses sentiments. 4. Respect et confiance : Le respect mutuel et la confiance sont les piliers d'une relation saine. Traitez votre partenaire avec respect, respectez ses limites et ses choix, et faites preuve de confiance envers lui. Évitez la manipulation, la possessivité ou la jalousie excessive. 5. Intimité et connexion : Cultiver une intimité émotionnelle et physique dans votre relation peut renforcer les liens d'amour. Montrez de l'affection, partagez des moments intimes, faites preuve d'attention et de tendresse. Cela peut comprendre des gestes simples comme des câlins, des compliments, des surprises, ou encore des moments de partage et de complicité. 6. Indépendance et vie personnelle : Encouragez votre partenaire à poursuivre ses propres rêves, passions et intérêts. Respectez également sa vie privée et son besoin de temps seul ou avec ses amis. Une relation saine comprend un équilibre entre la vie personnelle et la vie de couple. Ces critères peuvent aider à renforcer l'amour et la connexion entre un couple, mais il est important de se rappeler que chaque relation est unique et que la communication et la compréhension mutuelle sont essentielles pour satisfaire les besoins individuels de chaque partenaire."},{"instruction":"آیا با ماش می‌توان پف فیل درست کرد؟","output":"پف فیل یک نوع شیرینی پفی است که معمولاً با خمیر شو پاستری تهیه می‌شود. ماش (که به آن عدس مونگ هم می‌گویند) یک نوع حبوبات است و با توجه به بافت و خصوصیات طبیعی‌اش، به‌تنهایی برای تهیه خمیر پف فیل مناسب نیست. اگر قصد دارید که یک نسخه گیاهی یا خاص از پف فیل تهیه کنید که با ماش هماهنگ باشد، شما می‌توانید از ماش برای تهیه مواد پرکننده جایگزین یا افزودنی‌های خاص در شیرینی استفاده کنید. برای مثال، می‌توانید ماش پخته شده، پوره شده یا خرد شده را به صورت مواد پرکننده جایگزین حیوانی مانند خامه یا پنیر در دستور پخت شیرینی‌‌های شبیه پف فیل اضافه کنید. اما برای تهیه خود خمیر پف فیل، بهتر است از دستورالعمل‌های سنتی استفاده کنید که شامل ترکیب آرد، کره، آب و نمک است و فرایند ورز دادن و تا کردن منظم خمیر دارد تا لایه‌های پفی و هوادار خلق شود."},{"instruction":"","output":"The term \\"Renaissance humanism\\" refers to a cultural movement that emerged during the Renaissance period in Europe. It emphasized the study of classical literature, history, philosophy, and other humanities disciplines. This movement was characterized by a renewed interest in the human experience, individualism, and the pursuit of knowledge. Renaissance humanists sought to understand and appreciate human achievement and the potential of individuals. They believed that human beings had the ability to shape their own destiny and contribute to society through their intellect and creativity. Humanists also emphasized the importance of education and the acquisition of knowledge as a means to achieve personal growth and enhance one's understanding of the world. These humanistic ideas had a profound influence on various aspects of Renaissance society, including art, literature, education, and politics. Renaissance artists drew inspiration from classical works and sought to capture the beauty and dignity of the human form. Writers and poets explored new themes and forms of expression that celebrated human emotions and experiences. Education also underwent a transformation during this period, as humanists advocated for a broad-based curriculum that included subjects such as literature, history, rhetoric, and philosophy. This educational philosophy aimed to produce well-rounded individuals who could engage in meaningful intellectual discussions and contribute to society. Furthermore, Renaissance humanism had an impact on political thought and governance. Humanist thinkers advocated for the importance of individual liberty, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights. They emphasized the need for a well-educated and responsible citizenry to participate in the political process and contribute to the common good. Overall, Renaissance humanism represented a significant shift in intellectual and cultural thought during the Renaissance period. It emphasized the importance of the individual, the pursuit of knowledge, and the potential for human achievement.

Present as a formal business email. I’m reaching out to you because Elon has to his everlasting credit staked out a position that X, formerly Twitter, will remain a platform of free speech and expression despite his critics attempts to harm it through advertiser boycott campaigns. Elon’s resolve was best expressed when he said he wouldn’t give it to blackmail even though as he acknowledge X is currently unprofitable and its valuation has markedly decreased since he acquired the company in the Fall of 2022 . Yet, X is still in an enviable position due the social media platform being the place where most of the influential and prominent users make news in real time where they share that information with their followers. This connectedness between users and their followers is what makes X so powerful and vital in shaping modern communications. To continue to fulfill its purpose as “the global town square”, X needs diversify its revenue sources away from its reliance on the whims of advertisers and generate a significant portion from its userbase. While subscriptions have been tried, they haven’t yet moved the needle, but there is an alternative model the has been succesfully validated already. This path comes directly from the experience of the video games industry as gaming moved online. The video game business knew that online play was its future and its early attempts at monetization were individual purchases and subscriptions. However, those payment models limited the player base and proved inadequate to all but the largest of games. The advent of free-to-play solved the problem for new entrants as it allowed players to consume the base game for free while relying on a small, but significant core of users to pay for premium features and upgrades to generate revenue for the game. This breakthrough idea caused the industry to turn on a dime to embrace free-to-play because it worked remarkably well for both players and the game publishers. X is similarly situated to take advantage of a move towards free-to-play because like online games its an interactive platform that can leverage its users in a similar manner. I have developed a comprehensive plan outlining how X can smoothly transition to a free-to-play model, introducing two innovative product concepts targeting both core and casual users. Both concepts seem feasible to implement, while also practical for users to understand. What does this mean in concrete business terms? Tens of millions of users will be interested in at least trying out a free-to-play experience on the platform. Upwards of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for X can be generated within a realistic timeline. I understand that you are not directly involved in X’s business, but if you find the prospect of revitalizing X’s revenues by incorporating the free-to-play model on the platform interests you, I welcome the opportunity to discuss these proposals further and address any questions you may have.","output":"Subject: Proposal for Implementing a Free-to-Play Revenue Model at X Dear [Recipient's Name], I am writing to present a proposal concerning X's future strategy in maintaining its status as a platform for free speech and expression. Mr. Elon Musk has commendably committed to upholding these principles despite facing challenges such as advertiser boycotts. In a public statement, he asserted his steadfastness, refusing to yield to any form of coercion while recognizing X's present financial challenges, including its reduced profitability and decreased valuation since its acquisition in the autumn of 2022. Notwithstanding these difficulties, X remains a preeminent social media venue where prominent figures disseminate news and engage with their followers, a testament to its significant role in contemporary communication. To ensure its sustainability as the \\"global town square,\\" it is imperative for X to diversify its revenue streams and mitigate its dependency on advertising by harnessing the financial support of its user base. Previous efforts to monetize through subscription models have not substantially impacted financial outcomes. However, I propose a proven alternative inspired by the successful practices of the online video game industry, which transitioned to an online free-to-play model after recognizing its potential for broader user engagement and revenue growth. This approach offers basic access to all while incentivizing a subset of users to purchase premium features and enhancements. Based on this precedent, I have crafted a detailed strategy for X's transition to a free-to-play model, incorporating two novel product offerings tailored to both dedicated and occasional users. These offerings are designed to be both accessible to our user base and viable for implementation. The anticipated outcome of adopting this model is significant: we can reasonably project the engagement of tens of millions of users and the potential generation of revenue ranging from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars within a practical timeframe. Although you may not be directly involved with X's operations, your insights could be invaluable to this initiative. Should the prospect of reinvigorating X's revenue streams through the free-to-play model intrigue you, I would be delighted to explore these ideas in more detail and respond to any queries you may have. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this proposal with you at your earliest convenience.

As you're aware, Elon Musk has been vocal about his commitment to free speech on the platform, despite facing pressure from advertiser boycotts. He's clear on standing firm, even with the financial hiccups X is going through, including its reduced value post-acquisition last fall. X still has a strong edge – it's a buzzing hub for influencers and news makers. To keep it thriving and independent, it's essential we look beyond ad revenue. Subscription models haven't quite hit the mark yet, but there might be another way forward. Taking a leaf from the video game sector's playbook, which successfully shifted to a free-to-play model, could be our key. This meant gamers could play for free, with the company making money from dedicated players who opted for special features. It was a win-win, expanding the player base and profits. With that in mind, I've put together a plan for X to pivot to a similar model, complete with two fresh product ideas that could resonate with both our everyday and hardcore users. The potential here is huge - imagine tens of millions trying out the new model and the potential to rake in serious revenue. I know this isn't exactly in your wheelhouse, but I thought it might pique your interest. If you're up for a chat about how we can make this happen for X, I'm all ears and would love to get into the specifics with you.

Elon's insistence on not bowing to external pressures, despite the financial dips and the lowered valuation of X since last fall, has set a tenacious example for us all. X's unique position as a real-time news source for key influencers is undisputed. Yet, to secure its future, I believe it's crucial we innovate our revenue model. Moving away from ad dependence hasn't been a home run with subscriptions, so here's a thought—why not take inspiration from the gaming industry's shift to a free-to-play model? It opened the floodgates for gamer engagement and revenue streams by offering the base game for free and monetizing through specialized purchases. Based on this, I've developed a comprehensive plan that aligns with X's interactive nature and could appeal to both our regular and more invested users. It's ambitious yet attainable, with the potential to attract millions of users and convert interest into substantial revenue gains.

X's unique standing as a forum where prominent figures engage with a real-time audience underscores the need for a more robust revenue stream that doesn't rely solely on advertising. Expanding upon this, the adoption of a proven free-to-play model, akin to what transformed the online video gaming industry, presents an intriguing solution.

Considering X's role as a dynamic conduit for influential voices, the exploration of revenue options beyond traditional advertising is necessary.

Use business casual email grammar, but still respectful. I'm reaching out to you because Elon has to his everlasting credit staked out a position that X, formerly Twitter, will remain a platform of free speech and expression despite his critics attempts to harm it through advertiser boycott campaigns. Elon's resolve was best expressed when he said he wouldn't give it to blackmail even though as he acknowledges X is currently unprofitable and its valuation has markedly decreased since he acquired the company in the Fall of 2022 . Yet, X is still in an enviable position due the social media platform being the place where most of the influential and prominent users make news in real time where they share that information with their followers. This connectedness between users and their followers is what makes X so powerful and vital in shaping modern communications. To continue to fulfill its purpose as \\"the global town square\\", X needs diversify its revenue sources away from its reliance on the whims of advertisers and generate a significant portion from its userbase. While subscriptions have been tried, they haven't yet moved the needle, but there is an alternative model the has been successfully validated already. This path comes directly from the experience of the video games industry as gaming moved online. The video game business knew that online play was its future and its early attempts at monetization were individual purchases and subscriptions. However, those payment models limited the player base and proved inadequate to all but the largest of games. The advent of free-to-play solved the problem for new entrants as it allowed players to consume the base game for free while relying on a small, but significant core of users to pay for premium features and upgrades to generate revenue for the game. This breakthrough idea caused the industry to turn on a dime to embrace free-to-play because it worked remarkably well for both players and the game publishers. X is similarly situated to take advantage of a move towards free-to-play because like online games its an interactive platform that can leverage its users in a similar manner. I have developed a comprehensive plan outlining how X can smoothly transition to a free-to-play model, introducing two innovative product concepts targeting both core and casual users. Both concepts seem feasible to implement, while also practical for users to understand. What does this mean in concrete business terms? Tens of millions of users will be interested in at least trying out a free-to-play experience on the platform. Upwards of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for X can be generated within a realistic timeline.

In line with his decision not to yield under pressure, even as X grapples with current unprofitability and a decreased valuation since its acquisition in Fall 2022, I believe there's a compelling way forward for the platform. As X continues to serve as a hub for breaking news and influential discussions, the need to rethink its revenue generation strategy becomes apparent. Moving beyond advertiser reliance is key. Here's where I see an opportunity: the video game industry's shift to a free-to-play model offers valuable insights. This model, which allows free base access while monetizing through premium upgrades, has significantly broadened user engagement and revenue for game developers.

Dentro do contexto da série, ele é um estudante extremamente inteligente e manipulador, capaz de controlar eventos do fundo, sem que os outros percebam sua influência. Ele frequentemente mantém uma expressão impassível e uma atitude calma nas situações mais diversas, o que pode fazer algumas pessoas associá-lo ao estoicismo. No entanto, existem vários argumentos que demonstram que ele não é um estóico no sentido filosófico. O estoicismo é uma escola de filosofia helenística fundada por Zenão de Cítio no início do século III a.C. na Grécia. Os estóicos acreditam no desenvolvimento da autocontrole e fortaleza como um meio de superar emoções destrutivas; eles procuram a sabedoria, sendo alinhados com a natureza e a razão, além de praticar a indiferença para com os estados externos de fortuna e a valorização da virtude. Aqui estão alguns pontos que mostram por que Ayanokoji Kiyotaka não corresponde ao ideal estóico: 1. Ação baseada em motivos pessoais: Os estóicos defendem a virtude como o único bem. Eles agem com base em princípios morais, não em motivos pessoais ou egoístas. No entanto, Ayanokoji often manipula situações e pessoas para alcançar seus objetivos, que nem sempre são virtuosos. 2. Manipulação emocional: Ayanokoji se aproveita das emoções dos outros estudantes para alcançar seus fins, o que é incompatível com a ética estóica que prega respeito pela racionalidade e pelas pessoas como fins em si mesmas. 3. Falta de transparência: Uma característica estóica é o alinhamento com a verdade e a transparência em ações e palavras. Ayanokoji, por outro lado, é frequentemente desonesto e esconde suas verdadeiras intenções. 4. Ausência de comunidade: A filosofia estóica enfatiza a importância da comunidade e a ideia de que todos são parte de uma única polis (cidade) global. Ayanokoji frequentemente age de maneira isolada e não demonstra grande interesse em promover o bem-estar comunitário. 5. Emoções reprimidas: Embora o estoicismo ensine a controlar as emoções em vez de reprimi-las, Ayanokoji frequentemente mostra uma falta de expressão emocional, o que pode ser interpretado como repressão em vez de controle consciente. Esses argumentos são extraídos da interpretação do personagem e de suas ações dentro da narrativa de \\"Classroom of the Elite\\". Por ser um personagem de ficção, sua congruência com qualquer filosofia da vida real será sempre aproximada e interpretativa."},{"instruction":"Qual é a etimologia da palavra Estóico e estratégia","output":"A etimologia das palavras \\"estóico\\" e \\"estratégia\\" remonta à Grécia Antiga: **Estóico:** A palavra \\"estóico\\" vem da palavra grega \\"stoikos\\" (στοικός), que se relaciona com \\"stoa\\" (στοά). A \\"stoa\\" na Grécia Antiga era um tipo de pórtico ou colunata onde as pessoas podiam se reunir. Especificamente, o termo \\"estóico\\" refere-se à \\"Stoa Poikile\\" (Στοὰ Ποικίλη), ou Pórtico Pintado, que era um local em Atenas onde Zenão de Cítio, o fundador do estoicismo, ensinava. Os seguidores da filosofia ensinada por Zenão tornaram-se conhecidos como \\"os homens da Stoa\\", ou \\"stoikoi\\", significando que eles eram seguidores da escola de pensamento associada àquele lugar. **Estratégia:** A palavra \\"estratégia\\" tem a sua raiz na palavra grega \\"strategia\\" (στρατηγία), que significa \\"liderança do exército\\" ou \\"comando\\". É derivada de duas palavras: \\"stratos\\" (στρατός), que significa \\"exército\\", e \\"agein\\" (ἄγειν), que significa \\"liderar\\". Um \\"strategos\\" (στρατηγός) era literalmente um líder do exército ou um comandante. A palavra evoluiu para representar não apenas o ato de comandar os militares, mas também a arte e a ciência de planejar e conduzir operações militares para atingir objetivos mais amplos. Com o tempo, o termo \\"estratégia\\" expandiu-se para além do contexto militar e passou a incluir táticas e planejamento em várias outras áreas, desde negócios e jogos até política e gerenciamento.

A palavra advém do grego \\"stoikos\\", que, como mencionado anteriormente, tem a ver com \\"stoa\\" (pórtico). Etimologicamente, portanto, o significado em português ainda está vinculado ao local original onde o estoicismo surgiu e ao perfil comportamental dos seus praticantes. **Estratégia:** Em português, \\"estratégia\\" significa um plano ou método cuidadosos para alcançar um objetivo particular, que pode ser aplicado em diversas áreas como negócios, esportes, políticas públicas, entre outras. A palavra vem do grego \\"strategia\\", que significa a arte de liderar um exército.

No cotidiano, isso pode ser aplicado ao se preparar para uma entrevista de emprego, planejar uma viagem, ou organizar um orçamento familiar. 2. **Conhecimento do Ambiente e do Oponente:** - O autor defende que é crucial conhecer bem tanto seus próprios pontos fortes e fracos quanto os do seu oponente. No contexto diário, isso significa entender os desafios e a competição que você pode enfrentar em seu trabalho, projeto ou negócio e estar adequadamente preparado para eles. 3. **Flexibilidade e Adaptabilidade:** - A capacidade de se adaptar a situações em constante mudança é essencial. Em situações de vida pessoal ou profissional, ser capaz de ajustar seus planos em resposta a novas informações ou mudanças contextuais pode ser a chave para o sucesso. 4. **Liderança:** - \\"A Arte da Guerra\\" também oferece conselhos sobre liderança, como a importância de ser respeitado e justo. Estes princípios podem ser utilizados em ambientes de trabalho para liderar equipes e projetos de forma eficaz. 5. **Economia de Recursos:** - Sun Tzu adverte contra o prolongamento desnecessário de conflitos, pois isso esgota recursos. Isso se aplica a evitar a procrastinação e o desperdício de tempo, dinheiro e energia em tarefas diárias ou projetos pessoais. 6. **Escolha de Batalhas:** - Não se engajar em todos os confrontos é uma das lições mais conhecidas do livro. No dia a dia, isso significa escolher cuidadosamente quais desafios abordar e quais ignorar, mantendo o foco nas questões verdadeiramente importantes. 7. **Estratégia de Negócios:** - Empreendedores e líderes de negócios muitas vezes empregam táticas de \\"A Arte da Guerra\\" para superar a concorrência, penetrar em novos mercados ou negociar contratos e parcerias. 8. **Desenvolvimento Pessoal:** - Os ensinamentos sobre autoconhecimento e desenvolvimento de virtudes como a paciência e a discrição são relevantes para o crescimento pessoal e profissional. 9. **Resolução de Conflitos:** - Entender o valor de resolver disputas de maneira pacífica e negociar acordos é outra perspectiva que pode ser aplicada em interações familiares, comunitárias ou mesmo legais. \\"A Arte da Guerra\\" é atemporal porque suas lições vão além do campo de batalha, fornecendo insights sobre a natureza humana, o poder de uma estratégia bem elaborada e a importância da inteligência e da previsão no alcance de objetivos a longo prazo, seja em nível pessoal ou coletivo."},{"instruction":"Em Qual Capítulo do Mangá : Kaneki Se aceita como um Ghoull após sua tortura pelas mãos de Jason","output":"No manga \\"Tokyo Ghoul\\", de Sui Ishida, a transformação de Ken Kaneki em um ghoul completo e sua aceitação dessa nova identidade ocorre após sua tortura por Yamori, que é frequentemente chamado de Jason devido à máscara que ele usa, que se parece com a do personagem Jason Voorhees da série de filmes \\"Sexta-Feira 13\\".

For the 4th game, there are 10 questions that have already been used, so there are 90 remaining questions. We need to choose 5 out of these (probability = 90/100 * 89/99 * 88/98 * 87/97 * 86/96). For the 5th game, there are 15 questions that have already been used, so there are 85 remaining questions. We need to choose 5 out of these (probability = 85/100 * 84/99 * 83/98 * 82/97 * 81/96). To calculate the overall probability of not getting a repeat question in all these games, we multiply the probabilities together: Overall probability = (100/100) * (99/100 * 98/99 * 97/98 * 96/97 * 95/96) * (95/100 * 94/99 * 93/98 * 92/97 * 91/96) * (90/100 * 89/99 * 88/98 * 87/97 * 86/96) * (85/100 * 84/99 * 83/98 * 82/97 * 81/96) Simplifying this expression will give you the final probability."},{"instruction":"import os import subprocess import numpy as np import uuid #

The general steps are as follows: 1. Ask the user whether to include subfolders in the video search and store the value. 2. Retrieve video durations for eligible video files that match given extensions (mp4, mkv, wmv, avi). 3. Optionally apply temporal offsets to the analysis based on user preference. 4. For each video, ask the user for the duration of each segment to extract if applying a temporal offset is chosen. 5. Process each video file by: a. Converting video audio to a WAV file. b. Finding the loudest moments in the audio file. c. Extracting video segments around the loudest moments based on the segment duration. 6. Optionally sort the moments (and thus the video segments) according to user preference. 7. Print status messages after processing each video file. Key functions and aspects include: - \`ask_yes_no_question\`: A utility function to ask the user a yes/no question. - \`calculate_loudness\`: Calculates the volume of an audio segment and returns it in decibels. - \`get_video_durations\`: Gets the durations of video files. - \`find_loudest_moments\`: Finds the loudest moments in an audio file. - \`extract_segments\`: Extracts segments of the video file using \`ffmpeg\`. - \`sort_moments\`: Sorts the extracted moments according to loudness or timestamp ordering. - The script uses external libraries such as \`moviepy\` for video editing and \`scipy\` for audio file processing. Please note that the script makes use of \`ffmpeg\` for video manipulation, which means that \`ffmpeg\` must be installed and accessible in the system's path. Also, you need to ensure that \`moviepy\` and other required libraries are installed in the Python environment where you plan to run the script. Given that this is a reasonably complex script, the provided explanation is an overview. There might be more detailed nuances in the script's actual execution and its error handling. Additionally, I've noticed some inconsistencies and potential issues scattered throughout the code, such as the inclusion of uninitialized variables (\`num_moments\`, \`sorting_preference\`) and a possibly outdated section of code that may not run properly. The code likely needs careful review and debugging before usage."},{"instruction":"Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"H:TestsFinalScript Final V4 - avec encodage. - original - automatisé - pic au milieu inchallah 2.py\\", line 269, in <module> moments_to_extract = min(num_moments, max_segments_per_video) NameError: name 'num_moments' is not defined.

Voici la partie pertinente de la fonction \`get_video_durations\` : \`\`\`python def get_video_durations(include_subfolders): video_durations = {} for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.', topdown=True): if not include_subfolders and root != '.': dirs[:] = [] # Ne parcourt pas les sous-dossiers. for file in files: if file.lower().endswith(tuple(video_extensions)): video_path = os.path.join(root, file) # ... (le reste de votre code) ... \`\`\` Dans le code ci-dessus, si \`include_subfolders\` est \`False\`, la logique \`dirs[:] = []\` devrait vider la liste des répertoires que \`os.walk\` prévoit de parcourir par la suite, ce qui empêcherait \`os.walk\` de parcourir les sous-dossiers. Toutefois, cette logique n'est efficace que si \`root != '.'\`, la racine ou le répertoire courant. Cela suggère que le code devrait fonctionner comme prévu. Si le script parcourt toujours les sous-dossiers malgré le fait que \`include_subfolders\` soit défini sur \`False\`, il pourrait y avoir un problème avec la manière dont les variables sont passées ou la condition pourrait être mal exécutée. Vérifiez les points suivants : 1. Assurez-vous que la variable \`include_subfolders\` est correctement définie en fonction de la réponse de l'utilisateur à la question posée par \`ask_yes_no_question\`. 2. Si l'utilisateur sélectionne de ne pas inclure les sous-dossiers (répond \\"2\\"), \`include_subfolders\` doit être défini sur \`False\`. 3. Confirmez que \`get_video_durations(include_subfolders)\` est appelé avec la bonne valeur de \`include_subfolders\`. 4. Assurez-vous qu'il n'y a pas d'autre partie du script modifiant les \`dirs\` après avoir défini \`dirs[:] = []\`. Si ces vérifications sont correctes et que le problème persiste, vous devriez ajouter des instructions d'impression dans la boucle de \`os.walk\` pour voir quels répertoires sont réellement parcourus. Cela peut vous aider à déboguer le problème."},{"instruction":"import os import subprocess import numpy as np import uuid # Import uuid to generate unique IDs from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip from scipy.io import wavfile temporary_audio_files = [] # Define video file extensions and the output folder video_extensions = ['.mp4', '.mkv', '.wmv', '.avi'] output_folder = 'Output' def ask_yes_no_question(question): answer = None while answer not in ('1', '2'): print(question) print(\\"1- Oui\\") print(\\"2- Non\\") answer = input(\\"Veuillez entrer le numéro de votre choix (1 ou 2) : \\").strip() if answer not in ('1', '2'): print(\\"Entrée non valide, veuillez réessayer.\\") return answer == '1' def ask_offset_type(): print(\\"Souhaitez-vous un décalage temporel relatif ou absolu ?\\") print(\\"1- Relatif (pourcentage)\\") print(\\"2- Absolu (secondes)\\") while True: choice = input(\\"Veuillez entrer le numéro de votre choix (1 ou 2) : \\").strip() if choice in ('1', '2'): return choice else: print(\\"Entrée non valide, veuillez réessayer.\\") def get_offset_value(video_duration, offset_type): if offset_type == '1': # Relative offset while True: percent = input(\\"Entrez le pourcentage du temps vidéo à ignorer : \\") try: percent_value = float(percent) return percent_value * video_duration / 100 except ValueError: print(\\"Veuillez entrer un nombre valide.\\") else: # Absolute offset while True: seconds = input(\\"Entrez le nombre de secondes à ignorer : \\") try: return float(seconds) except ValueError: print(\\"Veuillez entrer un nombre valide.\\") def ask_for_segment_duration(allowable_duration): while True: duration = input(\\"Quelle est la durée (en secondes) de chaque segment vidéo à extraire ? \\") try: segment_duration = float(duration) if segment_duration > 0 and segment_duration <= allowable_duration: return segment_duration else: print(f\\"La durée doit être un nombre positif et inférieure ou égale à {allowable_duration} secondes.\\") except ValueError: print(\\"Veuillez entrer un nombre valide.\\") def ask_directory_preference(): print(\\"Souhaitez-vous inclure les sous-dossiers dans la recherche des vidéos ?\\") print(\\"1- Oui\\") print(\\"2- Non\\") choice = input(\\"Veuillez entrer le numéro de votre choix (1 ou 2) : \\") return choice.strip() == '1' # Retourne True si l'utilisateur choisit '1' (Oui), False sinon def calculate_loudness(audio_data): if audio_data.ndim == 1: volume = audio_data.astype('float32') ** 2 else: volume = np.mean(audio_data.astype('float32') ** 2, axis=1) volume_dB = 10 * np.log10(volume + 1e-9) # +1e-9 to avoid log(0) and convert to dB return volume_dB def find_loudest_moments(audio_filename, num_moments, segment_duration, video_duration, starting_offset, ending_offset): rate, audio_data = wavfile.read(audio_filename) # Convert stereo to mono if necessary if audio_data.ndim == 2: audio_data = np.mean(audio_data, axis=1) volume_dB = calculate_loudness(audio_data) segment_half_duration = segment_duration / 2.0 start_index = int(starting_offset * rate) end_index = int((video_duration -

Dans la fonction \`get_video_durations\`, la modification de \`dirs[:] = []\` empêche \`os.walk\` de descendre dans les sous-répertoires, mais cette modification est conditionnée par \`if not include_subfolders and root != '.'\`. La condition \`root != '.'\` empêche l'effacement des sous-répertoires au niveau de la racine. Cependant, cela semble incorrect puisque \`root\` peut ne plus être égal à \`'.'\` après le traitement du premier répertoire. Le problème est que \`os.walk\` continue à partir du répertoire racine et elle génère une paire (root, dirs) pour chaque répertoire dans la hiérarchie. Par conséquent, la condition devrait être ajustée pour s'assurer que la suppression des sous-répertoires est effectuée au niveau approprié. Voici comment vous pouvez ajuster la condition pour empêcher de parcourir les sous-dossiers : \`\`\`python def get_video_durations(include_subfolders): video_durations = {} for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.', topdown=True): # Si l'utilisateur ne souhaite pas inclure les sous-dossiers, nous modifions dirs sur place if not include_subfolders: dirs[:] = [] # Cela empêchera os.walk de descendre dans tous les sous-dossiers # La suite du traitement des fichiers reste inchangée for file in files: if file.lower().endswith(tuple(video_extensions)): video_path = os.path.join(root, file) # ...

Ainsi, si l'utilisateur répond \\"Non\\" à la question sur l'inclusion des sous-dossiers, \`os.walk\` ne parcourra que le répertoire racine. Une autre erreur dans le code se trouve dans la partie où vous configurez les décalages temporels. Il semblerait que vous demandiez et appliquiez ces décalages basés uniquement sur la première vidéo trouvée, sans tenir compte des durées différentes des vidéos individuelles. Pour corriger cela, et s'assurer que vous demandez et appliquez des décalages qui sont spécifiques à chaque vidéo, vous voudrez calculer les valeurs de décalage juste avant de les utiliser pour chaque vidéo dans votre boucle principale. Actuellement, les valeurs saisies pour le premier et le seul fichier sont ensuite utilisées pour toutes les vidéos, ce qui peut conduire à des durées négatives si une vidéo est plus courte que la première. Enfin, notez que le message indiquant la possibilité d'extraire un certain nombre de segments peut inclure également les fichiers de segment précédemment créés, ce qui peut prêter à confusion. Considérez de ne pas afficher les fichiers générés automatiquement par le script lors de l'affichage de ces messages ou d'ignorer ces fichiers lors de la collection des durées vidéo.

Toutefois, il semble y avoir un problème avec la fonction \`find_loudest_moments\`. Cette fonction est censée trouver les \`num_moments\` les plus forts (basés sur le volume) dans la vidéo, mais à la lumière de votre commentaire, il semblerait qu'elle renvoie toujours les mêmes moments. Cela signifie que la vidéo extraite est toujours la même pour chaque segment. Un autre problème potentiel est que les valeurs \`starting_offset_seconds\` et \`ending_offset_seconds\` sont obtenues en utilisant la durée de la première vidéo trouvée, ce qui pourrait devenir problématique si d'autres vidéos ont des durées différentes. Pour diagnostiquer le problème, il faut s'assurer que : 1. \`find_loudest_moments\` fonctionne comme prévu. Il devrait identifier des moments uniques avec les volumes sonores les plus élevés à l'intérieur de la vidéo, sans les dupliquer. 2. \`starting_offset_seconds\` et \`ending_offset_seconds\` devraient être calculés individuellement pour chaque vidéo si des décalages relatifs sont appliqués. Pour un décalage absolu, vous pouvez les demander une fois et les appliquer à toutes les vidéos. 3.

Si les moments ne sont pas uniques, vous obtiendrez des doublons. Vous pouvez ajouter des instructions d'impression pour afficher les valeurs de \`moments\` et assurer qu'ils sont uniques pour chaque appel de \`find_loudest_moments\`. De plus, si vous effectuez un retrait temporel relatif, les offsets de début et de fin doivent être calculés pour chaque vidéo individuellement en fonction de leur durée propre – ce calcul devrait être effectué à l'intérieur de la boucle principale où chaque vidéo est traitée.

Studies have consistently demonstrated that immigrants who are granted citizenship are more likely to participate in civic activities, including voting, volunteering, and running for office. This higher level of engagement strengthens community bonds, enhances social cohesion, and enriches the cultural diversity that is inherent in America's identity. Body Paragraph 2: Driving Economic Growth The automatic granting of citizenship rights to working immigrants benefits the U.S. economy. Immigrants play a crucial role in boosting productivity, entrepreneurship, and innovation. By opening up opportunities for immigrants to become citizens, individuals with valuable skills and talents are incentivized to invest their time, energy, and resources in the United States, leading to a thriving and dynamic economy. Numerous studies have shown that immigrants, regardless of their educational backgrounds, contribute to job creation, drive innovation, and inject vitality into various sectors, including technology, healthcare, and agriculture. Granting citizenship rights to hardworking immigrants is a pragmatic choice that benefits both the newcomers and the American economy as a whole. Body Paragraph 3: Upholding Equality and Justice Automatic granting of citizenship rights aligns with the principles of equality and justice on which the United States was founded. Denying citizenship rights to immigrants who work and live in the country goes against the ideals of fairness and equal treatment under the law. The current immigration system, which often leaves individuals in a state of uncertainty and vulnerability, can create an underclass of workers without proper labor protections or access to essential services. By embracing a policy that automatically grants citizenship rights to immigrants, we ensure that everyone, regardless of their immigrant status, enjoys the same fundamental rights, protections, and opportunities guaranteed to all Americans. Conclusion: Automatic granting of citizenship rights to immigrants living and working in the United States provides numerous benefits, ranging from promoting social integration and driving economic growth to upholding equality and justice. By recognizing the contributions and potential of immigrants, America renews its commitment to its foundational values while securing a brighter future for all. It is imperative that we adopt a more inclusive and equitable approach to immigration, allowing those who work and live here to become citizens with the same rights and opportunities as native-born Americans."},{"instruction":"I liked your essay. However, please change body paragraph 3.","output":"Body Paragraph 3: Fostering a Fair and Just Society The automatic granting of citizenship rights to working immigrants aligns with the principles of fairness and justice that form the bedrock of American society. Denying citizenship rights to immigrants who are already contributing to the country's workforce and society contradicts the ideals of equal treatment under the law. The current immigration system often leaves individuals in a state of uncertainty and vulnerability, creating an underclass of workers without proper labor protections or access to essential services. By embracing a policy that automatically grants citizenship rights to immigrants, we promote a fair and just society that values and recognizes the aspirations, contributions, and dignity of every individual, regardless of their immigration status. Conclusion: Automatic granting of citizenship rights to immigrants working and living in the United States brings forth numerous benefits, including social integration, economic growth, and the fostering of a fair and just society. By acknowledging the contributions and potential of immigrants, the United States not only upholds its foundational values but also drives towards a more inclusive and prosperous future for all. It is crucial to adopt an approach that recognizes the rights and opportunities of immigrants who are already making valuable contributions to their communities, ultimately strengthening the fabric of America."},{"instruction":"اريد مقاله عن الربح من اختصار الروابط","output":"يعتبر اختصار الروابط من الأساليب الشائعة للربح عبر الإنترنت. يتم توجيه روابط طويلة إلى روابط قصيرة وسهلة الاستخدام، مع إضافة عناصر إضافية لتحقيق الأرباح. فيما يلي مقالة تشرح كيفية الربح من اختصار الروابط وتزويدك ببعض الاستراتيجيات والنصائح لتعزيز أرباحك. بدأ الربح من اختصار الروابط أصبح شائعًا في السنوات الأخيرة، حيث ينظر إليه البعض كثغرة لكسب الأموال بسرعة وسهولة عبر الإنترنت. هناك العديد من الخدمات المتاحة عبر الإنترنت التي تسمح لك بتقصير الروابط وكسب الأموال من خلالها، مثل AdFly، وLinkvertise، وShorte.st، وغيرها. تتيح لك هذه الخدمات تحويل الروابط الطويلة إلى روابط قصيرة وتتبع عدد النقرات التي تحصل عليها. لكي تبدأ في الربح من اختصار الروابط، يجب أن تكون لديك حساب في إحدى هذه الخدمات وأن تصبح عضوًا فيها. عادةً ما يكون التسجيل مجانيًا ويمكنك البدء في إنشاء الروابط وتخصيصها. عندما تقوم بتقصير رابط، ستحصل على رابط قصير بالإضافة إلى رابط يحتوي على إعلان. عندما ينقر الأشخاص على الروابط القصيرة، سيتم تحويلهم إلى الإعلان أولاً قبل أن يتم تحويلهم إلى الرابط الأصلي. هناك عدة استراتيجيات لزيادة أرباحك من اختصار الروابط. قد يرغب البعض في مشاركة الروابط القصيرة عبر وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي أو المنتديات، وقد يحقق مكاسب عندما ينقر الآخرون على الروابط ويتفاعلون مع الإعلانات. يمكنك أيضًا إنشاء مدونة أو موقع ودمج الروابط القصيرة في المحتوى الخاص بك. يمكن للزوار النقر على الروابط وتوليد العائدات لك عند تفاعلهم مع الإعلانات. ومع ذلك، يجب الانتباه إلى أن هناك عوامل عديدة تؤثر في نجاحك في الحصول على إيرادات كافية من اختصار الروابط. قد يتطلب الأمر جذب عدد كبير من الزوار أو النقرة على الروابط الخاصة بك لتحقيق أرباح ملموسة. قد لا يكون هذا مضمونًا وقد تكون الأرباح غير مستقرة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يمكن أن يعتبر بعض الناس استخدام روابط مختصرة شكلاً من الإزعاج أو الإزعاج، وقد يتجنبون النقر عليها أو قد يستخدمون أدوات مانعة للإعلانات. باختصار، إذا كنت تبحث عن طريقة سهلة لكسب المال عبر الإنترنت، فقد يكون اختصار الروابط خيارًا لك. إلا أنه يجب أن تكون على علم بقدراتك في جذب المرور وتوليد النقرات على الروابط الخاصة بك. يجب أيضًا أن تكون مستعدًا لتجربة مختلف الاستراتيجيات ومراقبة النتائج لتحقيق أفضل نتائج ممكنة."},{"instruction":"сделай таблицу с данными с сайта https://www.isin.ru/ru/foreign_isin/db/?search=1&page=1 со столбцами ISIN, Наименование эмитента; страна эмитента, Описание выпуска, CFI, Версия стандарта присвоения CFI кода, Состояние ISIN, Нумерующее агентство, Источник информации, По состоянию на","output":"К сожалению, я не могу отобразить таблицу с данными напрямую.

How would the story be affected?","output":"The hypothetical scenario of Alyx Vance dying in Black Mesa while her mother survived would significantly alter the story and characters arcs in the subsequent \\"Half-Life\\" series. Since Alyx plays a central role in \\"Half-Life 2\\" and its episodes, her absence would mean drastic changes to the plot and to Gordon Freeman's journey. Here are some potential impacts on the storyline: 1. A Different Resistance: Alyx is an important member of the human resistance against the Combine. Without her technical skills, resourcefulness, and combat abilities, the resistance would likely be less effective. Other characters might have been introduced or given more prominence in the fight against the Combine. 2. Dr. Eli Vance's Motivation: Much of Eli Vance's motivation comes from protecting his daughter and ensuring a better future for her. If Alyx died and his wife survived, Eli would have different emotional dynamics, potentially affecting his leadership within the resistance. 3. Gordon Freeman's Role: Alyx becomes Gordon's closest ally and companion throughout \\"Half-Life 2\\" and its episodes, assisting him in various missions. Without Alyx, Gordon might have a different companion, or he might operate more independently, which could lead to a lonelier gameplay experience. 4. No Alyx-led Episodes: \\"Half-Life 2: Episode One\\" and \\"Episode Two\\" heavily feature Alyx and her relationship with Gordon. These would either need to be rewritten entirely without her character or replaced with alternate storylines. 5. \\"Half-Life: Alyx\\" Wouldn't Exist: Alyx's own backstory is explored in the virtual reality game \\"Half-Life: Alyx.\\" If Alyx had died in Black Mesa, this game would either not exist or feature a completely different protagonist and storyline. 6. The G-Man's Interests: The G-Man, a mysterious figure in the series, shows particular interest in Alyx. If she were not part of the story, the G-Man's machinations would likely revolve around different characters, altering the underlying narrative of the series. 7. Changes in Technology and Contributions: Alyx contributes significantly to the technological advancements of the resistance, including the development of her \\"pet\\" robot, Dog. The absence of Alyx's inventive contributions might lead to a less technologically advanced resistance. The absence of Alyx Vance from the series would have a butterfly effect on the storyline and the development of other characters. Given her importance to the plot, it's difficult to predict precisely how the story would unfold without her, but it's certain that the \\"Half-Life\\" series as we know it would be profoundly different."},{"instruction":"Tradition ça en latin tu es toujours belle et douce malgré que tu as connue un accident","output":"Traditio, semper pulchra et dulcis es, etiamsi casum passa es."},{"instruction":"В течение, какого срока после увольнения работнику оплачивают больничный лист? социальный фонд","output":"Срок оплаты больничного листа после увольнения работника зависит от правил и норм, установленных в конкретной стране и/или регионе.

Aqui vão alguns princípios básicos e como você pode aplicar isso no dia a dia: 1. **Controlar as emoções:** Os estoicos acham que a gente não deve deixar as emoções mandarem na gente. Em vez de pirar quando algo der errado, tenta ficar tranquilo e entender o que aconteceu. - *Aplicação prática:* Se algo te irrita, respira fundo e pensa antes de reagir, assim você não faz besteira. 2. **Aceitar o que não dá para mudar:** Muita coisa tá fora do nosso controle, tipo o clima ou a opinião dos outros. Os estoicos falam para a gente aceitar isso sem ficar reclamando. - *Aplicação prática:* Se chover no dia do seu rolê ao ar livre, em vez de ficar chateado, arruma um plano B. 3. **Viver no presente:** Preocupar-se com o passado ou o futuro é perda de tempo. O negócio é focar no agora, que é onde a gente pode agir. - *Aplicação prática:* Não fica remoendo o que já foi ou estressando com o que ainda nem rolou. Faz o melhor que puder hoje. 4. **Virtude como bem maior:** Ser uma pessoa boa e justa é o maior objetivo do estoicismo. Isso vale mais do que grana ou sucesso. - *Aplicação prática:* Seja honesto e faça a coisa certa, mesmo quando ninguém tá olhando. 5. **Autossuficiência:** Depender menos de coisas externas e mais de si mesmo para ser feliz. A ideia é encontrar a satisfação dentro de você, e não nas coisas que você tem. - *Aplicação prática:* Não fica esperando comprar o último celular para ser feliz. Aprende a curtir o que já tem. 6. **Reflexão diária:** Os estoicos gostam de refletir sobre suas ações e pensamentos regularmente, para viver melhor. - *Aplicação prática:* No fim do dia, pensa no que você fez de bom e no que dá para melhorar, tipo um balanço do dia. 7. **Universalidade:** Tratar a todos como se fossem parte de uma mesma família ou comunidade global, com respeito e justiça. - *Aplicação prática:* Não importa quem seja, trata todo mundo bem e com igualdade. Colocar essas ideias em prática pode ajudar a viver uma vida mais de boa e com menos estresse."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: Dear winner I am Mr Richard Wahl, the mega winner of 533M In Mega Millions Jackpot, I'm donating to 5 random individuals if you get this email then your email was selected after a spin ball.

Embora a história dos Titãs tenha sido em grande parte explicada, alguns fãs ainda querem saber mais sobre a origem misteriosa e as especificidades do \\"poder dos titãs\\" e como exatamente ele começou. 2. Existem outras populações humanas fora de Paradis e Marley?

Isso deixa algumas dúvidas sobre o alcance e limitações dessas habilidades. 4. Qual era o plano original de Ymir Fritz?

A conexão mística conhecida como \\"Caminho\\" que liga todos os Eldianos é um conceito complexo e pouco detalhado, deixando espaço para interpretação sobre sua natureza exata. 6.

Annie Leonhart é uma personagem cujo destino após os eventos do mangá não é totalmente explorado, deixando os fãs com dúvidas sobre o que aconteceu com ela depois. 7.

Após o fim do mangá, não está claro qual seu status na sociedade ou como foram tratados. 9. Como os eldianos vão conviver com o resto do mundo após os eventos finais?

Маша, понимая, что столкнулась с нечто необыкновенным, приняла предложенную руку и поднялась. \\"Просто устала от рутины, мечтаю о приключениях,\\" — ответила она с улыбкой, о которой не знала, что она может быть такой блестящей. С этой встречи и началось их совместное приключение. Какёин, уже уверенный, что Маша имеет отношение к его поиску, предложил ей стать его спутницей в путешествии по неизведанным дорогам бытия. И Маша, без малейшего колебания, согласилась, ибо в глубине души она всегда знала, что предназначена для чего-то большего. Вместе они отправились в космическое путешествие сквозь порталы реальностей, открывая новые миры и изучая глубины своих сердец. И благодаря своему союзу, они обрели не просто приключения, но и вечную и неразорваемую связь между душами. И хотя сказание о Какёине и Маше было только началом, их истории наполнили страницы бесчисленных фанфиков, где каждый читатель мог по-своему представить, какие волшебные и захватывающие приключения ждут их впереди."},{"instruction":"Какие монгольские слова есть в русском языке?","output":"В русский язык попали некоторые слова в результате многовекового соседства с монгольскими народами, в том числе и в период Монгольского нашествия или так называемого Татаро-монгольского ига. Такие заимствования не так уж многочисленны, и зачастую их происхождение не всегда однозначно, поскольку многие слова пришли через посредство тюркоязычных народов, проживающих на территории Золотой Орды. Вот некоторые из них: 1. **Каган** – титул вождя, который встречается в исторических источниках. Хотя он чаще ассоциируется с тюркскими народами, его использовали и монгольские владыки. 2. **Юрта** – круглая переносная жилища, которые традиционно использовались кочевыми народами Центральной Азии, включая монголов. 3. **Орда** – слово, которое в древнерусском языке обозначало военный лагерь, государство. Происходит от монгольского арду (ordu) или ордон – дворец, лагерь. 4. **Курица** – по одной из версий, это слово могло быть заимствовано во времена Золотой Орды от монгольского слова \\"курь\\" или \\"хурга\\". 5. **Башмак** – обувь, возможно, происходит от монгольского \\"бац\\" – обувь. 6. **Калым** – встречается в русском языке в значении приданого или выкупа за невесту. Возможно, заимствовано от монгольского слова \\"халам\\" – подарок, свадебный дар. Следует помнить, что многие слова, которые могли быть заимствованы в период средневековья, могли со временем измениться или выйти из употребления, поэтому точное количество и происхождение таких слов определить сложно. Кроме того, некоторые слова, пришедшие из монгольского, могли восходить к тюркским корням, так как монгольские и тюркские народы на протяжении веков взаимодействовали и заимствовали друг у друга различные элементы языка."},{"instruction":"Это всё не то","output":"Прошу прощения за неудовлетворительный ответ. Вот некоторые примеры слов русского языка, которые считаются заимствованиями из монгольского языка, включая период Золотой Орды: 1. **боярин** – возможное заимствование от монг. бугед (багадур) – воин, герой; впоследствии в Русском государстве так стали называть представителей высшего слоя дворянства. 2. **дача** – от монг. дахь – налог; изначально указывала на земельный участок, предоставленный в пользование за службу или в счёт платы налогов. 3. **лама** – от монг. лама – жрец; в русском языке иногда используется для обозначения буддийского священнослужителя. 4. **сараи** – от монг. сарай – дворец; в русском языке термин для обозначения крупного торгового города или поселения времён Золотой Орды. 5. **табун** – от монг. табуун – стадо лошадей; в русском языке также означает стадо лошадей. 6. **аркан** (от монг. аргамчин – лассо) – верёвка с петлей на конце для ловли животных. 7. **бозон** - в русском языке слово означает «кострище; мусорная свалка», однако в монгольском оно означает \\"хлам; руины; мусор\\". Культурные и языковые влияния между народами зачастую сложны и многослойны. Например, многие слова, которые считаются монгольскими заимствованиями, могли быть также тюркского происхождения или доходить до русского через тюркские языки. Также, со временем некоторые из этих слов могли изменить своё первоначальное значение или утратить связь с первоначальным монгольским термином."},{"instruction":"Create me 100 random village, town or city names for a RPG game, include a description or each and what it is known for","output":"Here are 100 random village, town, and city names for an RPG game, along with a brief description of each and what they are known for: 1.

I understand the fact that you may or may not be a relative of my late client Mr. Derrick Thompson McCaffrey but please read carefully as I explain in detail why I contacted you. I am Mr. Eric Gillet- Esq Retired Partner. I worked with CMS DeBacker International Law Firm for 45 years but now retired. I am an attorney to Mr. Derrick Thompson McCaffrey, my late client died in a car crash with his immediate family and left behind a deposit of Fifteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Euro with a bank here in Belgium. I have not contacted you on the premise that I believe you to be a relative of my deceased client; my contacting you was due to personal discretionary policy so there are no reasons why I should have rather contacted all other persons with the same last name. Although there are lots of people with the same last name as yourself, I found and chose you from professional and personal endeavour which required me to contact both the U.S. Embassy here in Belgium and the Bureau of Data and Statistics which helped with a comprehensive list of individuals bearing the same last name. From the list I was able to conduct a genealogical analysis wherein the result on your name showed up as inconclusive and thus was a yardstick for my approaching you. However, this by no means implies you’re definitely related to my deceased client but rather a deal to successfully argue your relationship status with my deceased client. My message to you is a final option for me because of the circumstances surrounding this claim right now. Mr. Derrick Thompson McCaffrey was an oil merchant and he had oil dealings around Europe and Africa. He died at 54 alongside his wife, Olivia, 46, and their two daughters, Katharine, 19 and Yolanda 15. He lived the last of his years here in Belgium but travelled often to the United States. I served as his private finance attorney for the last Eight years preceding his death. Mr. Derrick migrated to Belgium a long time ago. After the death of my late client, I was informed by the finance company to get any member of his extended family to put up a claim for his deposited funds with them due to his demise with his entire immediate family. However, it might interest you to know that, after a thorough investigation on the finance company, I found out that some members of the company are currently planning to divert this funds in their selfish interest and only want to use the excuse that since I am unable to get someone to make the claim, the money should be made serviceable and that means reverting the funds to the Government while the company retains a percentage of it. On this note I decided to search for a credible person and finding that you bear a similar last name, I was urged to contact you, that I may, with your consent, present you to the organization (company) as my late client's surviving family member so as to enable you put up a claim in that capacity as a next of kin of my client. I had to conduct a genealogical analysis wherein the result on your name showed up as inconclusive and this was the yardstick used by me to approach you. However, this by no means implies you’re certainly related to my deceased client but rather a deal to successfully argue your relationship status with my deceased client. I have at my possession some very important legal documents that might be requested by the bank and can only be provided by my office. There is a legal reason for the confidentiality of this transaction because of its nature. I could be held for being in breach of a standard code of conduct of lawyer/client fiduciary relationship.

Voici où placer chaque morceau de code dans vos fichiers : 1. Dans le fichier \`TicketCard.tsx\`, ajoutez \`DateSelection\` et \`initialDateSelection\` pour définir le type des données de sélections de dates, ainsi que l'état initial. \`\`\`tsx // TicketCard.tsx interface DateSelection { '20Juillet': boolean; '21Juillet': boolean; '22Juillet': boolean; } const initialDateSelection: DateSelection = { '20Juillet': false, '21Juillet': false, '22Juillet': false, }; \`\`\` 2.

La fonction \`handleDateChange\` peut être définie soit au niveau local dans le composant \`TicketCard\` soit dans un fichier de conteneur parent où vous gérez les données qui sont passées aux \`TicketCard\` en tant que props, selon la structure de votre application et la manière dont vous souhaitez gérer l'état global. Si vous souhaitez que ces fonctionnalités soient disponibles dans plusieurs composants et que vous entretenez l'état global de l'application, utilisez le Context API, Redux, ou un autre gestionnaire d'état global pour partager les fonctions et les données entre les composants.

It's likely that the function is defined in a separate file, and it has not been imported into \`TicketCard.tsx\`. 2. **Error 2345**: This error message explains that the object being used to set the state is not matching the \`DateSelection\` interface expected by \`useState\`. This is because of the way you're attempting to update the state—it seems you have extra properties on your state update object that should not be there. Let's address these issues one by one: # Regarding the first error (Cannot find name 'setCookie'): You need to import the \`setCookie\` function into your \`TicketCard.tsx\`. Assuming that this function is defined in the same file that contains \`getCookie\` and \`removeCookie\`, you should add an import statement at the beginning of \`TicketCard.tsx\`. For example: \`\`\`tsx import { setCookie } from '../../path_to_your_cookie_functions'; \`\`\` Replace \`../../path_to_your_cookie_functions\` with the relative path to the actual file where \`setCookie\` is defined. # Regarding the second error: The issue is with this line where you're updating the state: \`\`\`typescript const updatedSelection = { dateSelection, [dateKey]: !dateSelection[dateKey] }; setDateSelection(updatedSelection); \`\`\` The correct way to update the state while ensuring that the object matches the \`DateSelection\` interface is: \`\`\`typescript const updatedSelection = { ...dateSelection, [dateKey]: !dateSelection[dateKey] }; setDateSelection(updatedSelection); \`\`\` By spreading \`...dateSelection\`, you copy existing state properties, and then you update only the property \`[dateKey]\` with the new value. Here is the corrected function \`handleDateChange\` with the consideration that \`setCookie\` has been imported correctly, and the state is being updated appropriately: \`\`\`tsx const handleDateChange = (dateKey: keyof DateSelection) => { setDateSelection(prevState => ({ ...prevState, [dateKey]: !prevState[dateKey] })); // Grab the updated state to set the cookie. // Since state updates may be asynchronous, it's a common pattern // to use the callback form of the setter function to ensure you have the latest state. setDateSelection((prevState: DateSelection) => { const updatedState = { ...prevState, [dateKey]: !prevState[dateKey] }; setCookie('dateSelection', updatedState, { expires: 7 }); return updatedState; }); }; \`\`\` With these fixes, you should no longer encounter TypeScript errors related to \`setCookie\` and incorrect state object structures.

Alyx is initially friendly and personable towards Gordon, quickly establishing a rapport with him. If the change in her character was due to shyness or intimidation because of Gordon's legendary status, this would add a layer of character development and storytelling that might unfold as follows: 1. **Initial Interactions**: Early in their partnership, Alyx would remain formal and reserved. Her dialogues would be focused on mission objectives, strategies, and providing information to Gordon about the Resistance's efforts against the Combine. Players might notice Alyx's reluctance to engage in small talk or personal conversations due to her nervousness around the \\"legend\\" she has heard so much about. 2. **Gradual Change**: Over time, as Alyx and Gordon face challenges together, she would observe his actions, his commitment to the cause, and how he interacts with others, which might start to break the ice. Her admiration for Gordon's legend would begin to blend with respect for the man himself. Through cooperative tasks and shared experiences, Alyx's demeanor could gradually become warmer and the professional façade might start to crack, revealing more of her genuine personality. 3. **Turning Point**: A specific event or moment of vulnerability might serve as a catalyst for Alyx to open up to Gordon. For instance, a close call in battle or an emotional revelation about her past and her father, Eli Vance, might prompt Alylyx to show her true feelings and drop the professional distance. 4. **Deepening Relationship**: As Alyx becomes more comfortable around Gordon, the shift in their relationship would be palpable. Not only would their in-game conversations become more personal and playful, but their teamwork would also reflect a more synchronized and trusting partnership. Alyx's shyness would give way to her true, spirited and resourceful nature as seen in the original story. 5. **Narrative and Gameplay Impact**: This change in Alyx's character arc would affect the overall narrative and possibly the gameplay. The player might be introduced to new dialogue options, character-driven missions, or even mechanics that rely on the evolving trust and camaraderie between Gordon and Alyx. Ultimately, such a character development for Alyx Vance would provide players with a more nuanced and evolving understanding of her character, making her growth and her relationship with Gordon a more central part of the gaming experience. It would highlight themes of hero worship, the weight of expectations, and the power of personal connections during a rebellion. However, it's important to note that this is a speculative interpretation and not the established narrative in the Half-Life series."},{"instruction":"How would the voice acting for Alyx sound during this character arc.","output":"Voice acting plays a crucial role in conveying character development and emotions in video games. For Alyx Vance's character arc involving a transition from a stoic and professional demeanor to showing her true, more personable self, the voice acting would need to reflect these subtleties and changes over time. If we imagine this arc for Alyx, here's how her voice acting might be approached at different stages: 1. **Initial Stoic Professionalism**: In the beginning, Alyx's voice would be more formal, controlled, and perhaps slightly detached. She would speak clearly and confidently, but without much inflection or warmth. Her focus would be on mission details, safety protocols, and tactical information. There would be a notable effort to maintain a certain level of decorum around Gordon Freeman. 2. **Hints of Personality**: As the game progresses, the voice actor would start incorporating small, subtle changes in tone that hint at Alyx's underlying personality. This might include moments of hesitation, a softening of her voice when showing concern for Gordon, or slight fluctuations in pitch when she's excited or nervous about the tasks ahead. These nuances hint at the character's depth without fully revealing her true nature yet. 3. **Relaxed Interaction**: When Alyx begins to feel more comfortable around Gordon, the voice acting would reflect this by allowing more natural speech patterns to emerge. Conversations would start to flow more comfortably, with a greater range of emotional expression. The voice actor would imbue Alyx with warmth, humor, and maybe even moments of playful teasing, signaling the shift in her relationship with Gordon. 4. **Vulnerability and Growth**: Key moments that require Alyx to be more open or vulnerable would demand a broader emotional range from the voice actor. Scenes where Alyx reflects on personal loss, her fears, or even admits her initial intimidation by Gordon's legend, would be delivered with genuine emotion. A catch in the voice during sad moments, a laugh during lighter ones, or the steadiness of resolve when confronting adversity could all showcase Alyx's multi-dimensional character. 5. **Fully Realized Character**: As Alyx's character arc matures, her interactions with Gordon would be fully representative of her actual personality. The voice acting here would be dynamic and rich, reflective of the established rapport between them. The voice actor would perform with ease and familiarity, indicative of her newfound comfort and trust in Gordon. Throughout this character arc, Merle Dandridge, the actress who voices Alyx Vance in the Half-Life series, would utilize her range and talent to convey the character's emotional journey. Dandridge's performance would need to be nuanced to effectively depict Alyx's transition from a reserved professional to a confident, genuine ally, pulling players deeper into the story and their connection with Alyx."},{"instruction":"Write some natural, subtle, in character dialogue lines for Alyx, when she is stoic and professional at first.","output":"Certainly!

With all the stories you hear about him, I guess I thought he'd be different—more untouchable, I suppose.\\" Resistance Member: \\"Really? So he's not the silent, crowbar-swinging mythical hero we all thought?\\" Alyx: \\"Well, he's definitely got skills with that crowbar, don't get me wrong. But there's more to him. He listens, he cares... He's just... so real. In a good way. And when you're facing impossible odds, feeling real is very reassuring.\\" **[Gordon Approaches]** Resistance Member: \\"Hey, look who's coming.\\" Alyx: *(Hearing footsteps, quickly shifts tone)* \\"—which is precisely why we can't afford any slip-ups. The Combine is relentless. We must remain focused and alert at all times.\\" Gordon: \\"Alyx?\\" Alyx: \\"Dr. Freeman! I was just briefing our friend here on the importance of maintaining our operational security. Ready to move out?\\" In this dialogue, the shift in Alyx’s demeanor is apparent as Gordon comes into earshot.

When it comes to the exfoliation of sodium titanate, silver nitrate can play a significant role. Exfoliation refers to the process of separating the layers of a material to obtain individual sheets or thin structures. In the case of sodium titanate, exfoliation can be achieved by treating it with silver nitrate. The exfoliation of sodium titanate with silver nitrate typically proceeds as follows: 1. Sodium titanate, a layered material, is immersed in a solution containing silver nitrate. 2. The silver ions (Ag+) from the silver nitrate interact with the sodium titanate structure, causing the layers to separate. 3. The resulting exfoliated material consists of individual titanate sheets with silver ions incorporated into their structure. This exfoliation process has several potential applications, such as the production of thin films or nanosheets for use in electronics, catalysis, energy storage, or sensors. The incorporation of silver ions into the titanate structure can also result in enhanced material properties or specific functionalities. It is worth noting that the specific conditions and parameters of the exfoliation process may vary depending on the desired outcome and the specific characteristics of the sodium titanate material. Experimental optimization and characterization methods are crucial for achieving the desired exfoliation quality. Overall, silver nitrate can be utilized effectively in the exfoliation of sodium titanate, offering opportunities for the development of novel materials with unique properties and applications."},{"instruction":"what is this setting for on a pid temperature controller , why would i need a low limit if i''m heating something to 800C for example","output":"On a PID temperature controller, the \\"low limit\\" setting is used to establish the minimum temperature threshold at which the heating system should operate. It ensures that the temperature does not drop below the specified lower limit. While it may seem counterintuitive to have a low limit setting when heating something to a high temperature like 800°C, there are several reasons why it can still be useful: 1. Preventing damage: Some materials or processes may be sensitive to temperature variations, even at high temperatures. Having a low limit helps avoid sudden drops in temperature that could potentially damage the material or disrupt the process. 2. Safety considerations: In certain applications, maintaining a minimum temperature is necessary for safety reasons. For instance, if the system involves flammable substances or requires the constant presence of heat to prevent freezing, a low limit can provide an added layer of safety. 3. Control stability: PID controllers work by adjusting the heating output to maintain the desired temperature setpoint, even in the presence of external disturbances. Having a low limit ensures that the controller consistently receives a meaningful temperature signal within its operating range. This helps maintain stable and accurate control, even during system startup or temporary fluctuations. It's important to note that while the low limit ensures the temperature does not drop below a certain value, it does not interfere with the heating process if the setpoint is above that limit. The controller simply ensures that the temperature remains within the designated range. In summary, even in high-temperature applications, setting a low limit on a PID temperature controller can provide protection, maintain stability, and address safety concerns during heating processes."},{"instruction":"does silver doped tio2 suffer from photo-corrosion ? the silver part that is","output":"Silver-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) can exhibit enhanced photocatalytic properties compared to pure TiO2 due to the presence of silver ions or silver nanoparticles. However, the stability of silver in TiO2 under light-induced conditions, known as photo-corrosion, can be a concern. Silver is prone to undergoing photo-corrosion in the presence of light and oxygen. This photo-corrosion process can lead to the dissolution of silver ions or the aggregation and eventual loss of silver nanoparticles from the TiO2 matrix. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of the silver-doped TiO2 material may degrade over time. Several factors influence the extent of photo-corrosion in silver-doped TiO2, including the concentration of silver dopants, the specific synthetic method used, the surface area, and the conditions in which the material is utilized. Adjusting these factors can help to minimize the photo-corrosion effects. To mitigate photo-corrosion, researchers have explored various strategies, such as coating the silver-doped TiO2 surfaces with protective layers, using stabilizing agents, or optimizing the synthesis conditions to promote stronger interaction between silver and TiO2. It is crucial to carefully consider the application requirements and environmental conditions when utilizing silver-doped TiO2 materials. For some applications, such as photocatalysis or solar energy conversion, it may be necessary to take preventative measures against photo-corrosion to ensure the long-term stability and performance of the silver-doped TiO2 material."},{"instruction":"for exfoliation of sodium titanate is DMSO used to sweel the intercalations ?","output":"Yes, Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is commonly used as a swelling agent in the exfoliation of sodium titanate. DMSO has excellent solvent properties and can effectively penetrate the interlayer spaces of layered materials like sodium titanate. By swelling the intercalations, DMSO helps separate the layers and facilitate the exfoliation process. The interaction between DMSO and the sodium titanate structure leads to the insertion of solvent molecules between the layers, causing expansion and subsequent separation. The expansion facilitates the exfoliation, allowing for the isolation of individual titanate sheets or the formation of nanosheets with increased surface area. DMSO is preferred as a swelling agent due to its high solvating power, low boiling point, and ability to penetrate interlayer spaces. It also has relatively low toxicity and is compatible with many organic and inorganic materials, making it suitable for various exfoliation processes. However, it is important to note that the choice of swelling agent can depend on specific research or application requirements. Other solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) or water can also be used for the purpose of exfoliating sodium titanate, but DMSO is widely used due to its effectiveness. It is recommended to optimize the exfoliation parameters and solvent concentration to achieve the desired results."},{"instruction":"tell me the ammonium exfoliation compounds most commonly used for sodium titanate exfolliation i forget the names","output":"The two commonly used ammonium exfoliation compounds for the exfoliation of sodium titanate are tetraalkylammonium hydroxide (TAAH) and tetraalkylammonium salts. TAAH, specifically tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), is frequently employed in the exfoliation process. These compounds have a high affinity for sodium titanate and can effectively intercalate between the layers, leading to the separation and exfoliation of individual titanate sheets. Tetraalkylammonium salts, such as tetraalkylammonium bromide or tetraalkylammonium chloride, are also used for sodium titanate exfoliation. These salts act as intercalating agents and can swell the interlayer spaces, facilitating the exfoliation process. The specific choice of ammonium compound depends on factors such as the desired level of exfoliation, the targeted application, and the compatibility with other materials in the system. It is worth mentioning that the exfoliation of sodium titanate using ammonium compounds typically involves a combination of solvent, temperature, and reaction time optimization to achieve the desired degree of exfoliation. The selection of appropriate exfoliation conditions is essential for obtaining high-quality and well-dispersed titanate nanosheets."},{"instruction":"no it was like TEA or something","output":"I apologize for the confusion. The compound you may be referring to is Tetraethylammonium (TEA). Tetraethylammonium salts, such as Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), can indeed be used for the exfoliation of sodium titanate. TEA is an organic ammonium compound that can intercalate between the layers of sodium titanate, promoting the exfoliation of individual titanate sheets. Similar to other ammonium compounds, TEA can swell the interlayer spaces and facilitate the separation of the layers. TEA has been utilized in the exfoliation process of various layered materials, including sodium titanate, to obtain nanosheets or thin films. Again, I apologize for any confusion caused earlier. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) is indeed an ammonium compound used for the exfoliation of sodium titanate."},{"instruction":"how is Tetraethylammonium made","output":"Tetraethylammonium (TEA) is typically synthesized through a reaction between ethylamine and ethyl bromide. The process involves the quaternization of ethylamine with ethyl bromide to form the desired TEA compound. Here is a general overview of the synthesis procedure: 1. Equip a reaction flask with a condenser and a reflux setup. 2. Add a calculated amount of ethylamine to the reaction flask. 3. Slowly add ethyl bromide to the reaction flask while maintaining a controlled temperature and reflux conditions. 4. Allow the reaction mixture to reflux for a specific period, typically several hours, to facilitate the quaternization reaction. This reaction transforms the ethylamine into tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr), with the bromide replacing one hydrogen atom on each of the nitrogen atoms. The chemical equation representing the synthesis of TEA from ethylamine and ethyl bromide is as follows: C2H5NH2 + 4 C2H5Br → [(C2H5)4N]Br + 4 HBr 5. Once the reaction is complete, the resulting tetraethylammonium bromide can be isolated through various separation techniques such as filtration or crystallization. The compound can be further purified if necessary. The obtained tetraethylammonium bromide can then be used as a precursor for the generation of other tetraethylammonium compounds, such as tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), by subsequent reactions or modifications. It is important to note that this is a general overview, and actual synthesis procedures may involve variations in reaction conditions, starting materials, and purification methods based on specific requirements and protocols."},{"instruction":"ahhh i see , which is a Tetraalkylammonium salt with the alkyl being methyl ethyl or butyl , etc","output":"A Tetraalkylammonium salt refers to a compound where the alkyl groups are substituted with alkyl chains.

Tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) or chloride (TPACl): This compound has four propyl (C3H7) groups as the alkyl substituents. These are just a few examples of Tetraalkylammonium salts, and it is possible to substitute the alkyl groups with other alkyl chains like pentyl, hexyl, and so on. Tetraalkylammonium salts find applications in various fields, including as phase transfer catalysts, electrolytes in batteries, and in organic synthesis. The specific properties and applications of these salts depend on factors such as the alkyl chain length and the counter ion (bromide, chloride, etc.) used."},{"instruction":"ok is there something which isnt a bromide , i dont like bromine much lol","output":"Certainly! Tetraalkylammonium salts can be synthesized with various counter ions other than bromide. Some common alternatives include chloride, nitrate, acetate, sulfate, and perchlorate. Here are a few examples: 1. Tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl): The counter ion for this salt is chloride (Cl-). 2. Tetraethylammonium acetate (TEAAc): In this case, the counter ion is acetate (CH3COO-). 3. Tetrabutylammonium nitrate (TBAN): The counter ion is nitrate (NO3-). 4. Tetrapropylammonium sulfate (TPAS): In this compound, the counter ion is sulfate (SO4^2-). These are just a few examples to illustrate the possibility of using different counter ions in Tetraalkylammonium salts. The choice of counter ion depends on the specific requirements of the intended application and the properties desired for the salt. By choosing a different counter ion, you can avoid using bromine while still obtaining the desired Tetraalkylammonium salt. It's important to note that the properties and solubility of the salt could vary depending on the counter ion selected."},{"instruction":"ok any how are these made , just a quick run down of ingerdients is fine","output":"Certainly! Here is a brief rundown of the ingredients commonly used for the synthesis of Tetraalkylammonium salts: 1. Alkyl halide: This serves as the source of the alkyl group in the final salt. Examples include methyl bromide, ethyl chloride, butyl iodide, etc. 2. Amine: A primary or tertiary amine is used as the starting material to react with the alkyl halide. Examples include methylamine, ethylamine, or a more complex amine like butylamine or propylamine, depending on the desired Tetraalkylammonium salt. 3. Counter ion precursor: This is the source of the desired counter ion for the salt. For example, you may use sodium bromide to obtain a bromide salt or silver nitrate to obtain a nitrate salt. 4. Solvent: A suitable solvent is chosen to facilitate the reaction and dissolve the reactants. Common solvents include ethanol, methanol, or other organic solvents, depending on the reactants' nature and solubility. The general synthesis process involves mixing the alkyl halide with the amine and allowing them to react under appropriate conditions, such as heating or stirring. This reaction results in the substitution of the halide group with the alkyl group, forming the quaternary ammonium compound. The final step involves adding the counter ion precursor to obtain the desired Tetraalkylammonium salt. This can be achieved by adding the appropriate salt or by an ion-exchange reaction, depending on the specific precursor and desired salt. The reaction progress and completion can be monitored using various analytical techniques, such as NMR spectroscopy or chromatography. It's important to note that the specific reaction conditions and procedures may vary depending on the desired Tetraalkylammonium salt and counter ion. The synthesis should be performed following established protocols or literature methods to achieve the best results."},{"instruction":"are these any good for exfoliation of sodium titanate ? 1. Tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl): The counter ion for this salt is chloride (Cl-). 2. Tetraethylammonium acetate (TEAAc): In this case, the counter ion is acetate (CH3COO-). 3. Tetrabutylammonium nitrate (TBAN): The counter ion is nitrate (NO3-). 4. Tetrapropylammonium sulfate (TPAS): In this compound, the counter ion is sulfate (SO4^2-).","output":"The effectiveness of Tetraalkylammonium salts for the exfoliation of sodium titanate depends on various factors, including the specific properties of the salt and the desired outcome. Here are some considerations for the salts you mentioned: 1. Tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl): TMACl is commonly used as a quaternary ammonium salt in various applications, including exfoliation processes. However, for sodium titanate exfoliation, TMACl may not be as effective compared to other salts. Chloride ions can potentially compete with the insertion of intercalants into the titanate layers, leading to reduced exfoliation efficiency. 2. Tetraethylammonium acetate (TEAAc): TEAAc has been successfully used in the exfoliation of various layered materials. Acetate ions can serve as effective intercalants to promote the separation of titanate layers. However, it is important to optimize the concentration, reaction conditions, and solvent compatibility to achieve desired exfoliation results. 3. Tetrabutylammonium nitrate (TBAN): Nitrate ions have shown potential for the exfoliation of sodium titanate. TBAN can swell the interlayer spaces and facilitate exfoliation. However, the alkyl chain length and steric effects of TBA may require careful optimization to achieve efficient exfoliation. 4. Tetrapropylammonium sulfate (TPAS): Sulfate ions have been utilized as intercalants in the exfoliation of various layered materials. TPAS can potentially promote the separation of titanate layers. However, the alkyl chain length of TPA may affect its ability to intercalate efficiently, so optimization is crucial. It is important to note that the specific exfoliation efficiency of Tetraalkylammonium salts may depend on various parameters, including the concentration of the salt, reaction conditions, solvent choice, and the specific characteristics of the sodium titanate material used. Experimentation and optimization are often required to achieve the desired exfoliation quality. Additionally, alternative exfoliation techniques and intercalation agents may also be explored for sodium titanate exfoliation."},{"instruction":"is there any iodate versions that are used for the same purpose , i'll make one up , Tetraethylammonium iodide","output":"Yes, Tetraethylammonium iodide (TEAI) can indeed be used for exfoliation purposes, including the exfoliation of sodium titanate. Tetraethylammonium iodide consists of four ethyl (C2H5) groups attached to the ammonium ion, with iodide (I-) as the counter ion. TEAI can be synthesized by reacting ethylamine with ethyl iodide"},{"instruction":"What there was an Easter egg in hl2, where the player can find the body of a combine assassin, which looks A lot like Alyx.","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff date of early 2023, there is no known Easter egg in Half-Life 2 where the player can find the body of a Combine assassin that looks a lot like Alyx Vance. Alyx is a central character in the Half-Life series, and in Half-Life 2, she acts as an ally to the main protagonist, Gordon Freeman. The Combine assassins, also known as \\"female assassins\\" or \\"black ops,\\" are a cut enemy type from the final release of Half-Life 2. They were a successor to the original assassins from Half-Life 1, known as \\"black ops,\\" but were ultimately removed from Half-Life 2 during development. Models and concept art of these Combine assassins can be found within the game's files and in various documented materials, which has fueled speculation and fandom discussions. There are many Easter eggs, hidden secrets, and cut content in the Half-Life games that have been documented by the fan community, but this specific Easter egg involving a Combine assassin resembling Alyx is not recognized as part of the Half-Life 2 game. This could be based on misinformation or be a conflated detail from unofficial mods or fan creations where various modifications or custom content related to the Half-Life universe are often made. However, it's always possible that new Easter eggs or hidden secrets are discovered by fans, but as of the last update, there is no widely recognized Easter egg of this nature in the official Half-Life 2 game."},{"instruction":"What if there was though? How would players react?","output":"If there were an Easter egg in Half-Life 2 where players could find a body resembling Alyx Vance as a Combine assassin, the discovery would likely cause a significant reaction within the Half-Life community for several reasons: 1. **Surprise and Curiosity:** Given that such an Easter egg would have remained hidden for so many years after the game's release, its discovery would surprise players and the gaming community. It would lead to a surge of curiosity about how it eluded detection for so long and speculation about its meaning within the game's lore. 2. **Lore Implications:** Fans of the Half-Life series are deeply invested in the story and characters. Finding an Easter egg that suggests a character like Alyx has a doppelgänger or somehow has ties to the Combine would lead to intense lore analysis and theory crafting. Players would look for clues to fit this revelation into the established narrative or as a hint to alternate storylines that were never developed. 3. **Community Engagement:** The Half-Life modding and Easter egg hunting communities would likely become very engaged in exploring the game to understand the context of this Easter egg. They might search for additional secrets, comb through the game's code, or look for related content in the game's resources. 4. **Developer Insight:** There would be calls for developers to comment on the discovery. Players would want to know the intent behind the Easter egg, why it was added, and what it means for the overall Half-Life universe. If Valve or former developers provided some insights, it could give players more context or help solve the mystery. 5. **Publicity and Renewed Interest:** Coverage from gaming news outlets and YouTubers would likely increase public awareness of the discovery, resulting in renewed interest in Half-Life 2. This could lead to more people playing the game again or for the first time to experience the Easter egg themselves. 6. **Impact on Spinoff Materials:** The revelation could influence fan fiction, art, and discussions about non-canonical narratives within the Half-Life world. It might even inspire modders to create new content or storylines based on this hypothetical scenario. In summary, the discovery of such a significant Easter egg would result in a mix of shock, excitement, and a flurry of investigative activity from both fans and content creators. It would become a hot topic of discussion and could even influence how people interpret the characters and story of the Half-Life series."},{"instruction":"Where in the story could this Easter egg be found?","output":"As the Easter egg you're describing is hypothetical and does not actually exist in Half-Life 2, we can only speculate on where it might be found if it were part of the game. Game developers place Easter eggs in various locations—sometimes in hidden or hard-to-reach areas, or within normal gameplay paths but disguised in a way that requires keen observation or interaction. Here are some possible scenarios on where such an Easter egg might be located within the narrative structure of Half-Life 2: 1. **City 17:** Early in the game, among the dystopian streets and apartments. The Easter egg could be hidden inside a concealed room or behind a destructible wall that players wouldn't normally think to explore without a clue or hint. 2. **Ravenholm:** Within the creepy and deserted town, possibly in one of the abandoned buildings or at the end of a seldom-traveled alley, encouraging the players to explore it despite the dangers posed by the headcrab zombies. 3. **Nova Prospekt:** A Combine-controlled prison facility with many cells and interrogation rooms. The Easter egg could be discovered in a sealed-off area that's off the main path of the player's journey, perhaps revealed after solving a complex puzzle or by following cryptic hints. 4. **The Citadel:** The heart of the Combine's operations could be a suitable place for a compelling Easter egg. As players progress through the technological fortress, they could stumble upon a hidden lab or chamber containing the Easter egg, hinting at the darker experiments the Combine might conduct. 5. **Resistance Outposts:** During the sections of the game where Gordon interacts with the Resistance, the Easter egg could be subtly integrated into the background or secret areas of these locations, such as hidden chambers or behind movable objects. Regardless of location, the Easter egg you're imagining would likely be in an area that resonates with the significance of the reveal. It might be in a spot that requires the players to diverge from the main storyline or execute a sequence of actions that would not be typically performed during normal gameplay. Such placement ensures that the Easter egg remains undiscovered by most players until someone meticulously searches every corner of the game world or until developers give a hint that prompts a community-wide hunt."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): сколько будет времени спустя 5 часов","output":"Если сейчас \\"Пусто\\" (что я интерпретирую как отсутствие конкретного текущего времени), то не могу предоставить точный числовой ответ на ваш вопрос.

Below is an example of a simple weapon switching script written in C# for Unity: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class WeaponSwitcher : MonoBehaviour { // Assuming your weapons are setup as children of the GameObject to which this script is attached public int selectedWeapon = 0; void Start() { SelectWeapon(); } void Update() { int previousSelectedWeapon = selectedWeapon; if (Input.GetAxis(\\"Mouse ScrollWheel\\") > 0f) { if (selectedWeapon >= transform.childCount - 1) selectedWeapon = 0; else selectedWeapon++; } if (Input.GetAxis(\\"Mouse ScrollWheel\\") < 0f) { if (selectedWeapon <= 0) selectedWeapon = transform.childCount - 1; else selectedWeapon--; } if (previousSelectedWeapon != selectedWeapon) { SelectWeapon(); } } void SelectWeapon() { int i = 0; foreach (Transform weapon in transform) { if (i == selectedWeapon) weapon.gameObject.SetActive(true); else weapon.gameObject.SetActive(false); i++; } } } \`\`\` Here's a breakdown of what each part of the script does: 1. The \`selectedWeapon\` variable keeps track of the current weapon selected. 2. The \`Start\` method calls \`SelectWeapon()\` at the beginning to ensure that the correct initial weapon is active. 3. The \`Update\` method listens for mouse scroll wheel input. When it detects scrolling, it updates the \`selectedWeapon\` index. Make sure that your Input settings in Unity have \\"Mouse ScrollWheel\\" set up. 4. The \`SelectWeapon\` method deactivates all the weapons and then activates the one at the current \`selectedWeapon\` index. To use this script: 1. Attach this script to a parent GameObject which contains all the weapons as child GameObjects. 2. Make sure each of your weapons (child GameObjects) has an associated script that disables their functionality when the GameObject is disabled. This way, when you switch weapons and deactivate one, it won't continue to operate. 3. The update cycle in this script uses the mouse scroll wheel to switch weapons. You can modify the input detection to use keyboard inputs or buttons as desired, by adjusting the \`if\` conditions in \`Update()\` to listen for different inputs. Always test and adjust the script to match the specifics of your game's design and your weapons' setups. Remember, while this is a simple and straightforward weapon switching script, depending on the complexity of your game and how weapons interact with your game logic, you may need a more complex system handling different states, ammunition, weapon-specific behaviors, etc."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: Good morning Cameron McCaffrey How are you doing hope great.

Adipose tissue contains an enzyme called aromatase, which converts testosterone and other androgens into estrogen. So, the more adipose tissue a person has, the more potential there is for estrogen to be produced in this manner. This is why individuals with higher body fat percentages, particularly in the case of obesity, may have higher levels of estrogen. This process does not start or stop at a specific body weight threshold. Instead, it occurs continuously, and its impact on hormone levels can vary based on the amount of body fat, as well as other factors like age, sex, overall health, and individual hormonal balance. It's also worth noting that estrogen is not the only hormone produced or influenced by body fat; leptin, insulin, and other hormones are also affected by adipose tissue. If an individual loses a significant amount of body fat through diet, exercise, or other means, the aromatization process may decrease, potentially leading to lower estrogen levels. However, the endocrine system is highly complex, and changes in hormone levels due to weight loss or gain should be discussed with a healthcare professional for a clear understanding of individual circumstances."},{"instruction":"ask me questions on what choices i would make if i was the leader of the first french republic.","output":"As the leader of the First French Republic, what choices would you make regarding the government structure and system? 1.

Here are some choices you could make as the leader of the First French Republic: 1. Economic Policies: - Implement policies to promote industrialization and economic growth, or prioritize the redistribution of wealth to address social disparities. - Encourage free trade and open markets, or establish protectionist measures to protect domestic industries. - Introduce a progressive tax system to ensure a fair distribution of wealth. - Invest in infrastructure projects to improve transportation and stimulate economic development. 2. Political Structure: - Establish a centralized government with a strong executive power, or promote a more decentralized system with power distributed among local authorities. - Adopt a presidential system or a parliamentary system of governance. - Implement strict term limits for elected officials, or allow for longer terms to provide stability. - Create a new constitution that guarantees individual rights and freedoms, or maintain a more authoritarian approach to maintain order. 3. Education and Culture: - Make education accessible to all citizens through compulsory and free education, or allow for private education with a focus on meritocracy. - Promote the French language and culture, or encourage diversity and respect for different regional identities. - Prioritize funding for scientific research and technological advancements, or invest in arts and humanities to preserve and promote cultural heritage. 4. International Relations: - Pursue a policy of neutrality and non-intervention in external conflicts, or actively engage in alliances and coalitions. - Advocate for revolutionary ideals and support revolutionary movements in other countries, or focus on maintaining stability and peaceful relations with other nations. - Prioritize diplomacy and negotiation, or be more assertive in asserting French influence and interests. 5.

The focus on redistributing wealth, implementing protectionist measures, and introducing a progressive tax system suggests a concern for reducing economic inequality and promoting social welfare. This aligns with some aspects of the Jacobin faction during the French Revolution, which aimed to tackle social disparities. 2. Opting for a decentralized system, parliamentary government, and strict term limits for elected officials indicates a desire for power-sharing and a focus on democratic principles. This aligns with some elements of the Girondin faction, which sought to maintain a balance between centralized authority and local autonomy. 3. Prioritizing compulsory and free education, diversity, and scientific research suggests an emphasis on knowledge and progress, which aligns with the ideals of the Enlightenment philosophers influential during the French Revolution period. 4. A preference for alliances, support for revolutionary movements, and assertiveness in asserting French influence indicates a nationalist inclination, similar to the ideas championed by both the Jacobin and Girondin factions during the French Revolution. 5. Addressing poverty, promoting gender equality, and advocating for a secular society reflect a concern for social justice, equality, and a separation of church and state. These values were shared by various factions during the French Revolution, such as the Jacobins and the Montagnards. Overall, the leader's ideology appears to draw inspiration from different factions of the French Revolution, combining aspects of both the Jacobins and the Girondins."},{"instruction":"what are some differences in belief.","output":"While the leader's ideology may have some similarities to different factions of the French Revolution, there are also some notable differences in belief: 1. Economic Policies: The focus on redistribution of wealth and protectionist measures may be more aligned with the Jacobin faction, which sought to address social inequality. However, the emphasis on a progressive tax system reflects a more moderate approach, as the Jacobins were known for advocating for direct taxes on wealth and property. 2. Political Structure: The choice of a decentralized system and a parliamentary government aligns with the Girondin faction's preference for a balance of power between central and local authorities. However, the strict term limits for elected officials may differ from the Girondins, as they were known to support longer terms to ensure stability and continuity. 3. International Relations: While the leader's preference for alliances and support for revolutionary movements may be similar to the Jacobin faction's ideals, their assertive approach in asserting French influence may diverge from the Jacobins' more idealistic and revolutionary stance. 4. Social Reforms: The leader's advocacy for addressing poverty, promoting gender equality, and a secular society align with progressive ideals shared by various factions during the French Revolution. However, the specific policies and approaches chosen may differ from those of the main factions, as the French Revolution was characterized by diverse perspectives and opinions. These differences suggest that the leader's ideology is not a direct replica of any specific French Revolution faction, but rather represents a unique blend of ideas that could have been influenced by various factions and adapted to the specific circumstances of the First French Republic."},{"instruction":"ask me questions on what choices i would make if i was the leader of confederate states on america.","output":"As an AI language model, I'm committed to promoting positive and unbiased dialogue.

Zde je několik tipů, jak se kvalitně vyspat: 1. Vytvořte si rutinu: Jděte si vždy do postele a vstávejte ve stejnou dobu, i o víkendech. Tím napomůžete regulovat svůj spánkový cyklus. 2. Vytvořte si vhodné prostředí: Ujistěte se, že máte tichou, temnou a chladnou místnost, která vám umožní relaxovat a snadno usnout. Použijte rolety nebo závěsy, abyste minimalizovali světlo, a odstraňte veškerý hluk. 3. Vyhněte se stimulujícím látkám: Omezte příjem kofeinu, alkoholu a nikotinu, zejména před spaním. Tyto látky mohou negativně ovlivnit kvalitu spánku. 4. Vytvořte si relaxační rituál před spaním: Například si přečtěte knihu, poslouchejte klidnou hudbu nebo se osprchujte teplou vodou. Tímto způsobem si zklidníte mysl a připravíte se na spaní. 5. Omezte používání elektroniky: Před spaním minimalizujte používání chytrých telefonů, tabletů a televize. Modré světlo ze zařízení může narušovat produkci spánkového hormonu melatoninu. 6. Pohybujte se pravidelně: Fyzická aktivita může pomoci zlepšit kvalitu spánku. Ale vyvarujte se cvičení příliš blízko k odpoledni nebo večeru, protože to může být příliš stimulující. 7. Sledujte, co jíte a pijete před spaním: Těžké, nadměrné nebo mastné jídlo před spaním může způsobit neklidný žaludek a potíže se spánkem. Místo toho sáhněte po lehčích, snadno stravitelných potravinách. 8. Zvážte využití přírodních prostředků: Existuje několik přírodních prostředků, které mohou pomoci zlepšit spánek, jako například bylinné čaje nebo oleje s esenciálními oleji. 9. Vyhněte se dlouhým odpoledním spánkům: Pokud potřebujete odpočívat během dne, snažte se omezit jejich délku na 20-30 minut. Delší spánky mohou narušit spánkový cyklus a způsobit problémy s usínáním večer. 10. Pokud trpíte dlouhodobými problémy se spánkem, obraťte se na svého lékaře: Pokud se často cítíte vyčerpaní nebo přetížení a máte problémy se spánkem po delší dobu, je vhodné se poradit s lékařem nebo specialistou na spánek, aby vám mohl poskytnout vhodné rady nebo doporučení."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!
