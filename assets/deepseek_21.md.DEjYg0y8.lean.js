The economy has taken a hit with the equity market on the Nairobi Stock Exchange losing a staggering 591 million on the first day of 2008. Business leaders are also concerned that the government is losing 29.5 million a day in revenues due to the turmoil. The thriving tourism industry in Kenya has also been dealt a blow. British tour operators have called off flights, leaving the once-popular industry struggling to stay afloat. The situation in the country has raised safety concerns, discouraging tourists from visiting the country. Political instability has been cited as the main cause of this economic downfall. The disputed election has led to violent clashes, and the political tension shows no sign of easing. This has left many businesses struggling to stay afloat, with some even closing down completely. The Kenyan government must prioritize restoring stability to the country to prevent further economic damage. Business leaders are urging the government to take decisive action to address the key issues behind the unrest. A peaceful resolution to the political crisis is necessary to breathe life back into the economy and the tourism industry. The world is watching Kenya as it faces these challenges.

All the deepocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean.

The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial breakup of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup.

This will induce an additional current in the antenna element, changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna. Changing the antenna's height by a quarter wavelength, then changes the phase of the reflection by 180°, with a completely different effect on the antenna's impedance.

Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a fulllength runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects takeoff procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced takeoff load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself. What is the answer to this question: What design feature do aircraft carriers feature to aid in launching and recovering aircraft?","output":"Aircraft carriers feature a flat-top flight deck to aid in launching and recovering aircraft."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Obama touts manufacturing gains at a steel plant in Indiana.

All the taunting, namecalling, and not knowing is something I, like most other young feminine boys, will always remember, and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay.

To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, to the Hindu Kush mountains in what is now Afghanistan. The empire was established by Chandragupta Maurya in Magadha (in modern Bihar) when he overthrew the Nanda Dynasty. Chandragupta's son Bindusara succeeded to the throne around 297 BC.

The crisis began on January 16, 2013, when militants linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) attacked a gas facility near In Amenas in eastern Algeria. The militants took hundreds of workers hostage, including 132 foreign nationals from over 20 countries. The hostage takers demanded the release of Islamist prisoners and an end to French intervention in Mali. The Algerian government refused to negotiate with the militants and instead launched a military operation to end the crisis. After a four-day siege, the military stormed the facility, resulting in the deaths of 38 hostages and 29 militants. While there have been other high-profile hostage situations involving tourists and resort workers, such as the 2002 Bali bombings and the 2015 attack on the Sousse beach resort in Tunisia, the number of hostages in those situations was significantly lower.

However, her meeting with then-Prime Minister David Cameron proved to be awkward. The visit was meant to strengthen UK-German relations, but instead, tensions rose. When Merkel arrived at No 10 Downing Street, there was a sense of unease in the air. As soon as the two leaders shook hands, it was clear that there was something wrong. Reports suggest that Cameron was frustrated with Merkel's handling of the Eurozone crisis and was hoping for more support from Germany.

The awkwardness of the meeting was visible to everyone in attendance. After the meeting, there was little indication that any progress had been made in UK-German relations.

Even after cutting thousands of jobs, increasing taxes, and reducing pensions for public workers, the city still owes more than 18 billion, and its future is uncertain. One potential source of revenue that officials have considered is selling assets owned by the city, including the art collection housed in the Detroit Institute of Arts. The DIA's collection is home to over 60,000 works of art, including priceless masterpieces from some of the world's most renowned artists. However, the city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has asked for a detailed inventory of the art to assess its value, causing an outcry from many who are worried about its possible sale. Local residents and art enthusiasts have rallied to the defense of the museum, arguing that selling off the collection would be a short-sighted solution that could irreparably harm Detroit's cultural heritage. Many have also voiced concerns about the potential loss of jobs if the museum were to close or significantly scale back its operations. Despite the concerns raised by many, a spokesman for the emergency manager has issued a statement saying that a sale of the art collection is not currently being planned. However, the possibility of selling the collection remains a topic of discussion among city officials, leaving many to wonder about the fate of Detroit's cultural treasures. In the end, the fate of the art collection in the Detroit Institute of Arts remains uncertain. Although officials have denied plans to sell it, the ongoing budget crisis in the city means that all options must be considered.

For an extra boost, heat your curler gently with a hairdryer before using – just make sure it's not too hot!

To ensure that your gardenia plants thrive, it is essential to plant them correctly and provide them with the proper care. Here are some steps that you can follow to plant and care for your gardenia plants. 1. Water the spot where you're planting the gardenia: Before planting your gardenia, it is crucial to water the soil thoroughly. This will help the plant establish strong roots and ensure that it receives the necessary moisture to thrive. 2. Dig a hole as deep as the root ball of the gardenia and twice as wide: The hole for your gardenia should be dug as deep as the root ball of the plant and twice as wide. This will ensure that the plant has enough room to grow and establish strong roots. 3. Set the gardenia in the hole: Place the gardenia in the hole and gently press the soil around the plant's base. Make sure that the plant sits at the same depth it was in the container or ground. 4. Mulch around the gardenia's base: Mulching around the base of your gardenia will help keep the soil moist and cool. Apply a layer of mulch, such as bark, wood chips, or pine needles, around 2-3 inches thick, but not touching the plant's base. 5. Keep the gardenia watered: Gardenias need to be kept moist but not waterlogged. Water your gardenia deeply, but infrequently to promote root growth. Water your gardenia when the top few inches of soil are dry. 6. Fertilize once a month during spring and summer: Fertilize your gardenia once a month with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season. This will help provide the plant with the necessary nutrients to produce healthy foliage and flowers. 7. Prune the gardenia: Pruning your gardenia will help it maintain shape and promote healthy growth. Prune your gardenia after it has finished blooming by removing any dead or diseased wood. 8. Look for signs of pest infestation: Gardenias are prone to pest infestations, such as whiteflies or mealybugs. Look for signs of pest infestation, such as yellowing leaves or sticky residue on the leaves, and treat with a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap. By following these simple steps, you can help ensure that your gardenia plants thrive and produce beautiful blooms for years to come."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: front, palace, statue","output":"The front of the palace features a magnificent statue."},{"instruction":"The explosion, while killing one of the Cossacks and seriously wounding the driver and people on the sidewalk, had only damaged the bulletproof carriage, a gift from Napoleon III of France.

One of the best ways to cook a steak is by using a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. To begin with, make sure to coat the skillet with a high-heat oil to prevent the steak from sticking. It is recommended to cook one steak at a time to ensure that the heat is distributed evenly. Once you have placed the steak on the skillet, let it cook for about 4-6 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the steak. To flip the steak over, use tongs or a fork, and avoid using a spatula as it can pierce the steak and cause the juices to escape. After cooking on both sides, you can lower the heat and finish cooking the steak to your desired doneness. This is especially important if you want a medium or well-done steak. By lowering the heat, the steak can cook evenly, allowing the flavors to develop perfectly. In conclusion, cooking a steak in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat is a great way to achieve a perfectly cooked steak with a crispy exterior and juicy interior.

The study found that in the first three years of marriage, the divorce rate for couples in a covenant marriage was 1.3% compared to 6.9% for couples in a standard marriage. - Covenant marriage requires couples to complete premarital counseling and to make a commitment to each other that is harder to break. This can lead couples to take their marriage more seriously and to work harder at maintaining it, which can ultimately prevent hasty divorces. - By requiring couples to agree to limited grounds for divorce, covenant marriage eliminates the option of divorce for reasons such as \\"irreconcilable differences\\" or \\"mental cruelty.\\" This can discourage couples from seeking a divorce unless there is a clear and compelling reason to do so, which can prevent hasty and impulsive decisions to end the marriage. - States that have implemented covenant marriage laws have seen lower divorce rates overall.

However, let's look at some averages to get an idea of what we might expect. In the NFL, the average length of a field goal is around 36 yards. This means that if the team kicks a field goal on their first possession, we can expect them to gain around 36 yards. On the other hand, the length of a touchdown can vary greatly depending on the play. A short run or pass could result in a touchdown as short as 1-2 yards, while a long bomb could result in a touchdown of 50 yards or more. However, the average touchdown length in the NFL is around 20 yards. So, if the team scores a touchdown on their first possession, we can expect them to gain around 20 yards. Adding these two figures together, we get a total of approximately 56 yards gained. Again, it's important to remember that this is just an average and the actual number could be higher or lower depending on the specific game. Ultimately, the length of the first field goal and first touchdown will depend on the skills of the players involved, the strategies employed by the teams, and a variety of other factors."},{"instruction":"Australian media are reporting today that doubts have been raised about the ages of Chinese medal winning athletes as long ago as the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000 .

Some people prefer simply to follow an individual's selfdefinition or identity.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Time appears to have a direction—the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an arrow of time, and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no proper time: the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above.

Look for products that are formulated for your hair type, whether it's dry, oily, or normal. You may need to experiment with different products before finding the one that works best for you. In addition to using the right hair care products, it's important to take care of your hair by avoiding heat as much as possible. High temperatures can damage your hair and lead to breakage and split ends. Try to air dry your hair whenever possible and avoid using hot tools such as hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons. Regular haircuts are also crucial for keeping your hair healthy. Trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to prevent split ends and promote healthy growth. This will also help to maintain the shape of your hairstyle and prevent it from becoming dull and lifeless. While it's important to take care of your hair, it's also important to embrace your hair's natural style. Rather than trying to force your hair into a certain style or texture, work with what you have and try to enhance it. This will not only make your hair look its best, but it will also be easier to maintain. Finally, a balanced diet can also contribute to healthy hair. Make sure to eat a diet that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein, as these nutrients are essential for healthy hair growth. Drinking plenty of water can also help to keep your hair hydrated and looking its best. In conclusion, taking care of your hair may require some effort, but the results are worth it.

To do this, simply divide the numerator by the denominator, and the resulting number is the decimal equivalent of the fraction. This method is particularly useful when comparing fractions or performing arithmetic operations. Another useful technique when working with fractions is finding equivalent fractions. To do this, divide both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number. This will produce a fraction with the same value but different numerator and denominator. Finding equivalent fractions can be helpful when adding or subtracting fractions, as it allows for easier manipulation. Reducing fractions to their lowest terms is also important when working with fractions. To do this, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor. This will result in a fraction with the smallest possible numerator and denominator while still maintaining its value. Reducing fractions to their lowest terms is particularly helpful when working with larger numbers, as it allows for simpler arithmetic operations and easier comparison of fractions. In summary, when working with fractions, it is important to know how to convert them into decimal numbers, find equivalent fractions, and reduce them to their lowest terms.

For one thing, getting around becomes a nightmare, which is especially true when your Sat Nav decides to stop working. It's frustrating and can sometimes leave us feeling helpless. But, Sat Navs aren't the only thing we rely on these days. In fact, sometimes, it's the little things that can cause the most problems. Like, for instance, losing your false teeth. It's not something we want to admit, but as we age, our memory can start to fail us. And, if you're someone who wears dentures, losing them can be a real problem. So, what do you do when you can't find your false teeth? The best thing to do is to retrace your steps and think about where you might have left them. Moving on to another common problem, what happens when you need to go out of town and bring your furry friend with you? But, what happens when you can't take your dog with you and need a dog-minder?

In 2020, married couples living together accounted for 50.8% of all households in the United States, while households made up of individuals accounted for 27.2%. This significant difference can be attributed to various factors, including the prevalence of traditional family structures and societal norms that favor getting married and starting a family. Additionally, there are various financial and practical benefits to living with a partner, such as shared expenses and responsibilities. It is worth noting that while married couples living together are the largest group for households, there has been a steady increase in households made up of individuals over the years. This trend can be attributed to various factors, such as changing social norms, delayed marriage, and an increasing number of single-person households.

With the stress levels skyrocketing, it is essential to find some peace and calm for mental well-being. Meditation can easily help provide relief to the tired mind and body, leading to better focus, productivity, and health. To begin your meditation practice, it is necessary to lay a solid foundation and prepare accordingly. To start, it is recommended to search for videos or apps for guided meditation. There are numerous options available online, and it is a good idea to research and find those that resonate with you. Before beginning, it is advised to avoid any consumption of food for at least half an hour as it can affect the meditation experience. The environment plays a vital role in the process of meditation. It is essential to find a quiet place where you can meditate undisturbed. Even a few minutes of meditation can be helpful, but minimizing external stimuli helps to focus better. Finding a comfortable, seated position is the next step in creating a safe and comfortable environment. The position should align the body correctly to assist with breathing and posture. Resting hands lightly on the lap can often help bring comfort while preventing fatigue or discomfort. Once your posture is stable, ensure your spine is straight, and your gaze is relaxed. The position of the spine affects the flow of energy in the body and can aid in deeper, more focused breathing. Similarly, the eyes should relax, either closed or open, gazing gently downwards to reduce any visual distractions. With everything in place, begin to focus on yourself. Start by becoming aware of physical and emotional feelings. Take note of thoughts or sensations present when beginning meditation. Letting go of these thoughts and focusing on the breath helps ease the mind. Finally, focus on breathing, and try to regulate the breath so that it is slow and steady. This is the most critical part of meditation, and it should be your primary focus for the duration of the practice. It is important to remember that meditation is a personal experience, and everyone's practice will be different. Practice meditation every single day. Combining each of these steps and finding a routine that works for you will eventually lead to a powerful and effective meditation practice. With consistent practice, it can be life-changing in the most positive way."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

Be aggressive and anticipate players coming down the field. Attack every ball that comes at you. Save shots on goal using your hands and feet.","output":"When it comes to playing soccer, there are a handful of key strategies that will help improve your performance on the field. The first and perhaps most important of these is to pay close attention to the game. Keep an eye on the ball at all times and be aware of what's happening around you. This will help you anticipate plays and make quick decisions when it matters most. Another essential strategy is to communicate with your teammates. Whether you're shouting out instructions or simply offering a word of encouragement, good communication can make all the difference in a fast-paced game like soccer. It helps to build a strong sense of teamwork and ensures that everyone is on the same page when it comes to tactics and strategy. Being aggressive is another important aspect of playing soccer. This doesn't mean being reckless or dangerous, of course, but rather taking the initiative and taking charge of the game. This can involve aggressively anticipating plays and positioning yourself to intercept the ball, or making bold moves that catch your opponents off guard. One of the most critical skills for a soccer player is knowing how to attack every ball that comes their way. Whether you're playing defense or offense, you need to be ready to react quickly and aggressively to any opportunity that arises. This means being alert and focused at all times and taking advantage of any chance to make a play. Finally, a good goalkeeper needs to know how to save shots on goal using their hands and feet. This takes a combination of athleticism, agility, and finely-tuned reflexes. It's an essential skill for any soccer player, but particularly for those who are tasked with protecting the goal and preventing the other team from scoring. In conclusion, playing soccer is all about being prepared, alert, and ready to respond quickly to changing conditions on the field. By paying close attention to the game, communicating with your teammates, being aggressive, attacking every ball, and knowing how to save shots on goal, you'll be well on your way to becoming a standout player in this exciting and challenging sport."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: In heraldry what colour is azure","output":"Azure is a blue colour in heraldry."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

One team of researchers in the United States has recently turned to Google Earth to gain a better understanding of one of these tribes.

Wet hair can be heavy and weigh down your roots, making it difficult to achieve volume. Once your hair is dry, it's time to apply a root lifter and volumizing mousse. A root lifter is a styling product that is specifically designed to add volume to the roots of your hair. To apply, simply spray the product onto your roots and massage it in with your fingers. Be sure to focus the product on your crown and the back of your head for added lift. Next, apply a volumizing mousse to your hair. This will help to add body and fullness throughout your locks. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, making sure to pay extra attention to the ends. A little bit goes a long way with mousse, so start with a small amount and work your way up as needed. Once your hair is styled and voluminous, you'll want to make sure to maintain the look throughout the day. Avoid touching your hair too much, as this can cause it to become flat and lifeless. Instead, use a light-hold hairspray to set your style in place and keep your voluminous look intact. In conclusion, achieving voluminous hair is easier than you might think.

The new law defines low income as people who make less than half the area's median income of 32,000, and stipulates that those getting free weed must have a medical marijuana card or referral from a doctor.

However, in recent years, the BBC has found a way to laugh at itself through the satirical comedy series W1A. The show stars real-life BBC boss, Alan Yentob, and the beloved Downton Abbey actor, Hugh Bonneville. Bonneville plays the character Ian Fletcher, who is hired as the head of values and strategy at the BBC after the corporation's recent mishaps. The show serves as a clever commentary on the inner workings of the broadcasting company and how it handles public scrutiny. Through its witty writing and sharp humor, W1A highlights the absurdity of the bureaucratic practices that plague the BBC. The show's title is a reference to the postcode of BBC Broadcasting House's administrative headquarters in London. As the name suggests, the show takes a behind-the-scenes look at the workings of the corporation, pointing out the issues within the organization. Whether it's the infamous Jimmy Saville scandal or the controversial Lord McAlpine allegations, W1A takes these scandals head-on and pokes fun at the way in which the BBC has dealt with them. It's a refreshing take on how one of the world's most respected broadcasting companies can use humor to highlight its shortcomings. In conclusion, W1A is a brilliantly timed comedy that serves to poke fun at the BBC's scandals while simultaneously being a love letter to the organization. It's an excellent example of how satire can be used to shine a light on serious issues, making it a must-watch for anyone interested in the world of broadcasting."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: With the increase in global temperatures, many regions around the world are facing water scarcity and drought.

This can help expose your blog to a wider audience. Original content is key when it comes to standing out on Tumblr. While it may be tempting to reblog content from others, the most successful blogs create their own unique posts. This can include anything from art to writing to photography. Consistency is important when it comes to blogging. Try to post at least once a day, or even multiple times a day if you can.

Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.

Love took action by arming her 11-year-old son with two steak knives, which has led to her being arrested by police. The incident took place in Love's home, where her daughter was spending time with friends. Love walked in on the boy and quickly reacted by taking matters into her own hands. However, arming a child with knives is not an appropriate way to handle a dangerous situation. Love's actions have understandably raised concerns about her judgment and the safety of her children. The use of weapons in any form is dangerous and can cause fatal incidents. Parents should prioritize the safety of their children by seeking help from the government’s child protective services or local law enforcement agencies. Handling such threatening situations alone can put both the children and their guardians at risk. Parents should also educate their children about their personal safety and how to react to potentially dangerous situations so that they may not be vulnerable to dangers such as the one Honey Love faced. In summary, Honey Love's reaction to the situation she encountered was not appropriate.

In order to determine how many points the Buccaneers scored, it is necessary to specify which particular game or season one is referring to. For instance, in their most recent game, which was Super Bowl LV held in February 2021, the Buccaneers played against the Kansas City Chiefs and defeated them with a score of 31-9. Therefore, the Buccaneers scored 31 points in that particular game. Similarly, if one was referring to a different game or season, the number of points they scored would be different. It is also important to note that in American football, there are different ways to score points. A touchdown, worth six points, is scored when a team crosses the opponent's goal line with the ball or catches a pass in the end zone. After scoring a touchdown, the team can either attempt to kick a one-point conversion or try for a two-point conversion by running or passing the ball into the end zone again. A field goal, worth three points, is scored by kicking the ball through the opponent's uprights from anywhere on the field. Lastly, a safety, worth two points, is scored when the opposing team is tackled with the ball in their own end zone. In conclusion, the number of points that the Buccaneers scored depends on the specific game or season being referred to. In Super Bowl LV, the Buccaneers scored 31 points, but for any other game, it is necessary to specify which particular game is being referred to in order to determine the number of points the team scored."},{"instruction":"Question 1: Corporate Espionage: Does China have one creative idea of their own?

This statistical analysis includes all regular season games and does not include any playoff or championship games. The 34 rushing touchdowns were scored by a variety of players and teams throughout the season, with some teams showcasing multiple players who scored such touchdowns. It is worth noting that rushing touchdowns of this length are quite rare in the NFL, as they require both quick footwork and exceptional speed. Additionally, the defense must also fail to counteract the offense's efforts. Therefore, when a player scores such a touchdown, it is often celebrated as a significant moment in the game and in the player's career. Rushing touchdowns of over 50 yards in length are also essential points for a team, helping them close the gap or widen their lead. In some cases, these touchdowns can be the turning point of a match, bringing the team back from a losing position or solidifying their position at the top.
