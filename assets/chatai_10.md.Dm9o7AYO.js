The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field, Ampère's force law, was discovered later by AndréMarie Ampère in 1820. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A freehanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.

The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer.

Remove the food from the oil and place it on a drying rack.","output":"Frying food can be a delicious and easy way to cook a variety of meals. To get started with this process, you need to make sure you have the necessary equipment, including a deep fryer and enough oil to submerge your food. Once you are ready, it is essential to follow these instructions to ensure that your food is cooked to perfection. First, pour the oil into the deep fryer when it is off and cool. You need to make sure that you have enough oil to fully cover your food without overflowing the fryer. Once you have added the oil, turn on the fryer and allow it to heat up to a temperature of between 325-375°F (163-191°C). This temperature range will help ensure that your food cooks evenly while also retaining its flavor. After you have heated up the fryer, it is time to prep your food. Pat your food dry to ensure that there is no excess moisture on the surface. This is an essential step because any leftover water will cause the oil to splatter and potentially result in burns. Once your food is dry, slowly dip it into the fryer. It is important to do this slowly to prevent any splatters or potential accidents. Make sure that you place your food in the oil gently, so it does not break apart or disturb the temperature of the oil. Fry your food until it has a golden brown exterior. This may take anywhere from a few minutes to several minutes depending on what you are cooking. It is important to keep an eye on your food while it cooks to ensure that it does not burn. Once your food is cooked, remove it from the oil and place it on a drying rack. This will allow any excess oil to drip off, resulting in a crispier finish. Overall, frying food is a delicious and widely used cooking method. By following these instructions, you can ensure that your food is cooked properly and safely. So, next time you are in the mood for some crispy and golden fried food, grab your deep fryer and get cooking!"},{"instruction":"it possible to conclude that There is a group of people and a black dog in a living and dining room, some sleeping some eating. if A dog is watching a group of people.?

These lower rates can significantly reduce the amount of interest accrued each month and help those in debt to pay off their balances faster. But how do you avoid finding yourself in debt in the first place? According to experts, it is important to use no more than 10 percent of your available credit.

The boarding of Jenkins's vessel, on the other hand, happened in 1731, almost 20 years before the treaty was signed. The incident involved British captain Robert Jenkins and his ship, the Rebecca. Jenkins claimed that a Spanish patrol boat boarded his vessel and cut off his ear as a warning not to smuggle goods in Spanish territory. This incident, along with other conflicts between the two nations, led to the War of Jenkins' Ear in 1739. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was a significant event in European history. It not only ended the War of Austrian Succession, but it also established the balance of power between the participating nations. The treaty also led to the return of several territories that were seized during the war. It was instrumental in setting the stage for stability and peace in Europe during the mid-18th century.

The Oireachtas even issued a press release insisting such expenses could only be used for travel within a politician’s constituency, not outside – and that they would have to return the money.

Claims made by Joel Rudin, lawyer for man wrongfully convicted of murder. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Brooklyn's former District Attorney Charles Hynes is facing accusations of misconduct in his office's handling of witnesses in criminal trials. Joel Rudin, a lawyer for a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder, claims that Hynes's office held witnesses in locked hotel rooms and stripped them down to their underwear. These allegations shine a light on possible unethical behavior within the district attorney's office. According to Rudin, witnesses were held against their will in hotel rooms for days with no way to leave or contact family members. This was allegedly done to keep them away from defense attorneys and ensure their cooperation with the prosecution's version of events. Stripping the witnesses down to their underwear was seen as a way to prevent them from escaping or hiding any evidence that could be used against them. These accusations are troubling and raise serious questions about the fairness and impartiality of criminal trials in Brooklyn during Hynes's tenure. If witnesses were indeed coerced or mistreated in such a way, it would be a clear violation of their rights and could have unjustly influenced the outcome of trials. The former district attorney has not yet responded to these specific allegations, but they add to a growing list of criticisms of his office's conduct. Hynes was recently accused of withholding evidence that could have proven the innocence of individuals accused of various crimes, including murder. These allegations of misconduct and unethical behavior in the district attorney's office demonstrate the need for accountability and oversight in the criminal justice system. All individuals, whether they are accused of a crime or witnesses in a trial, deserve to be treated fairly and with respect. Failure to uphold these values undermines the integrity of the system and could result in wrongful convictions, leaving real criminals to go free."},{"instruction":"ere is a goal: piece of fruit How would you accomplish this goal?

Since everything happens for a reason in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did. I'm guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador.

However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a wellknown political family, as a new patricianlike plebeian aristocracy emerged.

Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the stateregulated sphere (as in patronclient relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on Negara, the Balinese state is an early, famous example.

Smith criticized mercantilism, advocating a system of free trade with division of labour. He postulated an invisible hand that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by selfinterest. Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit.

Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it's source material to become something bolder and more original (interestingly Camus also credits Cain's novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel The Stranger). The film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender. Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness (the lead character Cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a Mexican and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti is working in.

In recent months, various cases have brought to the spotlight the different ways in which companies and individuals try to circumvent export laws to sell sensitive technology to restricted countries. One example of this was the citation of a Pittsburgh-based company for exporting products with nuclear applications. The company in question had been selling these items to a variety of foreign countries, explicitly including Iran. This case is particularly concerning since Iran is under significant economic sanctions to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons. This Pittsburgh company's illegal sales could be used against America's national security interests. In another case, three Utah men were charged with attempting to illegally export jet fighter parts to Iran. These parts are listed under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), meaning that their export is prohibited without a license from the United States government. This case is currently under investigation, and the three men face severe legal consequences if found guilty. The reality that illegal exports are still occurring is alarming, with considerable consequences for the individuals and companies involved. These kinds of transactions can lead to countries with hostile relations with the United States developing more advanced weapons and capabilities, directly threatening America's national security.

Now exceeding expectations is a wildly different beast. That is, if you make no such promise about when something will get done but surpass the other person's hopes, they'll be absolutely thrilled.

No NFL player has ever come out while playing, though several have after their retirement. Ex49ers player Kwame Harris was charged last year with assaulting a former boyfriend. Until then, he was secretive about his sexuality.","output":"In a recent interview with radio host and comedian Artie Lange, 24-year-old San Francisco 49ers player Chris Culliver made offensive remarks about the potential presence of gay players on his team. When asked about the possibility, Culliver stated, \\"They gotta get up out of here if they do...Can’t be with that sweet stuff.\\" Following widespread backlash and criticism from both fans and his own team, Culliver has since backtracked on his comments, offering a nonsensical statement that does little to alleviate the damage caused by his initial remarks. The fact that no NFL player has ever come out while playing only further highlights the hostile environment that can be present within football culture, particularly when it comes to issues of sexuality. However, there have been several players who have come out after retiring from the sport, including former 49ers player Kwame Harris. Last year, Harris made headlines when he was charged with assaulting a former boyfriend, revealing his sexuality to the public for the first time. His story serves as a reminder that the pressures and prejudices of football can often force players to keep their true selves hidden from their peers and fans. Culliver's comments are especially troubling considering the ongoing struggles for LGBTQ+ rights across the country. Discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, both on and off the field, cannot be tolerated, and it is crucial for players and organizations within the NFL to acknowledge and actively fight against such prejudice. By perpetuating harmful attitudes and stereotypes, Culliver and others like him are only working to further alienate and oppress marginalized communities within the sport. Moving forward, it is vital that players, coaches, and fans alike work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting environment within football culture. Only then can we ensure that all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or identity, feel safe and welcome within this beloved sport."},{"instruction":"saw this film for the very first time several years ago and was hooked up in an instant.

This traditional calendar system was used by various Mesoamerican cultures, including the Maya and Aztec. The significance of the number 260 remains a mystery, but it played a crucial role in their agricultural and religious practices. One theory suggests that the 260-day count represents the approximate length of human pregnancy. This theory is supported by the fact that the number 260 is divisible by both 13 and 20, which were significant numbers in Mesoamerican numerology. Another theory proposes that the 260-day count corresponds to the length of a solar cycle, which is the time it takes for the sun to return to a fixed position in the sky. This theory is supported by the fact that the Maya had an advanced understanding of astronomy and used intricate calendrical systems to track celestial movements. Some researchers believe that the 260-day count may have originated from an earlier, simpler calendrical system used by the Olmec civilization. This theory suggests that the Olmec may have used a 13-day cycle in conjunction with a 20-day cycle, which would result in a 260-day count. Despite these theories, the exact origin of the 260-day count remains unclear. It is possible that a combination of these theories influenced the development of this calendrical system.

These talented players have the ability to accurately pass the ball to their teammates and score touchdowns. Touchdown passes longer than 5 yards are particularly impressive as they require the quarterback to have excellent arm strength, accuracy, and awareness of the game. In the 2020 NFL season, several quarterbacks stood out with their ability to make touchdown passes longer than 5 yards. Topping this list is Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers completed an astonishing 26 touchdown passes from distances of longer than 5 yards. Rodgers demonstrated his ability to throw long passes with accuracy and confidence throughout the season. Another quarterback who had an impressive season was Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes is known for his ability to throw the ball with speed and accuracy. Last season, he completed 24 touchdown passes from distances of longer than 5 yards. His arm strength and ability to make accurate passes under pressure make him one of the league's most exciting players to watch. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson also had a great season, completing 23 touchdown passes from distances of longer than 5 yards. Wilson has long been considered one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and his performance last season only cemented this reputation. Other notable players who completed touchdown passes longer than 5 yards include Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons, Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills, and Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Each of these players contributed significantly to their teams' success last season, and their ability to throw touchdown passes from longer distances was a key factor in their success.

It had a history of African slavery, although Britain abolished it decades before the US.

From the 1950s onwards, Bermuda relaxed its immigration laws, allowing increased immigration from Britain and Canada.

During that excursion, Bell took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a working holiday.

Although the telephone appeared to be an instant success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897.

The centre has been transformed into a pedestrian priority zone that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of filtered permeability to the existing irregular network of streets. It means that the network adaptations favour active transportation and, selectively, filter out the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre.

All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. They retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari. State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on.

Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[›] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered nullhomotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.

As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert.

The first and perhaps easiest tactic is to park in the shade whenever possible. Not only will this keep your vehicle cooler, but it will also protect your car's interior from the harmful effects of UV rays. If you can't find a shaded spot to park, investing in a sun shade is the next best thing. These covers are specifically designed to shield your car from the sun's rays and can reduce interior temperatures by as much as 15 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, they're easy to install and take down, making them a convenient option for busy drivers. Another way to reduce the heat inside your vehicle is to crack your windows. This allows for better air flow and helps to circulate the hot air out of your car. Just be sure to only open the windows enough to allow air in, but not enough to compromise the security of your vehicle. Finally, using a seat cover is a smart way to help keep the interior of your car cool. Choose a cover made from breathable material, like mesh or linen, that won't trap heat under your body. This can make a big difference on a hot day, especially if you have leather seats that can get uncomfortably hot. By following these simple tips, you can help keep your car cool and comfortable during even the hottest of summer days. And not only will you be more comfortable, but you'll also be protecting your vehicle's interior from the damaging effects of the sun."},{"instruction":"The Hunter Mountain Fire Tower is located on the summit of the eponymous mountain, second highest of the Catskill Mountains in the U.S. state of New York.

Also, he hoped to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain. The conflict mostly consisted of military action aimed at League members, such as the Battle of FontaineFrançaise, though the Spanish launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking Doullens, Cambrai and Le Catelet and in the spring of 1596 capturing Calais by April. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597 the French crown laid siege until its surrender in September.

Then he turned against the Ottomans, the Safavids their archrivals, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq and the Caucasus provinces and beyond Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–1618).

Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups. Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains poorly understood. However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should throw it out? ...

It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films).

Those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins and cephalosporins) or the cell membrane (polymyxins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities. Those that target protein synthesis (macrolides, lincosamides and tetracyclines) are usually bacteriostatic (with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides). Further categorization is based on their target specificity. Narrowspectrum antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as Gramnegative or Grampositive bacteria, whereas broadspectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria.

The gruesome incident left many in shock as Parker's actions were deemed unconscionable. After the police managed to apprehend him, Parker turned to the authorities and shockingly attributed his actions to the BBC. The motive behind this claim is unclear since he did not elaborate on why he held the media organization responsible for his actions. During his trial, Parker pleaded guilty to the crime and was given a hospital order after claiming that his responsibility was diminished at the time of the act.

Meanwhile, the city of Baquba experienced the highest death toll, with at least 40 people dying following a bombing incident. Additionally, eight individuals lost their lives in al-Madaan. Such incidents have become all too common in Iraq, as various factions continue to engage in sectarian conflicts and terrorist activities. Even Baghdad's legislators are not safe, as a bomb recently exploded at the home of a lawmaker, injuring two of their bodyguards. The situation in Iraq is cause for grave concern, with a U.N. official warning that the country may be headed for a \\"slide backwards into a dangerous unknown.\\" The violence and instability in the region not only threaten the safety and wellbeing of Iraqi citizens, but also have significant implications for the international community. Efforts must be made to address the root causes of the ongoing violence in Iraq and bring a sense of stability to the region. Political leaders and international organizations must work together to find a way to quell the sectarian unrest and put an end to the terrorism that plagues the country. The tragic loss of life in Iraq highlights just how dire the situation has become. It is imperative that we do everything in our power to prevent further violence and bring peace and stability to the region once and for all."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"negative"},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Thesandisfine,butthespaceforplayingisoftenlimited.","output":"The sand is fine, but the space for playing is often limited."},{"instruction":"ere are some keywords about a restaurant: name = The Punter, food = Japanese, priceRange = moderate.

All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms, and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host. An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species, which colonizes the mammalian colon, and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin. Neither of these colonizations are considered infections. The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance. Nonpathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions, and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection.

A deal breaker is a certain behavior or attitude that is not acceptable in a potential partner. These deal breakers can vary from person to person, depending on their values, beliefs, and upbringing. Before entering into any relationship, it's essential to take some time and figure out what your deal breakers are. This can include anything from lying, cheating, substance abuse, or a lack of ambition. Once you've identified your deal breakers, it's important to communicate these boundaries with your partner. Being comfortable with yourself is also crucial when it comes to relationships. Confidence and self-assurance can radiate positive energy and attract the right kinds of people. If you're uncomfortable in your own skin, it can be challenging to form deep connections with others. Keeping an open mind is also vital in establishing healthy relationships. Everyone has their own quirks and imperfections, but that's what makes us unique. It's essential to approach relationships with empathy and understanding, always keeping an open mind.
