Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

One important adjustment that you can make is to ensure that the pickups are at the optimal distance from the strings. Fortunately, this process is relatively easy to do yourself. To start, you’ll want to hold down the fret closest to the pickups on the top string. With the string held down, measure the distance between the pickup and the string. This will give you an idea of how much adjustment is needed. Next, you’ll want to locate the screws on the pickup. There will typically be one on either side of the pickup, near the top and bottom. Use a small screwdriver to turn the top screw in the pickup so that there’s a 1⁄16 in (1.6 mm) gap between the pickup and the string. This gap ensures that the pickup is picking up the optimal amount of sound from the string without distorting the sound. Once you’ve adjusted the pickup on the top string, you’ll want to repeat the process on the bottom string. Simply hold down the fret closest to the pickups on the bottom string, measure the distance between the pickup and the string, and adjust the screw accordingly. It’s important to note that the optimal distance between the pickups and the strings may vary depending on your particular guitar and playing style. Some guitarists prefer to have their pickups closer to the strings for a more pronounced sound, while others prefer a bit more distance for a more subtle sound. You can experiment with the distance to find what works best for you. In conclusion, adjusting the pickups on your guitar is a relatively simple process that can make a big difference in your sound quality. By holding down the fret closest to the pickups, measuring the distance between the pickup and the string, and adjusting the screws accordingly, you can ensure that your pickups are optimized for your playing style."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Boris is going for a smoke in 5 min.

Politician in her native country has now branded her 'morally damaging' Marco Fidel Ramirez claims video promotes 'lesbianism and stealing'","output":"Colombian popstar, Shakira, recently appeared in a racy music video alongside singer Rihanna that has sparked controversy in her native country. Politician Marco Fidel Ramirez has publicly criticized the video, claiming that it promotes \\"lesbianism and stealing.\\" Ramirez has accused the singers of setting a bad example, particularly for young girls who may look up to them as role models. The politician has even gone so far as to call the video \\"morally damaging\\" and urged the Colombian government to take action. Despite the backlash, both Shakira and Rihanna have defended the video as a work of art and a form of self-expression. They maintain that it is not meant to promote any particular lifestyle or behavior, but rather to express their artistic vision. Critics argue that Shakira's influence in Colombia makes her particularly responsible for the messages she puts out into the world. They fear that young fans may look up to her and emulate her behavior, leading to an increase in homosexuality and crime. The debate raises larger questions about the responsibility of celebrities to act as positive role models, particularly in countries where they are admired and respected. While some argue that artists like Shakira and Rihanna have the right to express themselves however they choose, others worry that their influence may have negative consequences. In the end, the debate over the \\"Can't Remember to Forget You\\" video is likely to continue.

This means that the tax rate for corporations was lowered from 35 percent to 33.5 percent. The reduction in the corporate income tax was a part of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. The goal of the tax reduction was to stimulate corporate investment and to encourage economic growth. The corporate income tax is a tax on the profits earned by corporations. The tax is calculated based on the net income of the corporation. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate meant that corporations could keep more of their profits, which could be reinvested in their business. This led to an increase in corporate investment, which helped to stimulate economic growth. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate was met with mixed reactions. Some people argued that the tax reduction would benefit large corporations at the expense of small businesses. Others argued that the tax reduction would help to create jobs and would ultimately benefit the economy.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface.

As 2.574 43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430 °C or 5700 K (the modern value is 5778 K). This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun. Before this, values ranging from as low as 1800 °C to as high as 13,000,000 °C were claimed.

While the country has become synonymous with the name \\"Ireland\\" in modern times, it has not always been called that. The Irish name for their country is \\"Éire,\\" which translates to \\"land of abundance\\" or \\"land of plenty.\\" The name has its roots in Gaelic, the traditional language of Ireland. We know that the name \\"Éire\\" was in use at least as far back as the 5th century AD, when the Roman writer Ammianus Marcellinus referred to the island as \\"Hibernia, which is also called Scotia.\\" The name \\"Ireland\\" actually comes from the Irish word \\"Éireann,\\" which means \\"belonging to Éire.\\" The earliest recorded use of the name \\"Ireland\\" comes from the Annals of Tigernach, a medieval Irish chronicle, which dates back to the 11th century AD. So, to answer the question, Ireland was known as Éire first. The name Ireland, while ultimately derived from the Irish language, was not used until much later in history.

The first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s. Rational drug discovery from plants started particularly with the isolation of morphine, analgesic and sleepinducing agent from opium, by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner, who named the compound after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. Multinational corporations including Merck, HoffmanLa Roche, BurroughsWellcome (now part of Glaxo Smith Kline), Abbott Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) began as local apothecary shops in the mid1800s. By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes.

Hearn is confident that Brook would knock out Khan if they ever step into the ring together. Although Khan has yet to accept the offer, Hearn remains optimistic that the fight will eventually happen. When it comes to fighters who can bounce back from defeat, Ricky Burns is a name that comes to mind. Burns, a Scottish boxer, lost his WBO lightweight title to Terence Crawford in March 2014. However, Burns has a history of bouncing back from defeat and his fans are confident that he will do it again this time around. Lastly, there's Anthony Joshua, a rising British heavyweight boxer who has a case of mistaken identity. Apparently, some people believe that the 24-year-old Joshua is actually a bouncer named \\"AJ\\" who works at a club in Brixton. While this is an amusing case of mistaken identity, Joshua's fans are more focused on his impressive record inside the ring. In just six professional fights, Joshua has managed to win all of them by knockout. In conclusion, the world of boxing is filled with exciting matches, intriguing storylines, and personalities that captivate their fans. From the highly anticipated rematch between Froch and Groves to the potential showdown between Brook and Khan, there's always something to look forward to in boxing."},{"instruction":"Question: During which activity will light most likely be refracted?

One important thing to keep in mind is that not all silver is the same, and different types of silver may require different cleaning methods. For example, if you're cleaning silver that has an intricate design or delicate details, using a cleaning method that involves rubbing or scrubbing may not be the best idea. In this case, a gentler method, such as soaking the silver in a solution, may work better. Another important consideration is handling hot silver. When cleaning silver using hot water, it's important to use tongs or another tool to touch the silver, rather than your bare hands. This not only helps prevent burns but also reduces the risk of damaging the silver by accidentally dropping it. Finally, if you're dealing with very tarnished silver, it may require a longer soak in the cleaning solution to achieve the desired results. In this case, it's important to be patient and allow the silver to soak for the recommended amount of time, rather than rushing the process. Overall, when it comes to cleaning silver, it's important to be mindful of the type of silver you're dealing with and to use the appropriate cleaning method. By doing so, you can help ensure that your silver remains in top condition for years to come."},{"instruction":"With this prayer does not the suppliant make himself one with his surroundings or his neighbour Who else is he thinking of when he says our and us Yes true enough the Christians have an ingenious model for the perfect prayer but even so it does not cover everything they privately want or feel compelled to pray for Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","output":"\\"Yes, true enough, the Christians have an ingenious model for the perfect prayer, but even so it does not cover everything they privately want or feel compelled to pray for.

Thousands of young men joined its ranks—reliable estimates range from 15,000 to 23,000. The great majority of the recruits were Burman, with little ethnic minority representation.

Return the wellsealed bags to the freezer and use as needed.","output":"Herbs have become an essential ingredient in many different types of cuisine, bringing a variety of flavors and aromas to dishes. However, sometimes finding the right combination of fresh herbs can be challenging, especially if you don't have a garden or easy access to a grocery store. Fortunately, freezing herbs with olive oil is a quick and easy way to preserve herbs’ flavors and extend their shelf life. To begin, simply fill each compartment of an ice cube tray with fresh chopped herbs of your choice. You can use any type of herb you like, including parsley, basil, rosemary, thyme, cilantro, or dill. Be sure to remove any stems or hard pieces, as these won't freeze well. Next, add enough olive oil to cover the herbs in each compartment of the tray. Olive oil is a great choice because it’s healthy and it will provide you with the necessary liquid to freeze the herbs. Once you've filled the compartments with herbs and oil, cover the tray with plastic wrap, tape the edges down, and place the tray in the freezer. Allow the herbs to freeze overnight or for several days. When the herbs are frozen, remove the tray from the freezer and pop the herb cubes out, one compartment at a time. Place the herb cubes or frozen herb cubes in a plastic freezer bag, and be sure to label the bag with the type of herbs contained in it. Return the well-sealed bags to the freezer and use the cubes as needed. There are so many uses for frozen herbs with olive oil. For instance, you can use them as a base for soups and stews, or sauté them with other vegetables. You can also throw them in as an instant seasoning whenever you want. By preparing your herbs with olive oil and freezing them in ice cube trays, you'll always have fresh herbs on hand whenever you need them, and that will elevate the taste of your dishes without the hassle of running back to the grocery store."},{"instruction":"ere are some concepts: building, clock, point What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"The clock on the building showed the exact point in time."},{"instruction":"Read this: Genetic studies on Jews show that most Jews worldwide bear a common genetic heritage which originates in the Middle East, and that they bear their strongest resemblance to the peoples of the Fertile Crescent.

Cempoala, located in present-day Mexico, was a significant trading center and a rival to the powerful city-state of Tenochtitlan. When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico in 1519, he knew that winning the support of Cempoala would be crucial in his mission to conquer the Aztec empire. Cortés and his men were initially welcomed by the people of Cempoala, who were also enemies of the Aztecs. The Totonac people, who inhabited Cempoala, were impressed by the advanced weaponry and the exotic animals brought by the Spaniards. Cortés used this opportunity to establish an alliance with the Totonac people and gain their trust. With the help of his Totonac allies, Cortés was able to defeat the Aztecs in several battles. He then proceeded to Tenochtitlan, where he met the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II. However, the initial friendship between Cortés and Moctezuma quickly turned into animosity, and the Spanish conquistador eventually managed to capture and execute the Aztec ruler. Cempoala remained a crucial ally to the Spanish throughout their conquest of Mexico. However, the Totonac people eventually grew disillusioned with the conquistadors and rebelled against Spanish rule. Despite this, the influence of the Spanish conquistadors changed the course of history in Mexico forever. In conclusion, Cortés first visited the city of Cempoala before heading to Tenochtitlan.

The groundhog is also referred to as a chuck, woodshock, groundpig, whistlepig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk and, among French Canadians in eastern Canada, siffleux. The name \`\`thickwood badger'' was given in the Northwest to distinguish the animal from the prairie badger. Monax was a Native American name of the woodchuck, which meant \`\`the digger''. Young groundhogs may be called chucklings. Other marmots, such as the yellowbellied and hoary marmots, live in rocky and mountainous areas, but the groundhog is a lowland creature.

She cites changed gender roles, raised expectations for financial stability in marriage. Coontz: Widening economic gap in U.S. is reflected in marriage gap. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In a recent study, 40 percent of adults surveyed stated that they believe marriage is becoming obsolete. This statistic seems to contradict the fact that a majority of those surveyed still express a desire to get married. Sociologist Stephanie Coontz has asked, why the disconnect? Coontz suggests that changing gender roles and increased expectations for financial stability in marriage may be contributing to this phenomenon. Traditionally, men were expected to be the primary breadwinners in a marriage. However, as more women enter the workforce and become financially independent, the dynamics of marriage have changed. Today, both partners are often expected to contribute financially, which can create tension and unequal distribution of responsibilities. Furthermore, with the rising cost of living, many people may feel that they cannot afford to get married. The expectation of owning a home and having financial stability before tying the knot may deter many from pursuing marriage. The widening economic gap in the United States is also reflected in the marriage gap. According to Coontz, those with higher incomes and higher education levels are more likely to get and stay married. Meanwhile, those with lower incomes and education levels are less likely to enter into marriage or experience divorce. It is essential to recognize the evolving nature of marriage and the changing expectations that come with it. While the desire to get married may still be prevalent, the barriers to doing so are becoming increasingly complex. As society continues to evolve and adapt, it is crucial to address these challenges and create a future where everyone has access to stable, fulfilling relationships regardless of financial circumstances."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: Daughter of Niels Andersen and Frederikke Rhr","output":"Daughter of Niels Andersen and Frederikke Rhr."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to persuade your parents to let you go out on your own Talk to your parents more often.

Copper compounds have been used to treat common plant and livestock ailments, while sulfur has been effective against serious bacterial and fungal infections. One popular way to use copper for plant disease prevention is by creating a Bordeaux mixture. This mixture, typically made from copper sulfate, lime, and water, can be sprayed on plants to prevent fungal diseases such as black spot, downy mildew, and leaf blights. The mixture is especially effective on grapes, tomatoes, and potatoes. Copper compounds can also be used to treat common livestock diseases such as foot rot and mastitis. Copper sulfate can be added to feed or water sources to help prevent and treat these ailments. For serious infections in humans, sulfur can be a helpful remedy. Sulfur has antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties that make it an effective treatment for conditions such as acne, ringworm, and toenail fungus. Sulfur can be applied topically in the form of creams or gels, or taken orally as a supplement. While copper and sulfur can be effective treatments, it’s important to note that they should be used wisely and in appropriate doses. Overuse of copper can lead to toxic buildup in the soil, and excessive use of sulfur can cause skin irritation and other adverse effects. For those interested in natural remedies, there are a variety of homemade preparations that can be tried. For example, a tea made from eucalyptus leaves can help relieve cold and flu symptoms, while ginger tea can be effective for upset stomachs. It’s important to do thorough research and consult with a healthcare provider before trying any homemade remedies. In conclusion, copper and sulfur can be powerful tools for treating a variety of common diseases. By using them responsibly and in appropriate doses, we can harness the power of these natural substances to promote health and wellness.

However, many people often overlook the expiration date or shelf life of cheese, putting themselves at risk of foodborne illness. Here are some general guidelines on how long you should keep different types of cheese. For unrefrigerated cheese, it is recommended to toss it after two days. This is because unrefrigerated cheese is not only susceptible to bacteria but also to mold. Leaving it out for too long may cause it to spoil or become contaminated, which can lead to food poisoning. On the other hand, refrigerated cheese can last for up to three to four weeks, depending on the type of cheese. However, it is always best to check the expiration date printed on the packaging to ensure that it is safe to eat. Certain kinds of cheese, such as soft cheeses like Brie or Camembert, have a shorter shelf life and should be eaten within one to two weeks of opening. Frozen cheese is also an option to extend its shelf life. However, it is important to note that the texture and flavor may be altered once thawed. Frozen cheese should be used within six months to ensure its quality. In conclusion, knowing when to throw out cheese is crucial in maintaining food safety and preventing foodborne illness.

Here are some tips for taking care of your parakeet and building trust with him. First and foremost, make sure your bird's physical needs are met. This includes providing him with a spacious cage with adequate room for flying and exercising. The cage should also have perches of varied sizes and textures to promote foot health and prevent boredom. Fresh water and food should be readily available at all times, and the cage should be cleaned regularly to maintain hygiene. Moreover, making your parakeet feel safe in his environment is crucial to his well-being. Place the cage in a quiet and secure area of the house, away from extreme temperatures, drafts, and direct sunlight. Covering the cage at night can also give your bird a sense of security and help regulate his sleeping habits. Aside from these basic needs, parakeets also love to play and interact with their human companions. Provide your bird with a variety of toys that cater to his chewing, shredding, and perching instincts. These can include wooden blocks, bells, ladders, swings, and mirrors. Rotation and replacement of toys every few weeks can keep the bird engaged and prevent boredom. Encouraging your parakeet to trust you is another essential aspect of pet ownership. Start by sitting calmly and quietly near the cage, talking softly to your bird and offering him treats. Gradually increase your proximity to the cage and eventually open the door to allow the bird to come out on his own terms. Avoid making sudden movements or loud noises that can startle the bird, and be patient as building trust takes time and consistency. In summary, taking care of your parakeet involves meeting his physical needs, providing him a sense of safety, offering him stimulating toys, and building trust through gradual interactions. By attending to these aspects of pet care, you can enjoy a fulfilling and healthy relationship with your feathered companion."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question.

The Cuban government says it owns the military equipment found on a North Korean ship seized by Panamanian authorities, and the obsolete defensive weapons found hidden in a cargo of sugar were to be repaired in the country before being returned to Cuba, the BBC reports. Cuba says the cargo included two antiaircraft missile complexes, nine missiles in parts and spares, two MiG 21Bis fighter planes, and 15 MiG engines, all made in the mid20th century.

The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a generalpurpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turingcomplete.

One of the best ways to do this is to take the initiative and offer to help with various tasks. Firstly, familiarize yourself with the curriculum. It's important to have a basic understanding of what the students are learning so you can better assist them and the teacher. You can also offer to check homework and grade papers, which lightens the workload for the teacher and helps ensure that students are receiving timely feedback. Communication with parents is also crucial in establishing a supportive and collaborative classroom environment. Offer to communicate with parents on the teacher's behalf, whether it's through phone calls, emails, or parent-teacher conferences. This can assist both the teacher and the parents in addressing the student's needs. Running errands for the teacher is another task that can be very helpful. This can include picking up copies, materials, or even running to the office to deliver important documents or messages. Assisting with the schedule and calendar can also be beneficial. Offer to input important dates or events into the calendar or help create a schedule for the students with the teacher’s guidance. Even watching students for a brief period of time while the teacher steps out can be a big help. This can provide the teacher with some extra time to prepare for the next lesson or tend to other tasks. Lastly, it's important to offer to help with special discipline cases, whenever possible. This can take on many forms, depending on the severity of the situation, but ultimately it's about supporting the teacher and creating a safe and respectful learning environment for all students. Overall, listening to the teacher's needs and taking the initiative to offer help where you can will make you a valuable asset to the classroom.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called aether. Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected.

The abandoned planes have become a haven for these children who use them to play and sell plane parts. Brown's visit to the airport was accompanied by a security lapse that allowed the children to guide him around the planes. The Goma Airport was abandoned in 2002 due to the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo that covered the runway with lava. Since then, the planes have remained untouched, gradually rusting away in the African sun. The presence of the planes has provided an unusual source of amusement for local street children, who are often forced to grow up too quickly. The children's knowledge of the plane parts has allowed them to sell them effectively to interested buyers. Brown's photographs offer a glimpse into the lives of these children, who have to fend for themselves in a city that has been marred by war and genocide. Goma's recent history has indeed been dominated by the horrors of war and genocide. The Rwandan Genocide of 1994 and the First and Second Congo Wars have both had a lasting impact on the city. The struggles of the Congolese people have been captured through Brown's lens, who has managed to convey their resilience and spirit even in the face of adversity. In conclusion, Michael Christopher Brown's photographs of Goma Airport and the Congolese street children have proven to be breathtaking and thought-provoking. The images provide a glimpse into the day-to-day struggles of people living in a city marked by war and displacement.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Peter Reynolds Accuses JP Yvonne Davies of Scaremongering Peter Reynolds is one of four individuals who have filed complaints against JP Yvonne Davies. According to Reynolds, a cannabis activist and politician, Davies is guilty of scaremongering. Reynolds' complaint targets the 65-year-old's statements regarding cannabis use and its effects on mental health. The complaint comes after Davies' public statements on the dangers of cannabis. Davies lost her brother to cannabis use, and has been vocal about the need to regulate the drug in order to prevent similar tragedies. However, Reynolds argues that these statements are misleading and fear-inducing. He has accused Davies of exaggerating the risks of cannabis use, and of ignoring the benefits that the drug can provide to patients suffering from certain conditions. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate surrounding cannabis use and regulation. While some argue that the drug poses significant health risks, others point to its potential medical benefits and argue for legalisation. As the debate continues, it is clear that opinions on the issue are deeply divided. However, it is important for all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue, and to base their arguments on evidence-based research rather than fear and emotion."},{"instruction":"Question: What are space suits an example of a solution to?

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

However, it took some time before the team reached the pinnacle of the sport. After being hired in 2000, Belichick didn't lead the Patriots to a Super Bowl victory until the 2001 season. This was the team's first Super Bowl win in franchise history. Belichick and the Patriots would go to win two more Super Bowls in the next three years, cementing their status as one of the greatest dynasties in NFL history. Belichick inherited a talented team when he took over as head coach, but it was far from a championship-caliber squad. The Patriots had made the playoffs just once in the previous six years, and there were questions about the team's quarterback situation after franchise icon Drew Bledsoe suffered a season-ending injury early in the 2001 season. Despite these challenges, Belichick quickly established himself as a master strategist and motivator, leading the Patriots to a surprising 11-5 record and a berth in the playoffs. In the postseason, the team upset the heavily-favored Oakland Raiders in a controversial game that featured the famous \\"Tuck Rule\\" play. The Patriots then went on to stun the heavily-favored St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, with a game-winning drive orchestrated by young quarterback Tom Brady. The Patriots' victory in Super Bowl XXXVI was a validation of Belichick's coaching acumen and set the stage for a run of dominance that would last for years. With Belichick at the helm, the Patriots would win two more Super Bowls in the next three seasons, finishing the 2003 and 2004 campaigns as champions. In total, Belichick would lead the Patriots to six Super Bowl victories during his time as head coach, making him one of the most successful coaches in NFL history. While it took some time for Belichick and the Patriots to reach championship glory, their sustained run of success under his leadership will remain one of the greatest achievements in the sport's history."},{"instruction":"The name Edith has four name days : 14 May in Estonia , 31 October in Latvia , 5 July in Sweden and September 16 in France .

In essence, a reducción was a colonial town that facilitated the Catholic Church's missionary work and the Spanish Empire's efforts to consolidate its control over indigenous populations. The concept of reducciones was initially proposed by Jesuit missionaries who wanted to create Christian communities that were separate from indigenous settlements. The Spanish authorities eventually adopted the policy, and it became an integral part of colonial governance in the Americas. Some of the earliest reducciones were established in what is now Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay. For example, San Ignacio de Loyola was founded in 1576 in what is now eastern Paraguay. The town was home to the Guarani people, and it quickly became an important center of missionary activity. Another early reducción was established in Juli, Peru, in 1565. The town was originally known as San Juan de Letrán, but it was renamed after the Jesuit patron saint. Juli became an important center for art and architecture, and it is still known for its colonial-era buildings and artwork. Other notable reducciones from this period include Cuzco, Peru, and Asunción, Paraguay. In each case, the establishment of a reducción represented a significant transformation for the indigenous communities involved. They were forced to adapt to a new way of life that was dictated by the Spanish Empire and the Catholic Church. Despite the challenges and controversies associated with the policy of reducciones, these early colonial towns played a pivotal role in shaping the history of Latin America. They represent a fascinating intersection of colonial power, religion, and cultural exchange."},{"instruction":"Please add spaces between words: Japanesemassage,bathroom,massage,bath,asslicking,Japanese,teen(18+)","output":"Japanese massage, bathroom, massage, bath, ass licking, Japanese, teen (18+)"},{"instruction":"Add spaces: Description:ChibaWorkoutWristguardIItrainingglove","output":"Description: Chiba Workout Wristguard II training gloves."},{"instruction":"Question: What would happen if a lower court refused to uphold a constitutional law?

Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was delighted to finally see this movie. Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville humour, the slapstick not the witty banter, clash with Wodehouse's British sense of humour. But on the whole, the American style banter makes the American characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures. Some inventive staging for the dance numbers, including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the top dance number. They seem a lot more realistic, if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic. The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore don't hurt the movie, instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge. It's also nice not to have a wise cracking, headstrong love interest.

Its metaphysics includes the concept of māyā and ātman. Māyā connotes that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal. The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be. The concept of ātman is of soul, self within each person, each living being. Advaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence. They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Selfknowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.

VanConett had a license to carry a concealed weapon, but unfortunately for him, his employer prohibits employees from bringing weapons into the store. As a result of VanConett's actions, he was fired from his job, even though he had only intended to protect himself and his co-workers from harm. While it is understandable that 7-Eleven has policies in place to ensure the safety of customers and employees, it is unfortunate that VanConett's attempt to act heroically resulted in the loss of his job. Many people are divided on the issue of whether or not employers have the right to prohibit their employees from carrying weapons. On the one hand, companies have the duty to protect their workers and customers, and they may feel that allowing weapons onto the premises could lead to dangerous situations. On the other hand, individuals who hold licenses to carry concealed weapons may feel that it is their right to carry them at all times, in order to protect themselves and others. In this particular case, it seems that VanConett had good intentions, but unfortunately, his actions led to his dismissal. It is important for employees to be aware of their company's policies regarding weapons, and to follow them accordingly, even if they are licensed to carry. Ultimately, the question of whether or not employers have the right to prohibit weapons on their premises is a controversial one, and it will likely continue to be debated in the years to come. What is clear, however, is that violating such policies can have serious consequences, as Robert VanConett unfortunately learned the hard way."},{"instruction":"Chinese shares close lower Wednesday Generate a new sentence that is, on a scale from 0 to 5, a 2 in textual similarity to the above sentence.","output":"China's stock market finishes down for the day on Wednesday."},{"instruction":"@Support@ 1877#778#89.69 Dell Technical support Phone Number?

Soak for several hours.","output":"Dyeing Curtains at Home: A Step-by-Step Guide If you're looking to add a pop of color to your home décor, dyeing your curtains is a great way to do it. With just a few simple steps, you can transform your curtains from drab to fab. Here's how to dye your curtains at home: Step 1: Fill a large tub with hot water Start by filling a large tub with hot water. Make sure the tub is big enough to comfortably fit your curtains. Step 2: Prepare the dye Choose a dye that's designed specifically for the type of fabric your curtains are made of. Follow the instructions on the dye package to prepare the dye. This typically involves mixing the dye with hot water and stirring until dissolved. Step 3: Mix in the dye Once you've prepared the dye, pour it into the tub of hot water. Use a wooden spoon or stick to stir the dye into the water. Step 4: Soak the curtains Carefully place your curtains in the dye bath. Use your hands to swirl the curtains around in the water, making sure they're fully submerged. Step 5: Add salt or vinegar Depending on the type of dye you're using, you may need to add salt or vinegar to the water. Check the dye package instructions to see if this is necessary. Salt is often used for natural fibers like cotton, while vinegar is used for synthetic fabrics like polyester. Step 6: Soak for several hours Let your curtains soak in the dye bath for several hours. Check on them periodically to ensure they're getting even coverage. The longer you let them soak, the darker the color will be. Step 7: Rinse and dry Once your curtains have soaked for the desired amount of time, remove them from the dye bath and rinse them thoroughly with cool water. Hang them up to dry, making sure they're fully dry before re-hanging them in your home. In just a few hours, you can transform your curtains from boring to beautiful with this easy DIY dyeing method."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence Today, nearly all commonly used video compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the ITUT or ISO) apply a discrete cosine transform (DCT) for spatial redundancy reduction. provide a valid answer to the question What do all commonly used video compression methods use?

However, based on historical accounts and estimations, it is believed that approximately 120 years have elapsed between these two events. Cao Qin's coup took place during the late Han Dynasty in the year 196 CE, when he successfully overthrew the reigning emperor in a bid for power. Hong you lu, on the other hand, is a famous novel written during the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to 1644 CE. The novel is set in the early years of the Ming Dynasty, around the year 1573. Assuming that the events in Hong you lu are set in the year 1573, and that the Ming Dynasty began in 1368 CE, it can be estimated that approximately 205 years have elapsed since the start of the Ming Dynasty. Subtracting this from the year 1573, it can be estimated that approximately 1368 - 1573 - 205 years have elapsed between the start of the Ming Dynasty and the events in Hong you lu. However, determining the exact year of Cao Qin's coup is more challenging, as historical records are imprecise and there is some debate over the exact dating of events during this period. Some scholars believe that the coup may have taken place in the year 194 or 195 CE, while others suggest that it may have occurred as late as 200 CE.

Juan Mata, one of United's star players, has praised van Gaal's methods and believes that they will bring rewards in the future. The Spanish midfielder is known for his technical ability and creative play, and it is clear that he is adapting well to the Dutchman's approach. Of course, there is still work to be done at United, particularly in the transfer market. The club's fans will be hoping to see van Gaal make some shrewd signings that can take the team to the next level. Many names have been linked with the club, including Gareth Bale, Paulo Dybala and Thomas Müller. Regardless of who arrives at Old Trafford, it seems that van Gaal has a clear plan for his side. If he can continue to get his message across, and if Mata and the rest of the squad can execute his ideas on the pitch, then United fans can look forward to a bright future under the man from Amsterdam."},{"instruction":"who wrote stop look listen to your heart??","output":"Marvin Gaye wrote \\"Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)\\" along with Thom Bell and Linda Creed."},{"instruction":"who played mrs howell on gilligan's island??","output":"Natalie Schafer."},{"instruction":"Context: Hoping to break their current losing streak the Cowboys played on home ground for an Interconference duel with the Jaguars.

The FDA has declared that salmon engineered by AquaBounty Technologies is safe to eat and poses no threat to the environment, reports the AP. The ruling makes it all but certain that the agency will grant final approval for the creature that critics call Frankenfish, reports the New York Times. Those who partake will be eating an Atlantic salmon that has a growthhormone gene from Pacific Chinook salmon. Scientists also added a gene from a fish called the ocean pout that keeps the growthhormone gene on constantly. The upshot is that these salmon get big in a fraction of the usual time. They will be raised in farms and all will be bred to be sterile females, though the AP says a small percentage might be able to breed. That has critics worried about what might happen if they escape. The FDA review was actually completed months ago, and the White House has been accused of delaying its release for political gain. Slate has an investigative piece on that angle. Expand this summary.","output":"The FDA has approved the consumption of the first genetically modified animal, a salmon produced by AquaBounty Technologies.

His cousin is charged with failing to report production and possession.","output":"Roger Bergendorff, a 57-year-old man, has been charged with possession of a toxin and firearms in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bergendorff was hospitalized for ricin exposure after it was found in his hotel room. His cousin, Thomas Tholen, has also been charged with failing to report the production and possession of the toxin. The discovery of the toxin in Bergendorff's hotel room caused an evacuation of the hotel and a hazardous materials response. Ricin is a deadly poison that can be made from castor beans. It can cause respiratory and organ failure in victims, leading to death. The possession of ricin is illegal under federal law. Bergendorff had been living in the hotel room for several weeks before the discovery of the toxin. He was found unconscious and suffering from respiratory distress when authorities entered his room. He was taken to the hospital and placed in a medically-induced coma. The investigation into Bergendorff's possession of the toxin led authorities to his cousin, Tholen. Tholen admitted to helping Bergendorff produce the toxin in his home and his garage. Tholen also admitted to possessing a handgun, ammunition, and a stolen shotgun. Tholen's failure to report the production and possession of the toxin is a serious crime that can result in a prison sentence of up to five years. Bergendorff's possession of the toxin and firearms is also a serious crime that will be punished accordingly. The possession of illegal toxins and firearms is a dangerous and illegal activity that puts the public's safety at risk. The penalties for these crimes are severe and should serve as a warning to others who may consider engaging in similar activities. In conclusion, the charges against Bergendorff and Tholen serve as a reminder that the possession of toxins and firearms is illegal and potentially deadly. The public must remain vigilant, and law enforcement agencies must continue to investigate and prosecute those who engage in these dangerous activities."},{"instruction":"What would be an example of an positive review?","output":"An example of a positive review is: \\"I had an amazing experience at this restaurant!
