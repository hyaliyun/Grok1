The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be eclectic. In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources.

Letters written by his mother and sister describe his 'father's behaviour' Higgins jnr was 'exposed to alcohol and drugs from an early age' court told.","output":"Jordan Higgins, aged 31, and one accomplice were both sentenced to 18 months in jail after robbing a shop in Cheadle, Manchester. According to reports, they robbed the shop at dawn, pushing the owner over and filling a duvet with cigarettes before fleeing the scene. While this crime may appear to be a random act of robbery, it is interesting to note that Jordan Higgins’ father, Alex, is considered one of snooker’s greatest ever players. Alex Higgins passed away in 2010 after battling with years of alcoholism and gambling addiction. In court, it was revealed that Jordan Higgins had lived in the shadow of his father’s fame and, unfortunately, had been exposed to alcohol and drugs from an early age. The defence lawyer revealed that young Higgins had even attended the Priory for alcohol misuse at just 14 years of age. His mother and sister wrote letters to the court explaining their thoughts and feelings, describing his father’s behaviour and the toll it had taken on the family. It is a sad testimony that growing up in the shadow of a famous parent can lead to living a life of disappointment and poor decision making. Jordan Higgins’ struggles with addiction and inability to resist the temptation of a life of crime may be resonant of the difficulties that come with such a burden. Whilst the crime committed may be inexcusable, it is worth understanding the circumstances that led to this regrettable outcome. It is essential to appreciate that everyone has a story and that every action has a cause. It is this understanding that allows us to work together as a community to support those who may be struggling with addiction, mental illness, or any other challenge that they are faced with. We hope that Jordan Higgins will use this time to reflect on his mistakes and come out a better, stronger person."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"Feeling so grateful for all the amazing people in my life!

The G-BOMBS diet involves cutting out meat, eggs, and dairy, which are high in saturated fats and cholesterol. Plant-based sources of protein, such as beans and seeds, are used instead.

These foods are typically high in calories and low in nutrients, leading to weight gain and an increased risk of chronic disease.

Shortterm memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited: George A. Miller (1956), when working at Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing that the store of shortterm memory was 7±2 items (the title of his famous paper, The magical number 7±2). Modern estimates of the capacity of shortterm memory are lower, typically of the order of 4–5 items; however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking. For example, in recalling a tendigit telephone number, a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a threedigit chunk (456) and lastly a fourdigit chunk (7890). This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.

Fortunately, there are several strategic ways to overcome some of these challenges, such as forming an alliance with an existing business, bidding on a government contract, and getting business product(s) licensed. Forming an alliance with an existing business can offer a new entrepreneur the opportunity to use an established brand's reputation, customer base, and marketing channels. An alliance can also provide access to resources such as raw materials, manufacturing equipment, logistics, and distribution capabilities. Furthermore, an alliance can enable the new business to enter the market more quickly, as it leverages existing networks and reduces startup costs. Bidding on a government contract is another smart way to start a business. Government contracts can offer a stable source of revenue for a new venture, as many contracts are multi-year agreements. Moreover, government contracts provide a fantastic opportunity to develop expertise in a field and gain exposure to other private sector clients. Getting business product(s) licensed can be an effective way to expand a new venture's product range and generate additional revenue streams. Licensing enables a company to collaborate with other companies that are interested in producing a similar product. This allows entrepreneurs to focus on developing new products and other aspects of their business, while their licensed products generate income. In conclusion, there are many options available to entrepreneurs who want to start their own business.

There is some risk, UNICEF country director says.","output":"Since 1960, the Central African Republic has faced numerous challenges in governance, security, and stability. The country is known for having experienced five coup d'etats, which has contributed to the weak governance in the country. The lack of governance has resulted in pervasive corruption, human rights abuses, and insecurity. Many people think that the conflict in the Central African Republic is religiously motivated, but it's not. Despite it being a predominantly Christian country, Muslims have lived peacefully with Christians for decades. The conflict is about natural resources, which are the primary source of income for the country. According to one aid worker, the conflict in the Central African Republic has been fueled by the scramble for control of the country's natural resources, especially diamonds, gold, and timber. This scramble for resources has led to conflicts between different groups, resulting in violent clashes. A recent report by the Enough Project links Seleka, a rebel group in the Central African Republic, to Chadian and Sudanese groups, mercenaries, and diamond traders. These groups are said to be involved in the illegal trade of natural resources, contributing to the instability in the country. The UNICEF country director has acknowledged that there is a risk in the country, particularly for children. Schools have been closed, and children have been forced to flee their homes due to the ongoing conflict.

The process of obtaining a Japanese driver's license can be daunting, but with the right preparation, it can be completed with ease. The first step in obtaining a Japanese driver's license is to obtain an official translation of your driver's license from your home country. This translation must be done by a certified translator and can be done either in Japan or in your home country before arriving in Japan. Once you have the translated license, you will need to visit a Driver's License Center. At the center, you will need to submit the required documents, such as your passport, residence card, and translated driver's license. After submitting your documents, you will then need to take a vision and hearing test to ensure that you are fit to drive. If you wear glasses or contacts, make sure to bring them with you to the test. If you are required to take the written driving exam, you will need to study beforehand as the exam is only offered in Japanese. You can find study materials online or purchase them at the Driver's License Center. If you pass the written exam, you will need to schedule a practical road test. The road test is conducted in a car provided by the Driver's License Center, and you will need to demonstrate your driving skills in various situations, such as turning, merging, and stopping. Once you have passed the road test, you will be issued your Japanese driver's license. Note that the process of obtaining a Japanese driver's license can take several weeks, so plan accordingly.

Between 255246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of presentday Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the GrecoBactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III.

It's important to establish a regular cleaning routine to ensure that your home stays clean and fresh. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to keep your home tidy when you have pets. 1. Vacuum regularly Vacuuming is the key to keeping pet hair and dander at bay. Make sure to use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to capture tiny allergens. If you have carpets, use a vacuum with a beater bar to thoroughly clean them. Also, use an enzyme cleaner to treat old pet messes that may have left behind stains and odors. 2. Clean furniture Pets love to snuggle on furniture, so it's important to clean your couches and chairs regularly. Use a lint roller or fabric cleaner to remove pet hair and dander. If you have leather furniture, use a leather cleaner to keep it looking its best. 3. Give your pet a bath Regular baths are essential to keeping your pets smelling fresh and clean. Use a pet-friendly shampoo and conditioner to avoid irritating their skin. Make sure to dry them thoroughly to prevent them from getting cold. 4. Wash your pet's bed Your pet's bed can easily become a breeding ground for bacteria and allergens. Wash it regularly with a mild detergent and let it air dry. If your pet's bed is too big to fit in the washing machine, spot clean it with a damp cloth and vacuum it thoroughly. 5. Clean your pet's toys and accessories Your pet's toys and accessories can also become a source of odor and bacteria. Wash them regularly with a mild detergent and let them dry completely before giving them back to your pet. 6. Replace the litter If you have a cat, make sure to replace their litter regularly. Scoop out waste daily and change the litter completely every one to two weeks. Use a litter box with a lid to prevent litter from getting all over your floors. 7. Clean the cage If you have a small pet like a rabbit or guinea pig, make sure to clean their cage regularly. Change their bedding weekly and wipe down the cage with a pet-safe disinfectant. By following these tips, you can keep your home clean and fresh while still enjoying the companionship of your furry friend.

This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron, the PanSlavic and Orthodox Russian Empire. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the powder keg of Europe. In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece.

During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles.

The beauty of capturing a moment in time is that it allows us to revisit an experience or emotion long after it has passed. This is why it's important to photograph things that inspire us. Whether it's a stunning landscape, a unique building or a portrait of a loved one, there is something special about capturing those moments that stir our hearts. To truly capture the essence of your subject, it's important to work on composing your shots. Consider the rule of thirds, framing your subject within the frame, and creating depth by utilizing leading lines. These techniques can make your photographs more visually appealing and help to tell a story. Another aspect of composition is adjusting the distance between your subject and the camera. By zooming in or out, you can change the perspective and alter the focus of the image. Experimenting with distance can add dimension and interest to your photographs. The exposure triangle is another tool that can help you gain more control over your photographs. Consisting of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, adjusting these settings can alter the brightness and mood of your image. Playing around with the exposure triangle can help you achieve the desired effect for your photograph. Lastly, finding time to practice as much as possible is essential for honing your skills. Photography is a skill that can always be improved upon, and the more you practice, the more confident and competent you will become. Take your camera with you wherever you go, and seize every opportunity to snap a photograph. In conclusion, if you want to improve your photography skills, photograph things that inspire you, work on composing your shots, adjust the distance between your subject, play around with the exposure triangle, and find time to practice as much as possible. With dedication and practice, you can capture those special moments that will inspire others for years to come."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: ... portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .

Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut.

During World War II, the Federal budget skyrocketed to over 90 billion, an unprecedented amount at the time. This spending was necessary to fund the war effort and provide military personnel with the resources and equipment they needed to fight. In more recent times, the 2009 Federal budget was another notable high-cost budget. This budget was passed in the midst of the Great Recession, which required significant amounts of government spending to stimulate the economy and prevent a total collapse. The budget included funding for measures such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which provided funding for infrastructure projects, tax incentives, and other initiatives designed to create jobs and boost economic growth. In addition to these two examples, there have been numerous other high-cost Federal budgets throughout US history. These budgets have typically been passed during times of crisis, whether that be war, economic downturns, or other emergencies that required significant government intervention. While these budgets may have represented a significant burden on the government and taxpayers at the time, they were often necessary to provide critical support and resources during challenging times. Despite the high cost, the benefits of these budgets can be seen in the long-term outcomes achieved through government intervention and support."},{"instruction":"The sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle, or copper (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper), and boiled, usually for about one hour.

The lack of pathology evidence is just one of these hurdles. It is important for prosecutors to have all the necessary evidence to build a strong case against the shooter. Without this evidence, it becomes difficult to prove the shooter guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The incident has once again brought to the forefront the issue of shootings and violence that takes place in the name of war. It is important for governments and authorities to take measures to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. It is also important for them to ensure that justice is served to victims of such incidents. The lack of evidence in this case highlights the importance of having proper systems and procedures in place to ensure that justice is always served, regardless of the circumstances.

One of the most important is to install and maintain smoke detectors. Working smoke detectors can alert you to the presence of a fire, giving you time to escape and call for help if necessary. If you live in an area where lightning is a frequent problem, it is also a good idea to consider installing a lightning protection system. With lightning strikes being a real threat, you can help protect your home and family from damage by having a professional install a system that can divert the electrical charge away from your home, reducing the risk of damage or fire. Another important safety measure is to consider having a home sprinkler system installed. While smoke detectors are a great way to alert you to a fire, sprinklers can actually help extinguish the fire before it gets out of control. This can not only help to save your home, but it can also help prevent injuries or loss of life. Finally, it is important to teach your children about fire safety. One of the best ways to do this is by teaching them not to play with lighters or matches. Children can be naturally curious, but it is important for them to understand that these items are not toys and can be extremely dangerous when handled improperly. Taking these steps can help to protect your home and family, and give you peace of mind knowing that you have done everything you can to help ensure their safety."},{"instruction":"Theorganization“NewNordicFood”undertheNordicCouncilofMinisters,gaveitsprestigiousawardtoHotelArcticin2009.OtherrestaurantsintherunningincludedCopenhagenrestaurantNomawithtwoMichelinstars.

The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage: marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships. The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as biology, psychology, demography or sociology.

It should be looked at for Jack Cassidy's role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo. After all, Columbo meets his match in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying general store owner/widow who would blackmail him for money. Rather than losing more money, he kills her. It is very entertaining to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's familiarity as Columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years. What television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters.

Not only does a damaged coconut affect its appearance, but it can also affect its taste and quality. The first thing to check for when buying a coconut is whether it is free of cracks. Cracks can cause the coconut to leak out its delicious water and also make it vulnerable to bacteria and mold growth. Also, if there are cracks in the coconut, there is a high chance that the flesh inside is dry and stale. It is also essential to check for other forms of damage, such as holes or soft spots. These can also make the coconut vulnerable to microbial growth, which can cause it to spoil quickly. Another important factor to consider is the weight of the coconut. Generally, a good quality coconut should feel heavy for its size, which means that the coconut is fresh and filled with water. If the coconut feels light, it may have lost its water content, and the flesh inside may have dried out. While shopping for coconuts, it's also important to look for ones with a clear liquid inside. This indicates that the coconut has not fermented, and its water is still fresh to drink. In conclusion, when it comes to buying coconuts, make sure you choose ones that are free of cracks and other forms of damage. This way, you can enjoy a fresh and delicious coconut, whether you’re using it for cooking or drinking its water."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that about [The Olive Grove eatType pub; The Olive Grove food French; The Olive Grove priceRange high; The Olive Grove area riverside; The Olive Grove familyFriendly yes].","output":"The Olive Grove is a high-priced, family-friendly eatery serving French cuisine in a riverside location."},{"instruction":"What are the disadvantages of Vicks inhalers?

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Instead of saying \\"You never listen to me,\\" try saying \\"I feel unheard when we have conversations.\\" This framing shifts the focus away from blame and places emphasis on your feelings and experiences. Remaining calm when you disagree is another key aspect of respectful communication. It's natural to have differing opinions, but it's important to approach these conversations with a level head. If you feel yourself becoming upset, take a break and come back to the conversation when you feel calmer. Negotiating a rule when you disagree can be an effective way to reach a compromise. For example, if your parents want you to be home by 10 pm but you feel like 11 pm is more reasonable, suggest a compromise of 10:30 pm. This way, both parties feel heard and respected. Finally, it's important to avoid putting down your parents' beliefs and ideas. Even if you don't agree with them, it's important to show respect and understanding.

Rosie-Ann was accused of causing her sister's death after their vehicles collided while overtaking a slow-moving lorry. This devastating event took place just a few months following the death of their soldier brother. After a lengthy trial, a jury found Rosie-Ann not guilty of causing death by careless driving and sympathetically advised her to \\"live your life, be happy.\\" Following the verdict, Rosie-Ann expressed relief that she had been cleared of any wrongdoing. However, the Crown Prosecution Service was criticised for bringing the case to trial in the first place. Nevertheless, the inquiry concluded that Rosie-Ann didn't act carelessly and wasn't at fault for the accident. Losing a loved one is a harrowing experience, and being accused of causing their death could be overwhelming. Although Rosie-Ann was cleared of the accusation, the pain of losing her sister will continue to haunt her.

Start by reviewing the certification requirements and exam outline so that you know what topics will be covered on the test. You can find this information on the certification provider's website or by contacting their customer service. Consider taking a test prep course or using study materials to refresh your knowledge of the subject matter. Make sure to allow enough time to study and practice before the exam. 2. Take the Test When you're ready, schedule your exam and arrive at the testing center with all the necessary materials, including your identification and any allowed test aids.

Remember that your certification provider can help you understand your results and provide advice on how to improve. 4. Renew Your Certification To maintain your certification, you typically need to renew it every few years by taking another exam or completing ongoing education requirements. Check the certification provider's website for information on renewal deadlines and requirements. Make a plan in advance to ensure that you have enough time to complete the necessary activities before your certification expires. Consider taking advantage of opportunities for continuing education or attending conferences and workshops to earn credits toward your renewal. 5. Use Your Certification Once you've earned and renewed your certification, make sure to use it! Highlight your credentials on your resume, LinkedIn profile, and business cards.

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface.
