The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes. The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the Atlas moth and the White Witch (Thysania agrippina).

Find out more about progressive preschools. Try Montessori methods. Explore ReggioEmilio pedagogy. Learn more about Waldorf schools. Try cooperative learning groups.","output":"As a parent, you want to provide the best care for your child during their developmental years. This is where developmental child care comes in. It focuses on the cognitive, emotional, and social growth of a child. If you want to delve deeper and be more involved in your child's education, exploring progressive preschools is an excellent option. One of the foremost methods used in progressive preschools is Montessori. Dr. Maria Montessori was an Italian physician and educator who believed that children should learn at their own pace, in their own way, and with materials that are specifically designed for their cognitive and emotional growth. In Montessori schools, the environment is carefully designed to support each child's individual learning journey. Another approach to progressive preschools is the Reggio-Emilio pedagogy. This method emphasizes collaboration, exploration, and creativity. It is based on the belief that we learn through experience and that children's learning should be meaningful and relevant to their individual interests and ideas. Waldorf schools operate under the philosophy that academic education should be integrated with the arts, and that children should be encouraged to explore diverse subject matter. This approach emphasizes the importance of nurturing imagination and creativity in children. Cooperative learning groups are another aspect of progressive preschools that encourage teamwork and socialization. Children work together to complete a task, share their ideas, and learn from one another. In conclusion, exploring progressive preschools is an excellent way to get involved in and support your child's educational journey. By learning more about methods such as Montessori, Reggio-Emilio, and Waldorf, parents can make informed decisions about their child's education. Encouraging cooperative learning groups can also help children develop social skills and build confidence through teamwork."},{"instruction":"Read about our industryleading Customer Service Please remove spaces between words.","output":"Readaboutourindustry-leadingCustomerService."},{"instruction":"Straight Outta Compton is a 2015 American biographical film directed by F.

Additionally, some individuals may have mixed ancestry that is not accounted for in these statistics. It is also worth noting that the size of these groups can vary depending on the location.

Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support.

Show more gratitude. Stop comparing yourself to others. Quit caring what people think. Be less of a perfectionist. Focus on the journey. Find your purpose.","output":"In today's fast-paced society, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life. We often find ourselves comparing our achievements to those of others, striving for perfection, and caring too much about what others think. It's easy to lose sight of what's important in life and become overwhelmed by negative self-talk. The first step to breaking this cycle is to be patient with yourself. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your goals be achieved overnight. Recognize that progress takes time and celebrate even the smallest victories along the way. This will help you to stay motivated and focused on your goals. One way to stay positive and motivated is to show gratitude for what you have. Count your blessings and appreciate the little things in life. This will help you to maintain a positive attitude and improve your overall well-being. Studies have shown that expressing gratitude can lead to increased happiness and improved mental health. Comparing yourself to others is another trap that is easy to fall into. Remember that everyone has their own journey and struggles. Focus on your own progress and achievements, and celebrate the accomplishments of others without feeling like it diminishes your own. Quit caring too much about what others think. It can be tough to ignore the opinions of others, but it's important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. Don't be afraid to be true to yourself, pursue your passions, and take risks. Perfectionism can also be a hurdle to achieving your goals. Don't let the fear of failure hold you back from pursuing your dreams. Recognize that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Keep in mind that progress is more valuable than perfection. Another key to achieving a fulfilling life is to focus on the journey, not just the destination. Enjoy the process of growth and self-discovery. Embrace the challenges and setbacks that come your way, as they offer valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. Finally, finding your purpose can be a powerful motivator. Take the time to explore your passions and interests, and pursue activities that bring you joy and a sense of purpose. It may take time to find your calling, but the journey will be worth it. In conclusion, by being patient with yourself, showing gratitude, stopping comparisons, quitting caring what people think, being less of a perfectionist, focusing on the journey, and finding your purpose, you can break free from limiting beliefs and live a fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"(CNN What are highlight points for this article?","output":"I am sorry, I cannot provide the highlight points for the article without knowing the specific article you are referring to.

This movie, about a medical examiner who investigates his friend's mysterious death in a car accident, has the complete receipt for a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, poor humor and no drama. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a TV station notable for dishing out lowbudgeted and campy madeforTV movies such as this one. TV movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the Big Screen. But, this movie sure hit all sour tastes.

Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and overschematically represented. What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince.

They are known for their simple way of life, which is based on traditional values, and a strong sense of community. The Amish are currently living in 28 U.S. states and Ontario, with Pennsylvania having the largest Amish population, followed closely by Ohio. Despite their reluctance to embrace modern society, the Amish are slowly but surely expanding their communities, with New York, Kentucky, Illinois, and Kansas seeing the largest net gain in Amish households since 2006. This is a testament to the enduring appeal of the Amish way of life, which emphasizes family, faith, and hard work. The growing Amish population in New York is particularly notable. While the state has long been home to Amish communities, the recent surge in numbers suggests that more and more people are drawn to the simplicity and sense of belonging that the Amish way of life offers. For those who are not familiar with the Amish, their lifestyle can seem strange and even archaic. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the Amish have a deep respect for nature, for each other, and for the traditions that have sustained their community for centuries. As the Amish population continues to grow across the United States, it will be interesting to see how their traditional values and way of life will interact with modern society. One thing is for certain: the Amish will continue to be a unique and fascinating cultural group that will always be worth learning about."},{"instruction":"@annosuperstar Need Anno time too.

Charity accused of sending 12.4 million to Hamas under humanitarian cloak. Assistant AG: These sentences should serve as a strong warning","output":"The Holy Land Foundation (HLF), which has been referred to as the largest Muslim charity organization in the United States, made headlines in recent years due to its alleged ties to the Hamas terrorist group. The charity was accused of using humanitarian work as a cover-up to funnel money to Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the United States government. In 2008, the charity leaders faced trial, resulting in five of them receiving prison sentences ranging from 15 to 65 years. The accusations were that the HLF had sent approximately 12.4 million to Hamas, which used the funds for violent activities against Israel. The Assistant Attorney General at the time, Kenneth Wainstein, emphasized that these sentences should serve as a warning, highlighting how important it was for charity organizations to abide by the law, especially when the funds might end up being used to support terrorist actions. Since then, several Muslim organizations within the United States have started to question the motives behind the HLF trial, claiming that the verdicts were politically motivated and that there was no evidence that the charity funds went to Hamas. These organizations continued to voice their concerns, stating that the verdicts against the HLF leaders were unjust and that they should have been freed. Regardless of the various opinions surrounding the case, it remains an important example of the government's commitment to preventing financial channels from being used to support terrorist activities. It also demonstrated that charities and humanitarian organizations must act in a transparent and legal manner to uphold their work's integrity and legitimacy. In conclusion, the story of the Holy Land Foundation is one that will continue to divide opinions, but it highlights the importance of vigilance and awareness when it comes to the financing of charitable work. The severe sentences handed down to the charity's leaders should remind us all that supporting terrorism is a grave offense and that the law enforcement agencies will continue to take a firm stance against those who engage in such activities."},{"instruction":"ere is some data: Loch Fyne food Japanese; Loch Fyne customer rating high; Loch Fyne area riverside; Loch Fyne near The Rice Boat.

All seven of the Toffees' corners at the Etihad were poorly executed, failing to give their team any advantage. Manager Roberto Martinez had admitted that he prefers to score from open play, and some fans and critics alike believe that his neglect of set pieces may have cost Everton the match. While it's true that set pieces are not the be-all and end-all of football, they can make a significant difference in a game such as this one. Unfortunately for Everton, their lack of prowess in set pieces was not the only issue they faced. Defender Phil Jagielka's challenge on James Milner led to a penalty, allowing City to take the lead and snatch the win from Everton. It's clear that Everton will need to work on their set-piece strategies if they hope to compete at the highest level. While Martinez's focus on open play is admirable, it's important to remember that a well-executed set piece can be just as effective in scoring goals and winning games."},{"instruction":"Melbourne Melbourne universities have campuses all over Australia and some internationally.

American eggs are kept refrigerated for safety reasons, whereas UK eggs are stored at room temperature.","output":"Eggs are a staple food around the world and are consumed in many different ways. However, there are significant differences in how eggs are regulated and treated in different countries. For example, eggs in the UK would be illegal in the US because they are not cleaned, and American eggs don't comply with UK laws because they are cleaned. In the UK, eggs are not washed or cleaned before they reach the supermarket shelves. This is because the eggs have a protective layer called a bloom or cuticle that prevents bacteria from entering the egg. Cleaning or washing the egg could damage this protective layer and increase the risk of bacterial contamination. Therefore, UK eggs are stored at room temperature and do not require refrigeration. On the other hand, American eggs are washed and treated with chemicals to remove any dirt or bacteria that may be present on the eggshell. This removes the protective cuticle, which means the eggs are more vulnerable to contamination. To compensate for this, American eggs must be refrigerated at all times to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. These differences in regulation and treatment of eggs are due to variations in food safety laws and cultural preferences. However, it does raise the question of which approach is safer. While there is no clear answer, both the US and UK have low rates of egg-related illnesses, suggesting that both approaches are effective. In conclusion, eggs are an essential part of the global diet, but their regulation and treatment can vary significantly between countries. Therefore, it is important to be aware of these differences when cooking and consuming eggs in different parts of the world."},{"instruction":"During the 16th and 17th centuries slave traders began to raid the region as part of the expansion of the Saharan and Nile River slave routes.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twentynine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with GeorgesCharles de Heeckeren d'Anthes.

In recent weeks, candidates have been defending America's failed Cuba policy, making themselves look quite silly in the process. It seems that only candidate Ron Paul has the right idea about Cuba. For decades, American policy toward Cuba has been to isolate and punish the island nation. This policy has been a complete failure, accomplishing nothing but keeping the Cuban people in poverty and under the thumb of the Castro regime. Despite this, many candidates for the Republican nomination seem determined to cling to this outmoded approach. Ron Paul, however, has consistently spoken out against America's failed Cuba policy. He argues that the best way to bring about change in Cuba is through engagement, not isolation. By opening up trade and travel with Cuba, the United States can foster greater economic ties and provide an alternative model to the Castro regime. It is unfortunate that other candidates have failed to see the wisdom of Ron Paul's approach.

Cut the Lumber for the Tabletop: Start by cutting your lumber into desired sizes. Arrange the boards on a flat surface to fit snugly together without gaps. 2. Mark the Pocket Hole Locations: Once you have arranged the boards, mark the locations where you want to drill pocket holes. Make sure that you mark them on the bottom side of the tabletop and along the joints of each board. 3. Adjust the Kreg Jig Depth: Set your Kreg Jig to the correct depth, depending on the thickness of the boards you're using. This will ensure that you create a strong joint. 4. Adjust the Jig Placement & Drill the Pocket Holes: Position the Kreg Jig on the marked spots on the boards and drill pocket holes. Ensure that you make the pocket holes in opposite directions to prevent the lumber from splitting. 5. Lay Out the Boards & Attach with Screws: Arrange the boards in a pattern you like, and then attach them using 2.5-inch Kreg screws. Work your way from the center outwards, so you don't end up with any bowing or warping. 6. Sand the Surface: Sand your tabletop surface, starting with coarse sandpaper to remove any rough spots, and then move on to fine sandpaper until you achieve a smooth surface. 7. Cut the Breadboard Ends: Cut the breadboard ends to the desired length, making sure that they fit flush with the tabletop's ends. 8. Attach the Breadboard Ends: Secure the breadboard ends using your Kreg Jig and screws.

Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation. Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semiofficial recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and English language is a compulsory subject.

The elderly woman was lowered into a scalding bath, leading to her death. Yesterday, the care home was fined just £5,000 at Flintshire Magistrates. The court was informed that the home had no effective control over water temperature, which could have been as high as 50C, while the safe level is 44C. The company that owned this care home is now in liquidation with no assets. The judge presiding over the case remarked that it was unlikely that the fine imposed would ever be collected. This appalling incident has once again highlighted the carelessness of some care homes, where the vulnerable elderly are placed in the hands of poorly trained, understaffed and underfunded facilities. This has renewed the conversation on how we can provide quality care and ensure the safety of our elderly population, especially those residing in care homes. Regulators must tighten regulations to ensure that care homes are held accountable for their actions, and those who break the rules should face severe penalties. There should be a thorough investigation into the care homes' practices before they are permitted to operate. Furthermore, the government must invest in more resources and provide stricter guidance to care homes on how to maintain the safety and well-being of their residents. It is important to remember that the elderly in our society should be cherished and looked after with the utmost respect and care, and not treated as dispensable objects. In conclusion, the death of Beatrice Morgan is a tragedy that could have been prevented. The inadequacies of this care home were shocking and the fine imposed upon it negligible. Let us hope that regulators and policymakers take swift action to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future."},{"instruction":"did n't matter how much time she did spend with Severus , she still wanted more .

Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; lightframed, egglaying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fastgrowing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a wellfleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egglaying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.

Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental slop (Hulme)[citation needed] or an old bitch gone in the teeth (Pound) and wanted to go back to a more manly, authoritarian society such as (they believed) existed in the Middle Ages. Postmodern critics who are selfdescribed antihumanists, such as JeanFrançois Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal, suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger).

The film falters in nearly every aspect. From the confusing storyline to the incredibly creepy and unappealing character designs, it's hard to find anything positive to say about this movie. The CGI work is poorly executed, making the actors look more like strange, anthropomorphic humanoids rather than graceful feline creatures. The music is equally as forgettable, with none of the songs sticking out as particularly memorable or well-composed. The entire movie feels like a surreal fever dream, and not in a good way. The pacing is slow and plodding, with no real sense of direction or momentum. Even the talented cast, including Judy Dench, Ian McKellen, and Jennifer Hudson, can't save this movie from being an utter disaster. In fact, some of their performances are downright cringe-worthy, with awkward cat-like movements and exaggerated facial expressions that border on parody. Overall, Cats is a misfire of epic proportions. It's hard to imagine anyone could enjoy this strange and off-putting mess of a movie."},{"instruction":"Agnes Kant, office, Socialist Party (Netherlands); Socialist Party (Netherlands), leader, Emile Roemer What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","output":"Agnes Kant used to work in the office of the Socialist Party (Netherlands) while Emile Roemer was the leader of the same party."},{"instruction":"During the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989, Chinese student demonstrators in Beijing built a 10meter version of the Statue of Liberty to symbolize their struggle.

Chris Taylor, 23, to prove condition won’t hold him back. Heartshock device under his skin similar to footballer Fabrice Muamba.","output":"Chris Taylor, a 23-year-old runner, is about to embark on a truly unique marathon attempt despite a serious health risk. He plans to prove that his condition will not hold him back, and will run a marathon with a heart-shock device similar to that of footballer Fabrice Muamba installed under his skin. A heart-shock device, also known as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), is a small device inserted under the skin near the collarbone. The device is designed to detect and correct potentially dangerous heart rhythms. Muamba’s career in football was cut short after he collapsed due to a cardiac arrest during a match. The event prompted him to have an ICD fitted, as would be the case with Taylor. Taylor, who has a hereditary heart condition, will attempt to run the Manchester Marathon with his ICD. While he is aware of the risk involved, he is determined to go ahead with his plan. His aim is to show that living with heart disease does not mean a life without exercise or physical exertion. It is not uncommon for people with heart conditions to avoid rigorous physical activity. But as Taylor puts it, “I want to inspire others with heart conditions to show them that they can do something they want to do. Even with my condition, I’ve decided that there is no reason why I can’t attempt a marathon. I just have to take precautions, listen to my body, and adjust my pace as necessary.” The fact that Taylor is willing to take on such a challenge despite his health risks is admirable. It’s refreshing to see someone not let their condition define them or hold them back. It may serve as an inspiration to others with similar conditions to take calculated risks and challenge themselves to go beyond what they thought was possible. In conclusion, Taylor’s marathon attempt is not only unique but also brave. He is a true inspiration to others with hereditary heart conditions, and his story serves as a reminder that with the right mindset, anything is possible. It’s important for people with heart conditions to consult with their doctors before engaging in physical activities, and to take on tasks that are safe and feasible."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sentence: The cat sat on the windowsill in the sunlight.

During his tenure, he played a crucial role in steering the Iranian economy through the tumultuous eight-year war with Iraq. Moussavi was known for his efforts to modernize and develop the country's infrastructure, industries, and institutions. His policies helped to build a strong foundation for the country's economic growth and development. However, Moussavi's hardline stance on Iran's nuclear program put him at odds with the international community. He vehemently opposed any move to suspend the country's enrichment program, insisting that it was essential for Iran's energy security and sovereignty. Despite his past accomplishments, Moussavi has been absent from politics for the past 10 years. His absence has been attributed to his involvement in the 2009 Iranian presidential elections, marred by allegations of fraud and rigging. While Moussavi's contributions to Iran's economic growth and development cannot be denied, his political legacy remains controversial. His staunch opposition to suspending the country's nuclear program has earned him both admirers and detractors, reflecting the deep divisions within Iranian society over the issue."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following review?
