I‚Äôve found that these slim plastic bottles work well for storing dry foods like rice, lentils, etc. (in fact, anything that will fit through the narrow neck).

What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"Okay hi.. my name is Truly‚Ä¶ I will be discussing my experience with a highly gifted IQ.. I've took many many IQ tests( mensa, wechler, etc) ranging from 149 - 157 HOW I LEARN; I essentially learn by having by coming to the conclusion myself rather than just being told the answer and that is a pro and a con since I'm authentic but depending on how complex the concept is ‚Äúslow‚Äù but I definitely see the flaws in my intellect‚Ä¶ which falls into Flaws in intellect; lmy memory ~ I need to be invested to remember it otherwise I will not at all‚Ä¶ but I will recall it when it is brought back up but re forget‚Ä¶ which also builds bad habits of not needing to study since it's something I can retain when re introduced‚Ä¶ another flaw in my intellect is my Spatial reasoning ~ it is only efficient when its an a intuitive concept for example‚Ä¶ if someone was explaining or telling a story I will visually see it and feel it's emotion almost perfectly but when it's something like ‚Äúput this cube together‚Äù it's barely above average Strengths in intellect: My Logical reasoning is very profound; I've been on par and or above people with 160+ IQ Logical reasoning‚Ä¶ how I scale this is with ‚Äúconversation‚Äù when me and a person are having a conversation and its something complex I ask myself who is winning this conversation ( meaning who is refuting and or adding on the most ideas, while interested ) and I also take into account who had the most prep to the conversation like did this person study this as prerequisite to this conversation‚Ä¶ or did they just hear about this while I had prep‚Ä¶ but regardless who I am talking too I've never falling behind to the point I understand what's being told to me.. even when I talk to my cousin with a 164 IQ and he is older and more experienced and wise being 32 while I am 16 I've never falling short since being 15 ( no age earlier tho ) but yes I gave extremely good Logical reasoning. The rest is pretty average for someone with a 150 + IQ Things I am fascinated by: I love psychology, philosophy, and theoretical sciences. When it comes down to psychology not only is this very innate for me ( having a 150+ IQ but high EQ being 145 ish ) psychology and it's core principles fits my intuitive thoughts perfectly since I was 2 or 3.. Philosophy is something I absolutely love it gets me to think ü§î and think and expand my way of thinking but I've never been unable to answer a single philosophical question I was ever dealt with.. theoretical science is what I've just gotten into ( few weeks ) I've been able to come to conclusions that almost no one would think a 16yr would come to‚Ä¶ like no one.. I've formulated and Conceptualised a lot of new and re used concepts‚Ä¶ which is why I say ‚Äúalmost every thought we come up with is just borrowed but we interpret it differently‚Äù but I've tied in reasoning with people 160 and 170 IQ in end results though‚Ä¶ I have the internet (though I wouldve came to the conclusion regardless) at disposal while they had to read books and or come up with it raw thought..

If you like watching tv series and have been following the trends since a lot of time, I think the the perception what a best show has been changing throughout the years, new themes emerge, and you grow older, as tv shows are not like movies, sometimes, it was like 2 tears between two seasons in a tv show. I remember watching mini tv sitcoms and liking them very much, the classics like How I met your mother, Two and a half men, Friends, Scrubs, Community. Those were very wholesome, funny tv shows that were comfy to watch at home. Then the dramas obviously, breaking bad, House M.D., Game of Thrones, Burn Notice, Six Feet Under, Dexter. And who could forget Star Trek? Doctor Who? Heroes? Fringe? Those were amazing as well. Then came the fiction/historical ones. Like the Game of Thrones, Peaky Blinders, The Song of Ice and Fire, The Vikings. Hard to name even a few to say that those were the best tv shows.

Most males finish growing between 16 and 17 years old, females between 15 and 16 years old. Technically, your body is not fully finished developing until 21 years old, so I will not say that it is impossible, just extremely rare. Generally you will not grow anymore once you have made it through puberty. Unless you were a late bloomer (didn‚Äôt start puberty until you were 15 or 16 years old), then by the age of 19, you are probably 2‚Äì3 years beyond the final stages of puberty. Your height is greatly based on the height of your biological mother and father‚Äôs height. In some people, it skips a generation and your height may be determined by your biological grandmother and grandfather instead. So for example, if your mother is 5‚Äô2‚Äù and your father is 5‚Äô7‚Äù, then it is highly unlikely that you will grow beyond 5‚Äô7‚Äù."},{"instruction":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

First of all, the people started booing and screaming as Amanda(the nurse) and I maneuvered the young girl to be able to evaluate her. Second. It literally took 20+ minutes for the camera operator/manager to turn on the theaters lights. (They never stopped the film!) Once the ambulance arrived we had the patient(Rachelle) stabilized and she was transported to the hospital. The next thing is what really blew me away, there where actually people demanding that the movie be restarted AND ticket price be refunded because of ‚Äútheir inconvenience.‚Äù The theater offered free access to the next regularly scheduled showing or a showing in the future. But no refunds. Some ungrateful people weren't satisfied. I never felt so angry and baffled by the behavior of others in the light of a young pregnant womans life fighting episode. To be fair, there were those that came up and congratulated us for helping. PS. It turned out that the young lady had suffered a seizure caused by a imbalance of her insulin levels.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","output":"This is an interesting question because I remember as a child some of the paranoid happenings which my narcissist mom played on me as a child. Never did my mother felt the need to show any emotional support as we were little and trying to figure ourselves out. Instead she mocked me if I strutted out in front of the family due to this little red jacket I had on. She and my dad would hide behind people as I was walking down the sidewalk of a busy group of people while my narc mom e and others would hide from me? Naturally, I must have been less than 5 years old I would look back to make sure they were back there but seeing them laughing and claiming they were playing a prank scared me at first but it didn‚Äôt stop. It showed lack of any compassion or love not to do something so frightening to think they would abandoned me? After a while I learned to detach myself from the selfish games which they enjoyed seeing me question them as I turned around? Nothing, in this world would I ever do this to a child because it would show lack of concern or meant to intimidate me to the point I would cry but I didn‚Äôt since I picked up even then these are not normal parents but fools to make out of their children. Later, and I mean later in the future would I learned who I was dealing with devious, selfish and never worthwhile individuals as these self-absorbed parents that rather hurt their children with their nonsense and foolish games for their own amusement instead of giving out the feeling of comfort, and stability in a family -they rather pushed the concept of lack of positive interaction with them. I became more and more aware of this type of personality and as I got older and started to take care of me I became detached from them as I became angry at how little was done for me or any of my sisters but ‚ÄúI‚Äù decided to take care of myself to wash my clothes, dry them and ironed them. Also, polish my shoes so I could look and be confident by my appearance to be presentable in school as any other child of 9 years old in grade school. This was just the start of my being independent to take care of me including savings from my lunch money a quarter out of the fifty cents which the quarter I saved for the following week. Each savings went for things I needed at school from pencils or paper since, my parents lacked in the common sense to help us achieve even school supplies and I also joined the US Savings Bond Group of children by buying stamps which were 10 cents a piece to maintain that booklet up-to-date. Unfortunately, due to circumstances our school was one of the best in Miami, Fl and when we moved to a recently purchased home we had to go to another school that never had the kind of programs that would developed our sense of pride in savings with the US Stamp Album which would have yield 300 once it matured. Perhaps, it was for the best since if my parents knew about it, which I kept secret, she might have tried to steal this booklet so she can gain the funds from my savings which I did on my own from not having dessert but saving that money. So I had only saved 11.62 cents form the booklet but that was still an accomplishment despite not finishing the US Stamp Collection for my future. Detachment didn‚Äôt come into play until I was older and wiser and refused o be with them. Before that time I seldom had a choice to go anywhere with them or remain at home unless my mom‚Äôs 4th husband decided to stay at home. otherwise I would go with them due to the safety since he was interested in me in my teens and tried a number of times to mess with me. Remember detachment came as I got older and can make ‚Äúdecisions‚Äù for myself like staying home due to being sick or having to study for a test. I didn‚Äôt always wanted to be around them nor leave with all of them for any reason. Once I finally got a car I was my own free agent and can do as I pleased since I was in my 20s and not have to stick with them at all."},{"instruction":"Does 'nick' mean 'idiot' in British English?","output":"No, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever meant that.

Usually winter is supposed to be the best time to visit Sept to Feb. I honestly do not know how the weather is going to be from April to July.

Most bhutanese speak decent Hindi and English is very commonly used...so you should have no trouble. The immigration office is open till 4pm and work mon to fri - so plan and time your enrty to bhutan. Initially you get a 15 day permit to Thimpu and Paro only. At Thimpu, you can get the permit extended and can get special permit to other parts of bhutan (at thimpu you have list all the provines you would like to vist - get a map beforehand and plan your journey). you can extend your permit by a max of 15 days. So 30 days is all you get per visit.At the Phuntsuling border, don't ask anybody anything, just confidently stroll across the border by foot. If asked, just say that you are Indian. But pls carry your passport and one other id proof like DL and plenty of passport size photographs. Once you are through the border, you will need to ask for the Immigration office which is a 15 min walk frm the border.Their currency is equal to INR and both are easily used there. I was able to withdraw INR from my SBI debit cardCheap motels cost about 300 - 350 rupees a night. Always negotiate. In smaller places you can get decent rooms for even 200.

One. Two. Three. One. The Keystone pipeline is one of two pipelines with the same source and leading to the same refinery. That refinery is already getting the oil it needs from a new pipeline already in service. Two. The oil from the Keystone pipeline is not for domestic use, it is for export via Houston. This has NO EFFECT on America‚Äôs energy independence. Three. The company behind the Keystone pipeline has a history of running its pipelines right through the middle of Indian lands by force. This particular pipeline is contained within a right-of-way, essentially a land grant of Indian lands, and runs beneath the water reservoir upon which the Reservation depends for its water. The oil carried by the pipeline is toxic and dense (little more than asphalt), so if the pipeline leaks, the oil will sink unseen to the bottom of the reservoir, thereby invisibly poisoning the reservoir. It could have easily been sited differently, but wasn‚Äôt, so this is a feature, not a bug. If you are a capitalist, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline. It takes Indian lands from the control of the owner for the sole benefit of an international corporation, without compensation. That is inconsistent with capitalism, and is consistent with socialism. If you support self-determination, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline. The owners of that land should have the right to decline to have the pipeline, an existential threat, be routed under the reservoir when better, more accessible, and less risky alternative routes exist. If you support the Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline. The GOP tried to pass a bill banning protests over infrastructure projects, making protesting illegal. If you support American freedom over the rights of a Canadian company, Essentially all the benefits of this project go to a Canadian company. If you do not support the federal government confiscating Indian lands, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline."},{"instruction":"Can India, Russia, North Korea, & China together defeat the USA alone in a war, if it happens in 2025?

It is based on a recent research of a most poisonous gas ever discovered, carried out by top Indian scientists. It is said that this new gas will be soon added to the periodic table. Its radiations are extremely dangerous and leads to a very painful death on its exposure. Surprisingly its found only in India and is freely available in the south in abundance. Its name is given as 'STINK'. This is the gas found in every south Indian individual (specially Andhra) and its proven to be the most deadly and most poisonous gas ever discovered. Scientists from all over the world wil be soon visiting India for a deep research on it. This gas will be collected in a big Aluminium chamber coated with each south Indian's shit. This coating gives an additional overall strength. The chamber will contain sum low budget explosives and dynamites that are remotely controlled. It is estimated that just a 0.5 cubic metres of its volume can wipe out half the United States's population. This 'stink' directly affects the brain and trachea and blocks trachea entirely by sum chemical reactions around it. This leads to death of the victim on the spot.

There are many other juniors who picked up the skill or it is cheaper to hire from the market to sustain the maintenance work.Some companies have a mandatory percentage of workforce that needs to be trimmed every year. It allows them to rebalance their budgets, priorities and workforce alignments to meet their next set of deliverables.The mandatory trimming happens through Performance Improvement Plan or Reorganisation or Burnout or informal gaslighting. Each culture is different.All these dynamics have taught the skilled workers that they are totally replaceable. This forced them to quote insane compensation expectations as they know it is for a year or two before the company plays its cards.Looking at the high compensation figures in media every programmer assumes there is a lot of demand for their profile and that is eternal. They don't understand the niche. They don't understand the temporary nature of those high paying jobs.Now, I am not saying it is good, bad or ugly.

Depression drove me to eat, and because I had no friends I'd just eat more. I literally eat every second of every day. Right now, I'm 17, now homeschooled when I should be playing football in my junior year of high school, and bedbound. After a while, you stop being fat, and just think of yourself as a head on a pillow, not a massively misshapen body that bulges out in every direction, and you feel even smaller than a normal human. I'm somewhere over 1,200 pounds right now, but I dont know or care how much. When I could walk, I used to have to hold on to walls and tables and swing my legs around eachother. My knees also got messed up, because the fat on my legs kept them at over a 90‚Å∞ angle, so my knees always kept buckling inward, especially under the size of my frame. I didnt have to wear shoes, I used to wear flip flops all the time, because I used to live in miami, where literally everyone wore flip flops to school every day, but then we moved to new Hampshire, and I literally Only had flip flops. I really didnt need to wear shorts or even closed toed shoes, because my fat acted like a heavy coat. I had maybe 5 pairs and one pair of sneakers before I stopped wearing shoes, because my feet couldn't fit in even the biggest size, and then we moved back to miami, and the heat killed me. It used to be hot in florida, but when you have to cart around another 800 pounds, you Really realize just how hot it can get. I was only 16 when I had my heart attack, in part to the heat and my size, and I only ever walked a handful of times after that. I'd rather not go on with this, but you can probably guess all the other stuff, like not being able to find clothes, being picked on in school, and just the everyday struggle of having to calculate my every movement to simultaneously not embarrass myself and also not put too much of a strain on my heart. I know, I'm a teenager and I shouldn't have to already worry about my heart, but recently I can feel it beating out of my chest more and more for no reason, and I think I've probably done permanent damage to it, but with food being my only friend, it's just going to have to put up with it."},{"instruction":"w do you celebrate National Housekeeping Week?","output":"National house keeping week ?

My son in law is a Costco manager. I‚Äôve heard umpteen stories over the years about entitled customers."},{"instruction":"Why has indexed shifting displaced traditional friction shifting on bicycles?","output":"Because it‚Äôs soooooo much more practical and easy to use. In the quite old times, say 1960s-‚Äô70s, gear levers had a smooth friction that acted symmetrically in both directions. In one direction, it prevented the lever from moving pulled by the tension of the cable. In the opposite direction it just made changing gears harder. The movement was continuous and smooth, if a little hard. There were no ‚Äúticks‚Äù or notches to tell you that a gear was well engaged and you needed to have a great sensibility to make sure they were. The normal action for a proper change of gear was to move the lever slightly beyond the gear you wanted to engage, but not so much as to engage the following gear, and then move the lever a bit back, to center the derailleur with the sprocket. With the front derailleur it was easier, since generally you had only two chainrings and the only precaution was to make sure the side of the derailleur didn‚Äôt rub on the chain. It took quite some training to operate precisely and quickly this type of shifter, and errors were made also by pros, when in a rush. Add to the impracticality of this system the fact that in most bicycles, the levers were fitted to the down tube and one had to reach down to get to them. Then in the late 1970s which for me are not-so-much old times, the ‚Äúretrofriction‚Äù shifters appeared. I think they were invented by Suntour, but immediately copied by Shimano. Campagnolo stuck to its simple and refined ‚Äústandard friction‚Äù system for several years. The retro-friction acted only against the tension of the cable, therefore it didn‚Äôt make upshifting any harder than just overcoming this tension. In the Suntour system, in place of the friction acting against gear change, you had a ‚Äúratchet‚Äù which made a gentle clicking noise. Not a clear click for every gear engaged but rather a frequent ‚Äútick-tick-tick-tick‚Äù sound, marking the progress of the shifting action. With some good ear, you could easily work out how many ticks it took to engage a gear, and the shifting action was much more precise and easy to accomplish. Often, these levers were fitted to drop bar ends and were much easier to reach than those on the down tube. Cyclocrossers and bike tourers loved them. Their only drawback was that when standing on the pedals, one could end up shifting gears with your knees. That‚Äôs why cyclocross and touring drop bars had splayed extremities. Today one can buy specific bars; in the old times, more often than not, one splayed the ends of a normal road racing drop bar using a car jack. But all this was shattered by the invention of the SIS ‚ÄúShimano Indexing System‚Äù, the greatest revolution in bike mechanics of the last 50 years. With this system, you just had to move the lever (or turn-handle) until you felt a definite ‚Äúclick‚Äù and that was it -- the gear was engaged perfectly. No need to go beyond and then back, no micro-adjusting required, no musician‚Äôs ear and surgeon‚Äôs touch needed to understand if the gear was properly engaged. This way, multi-gear shifting was not any more a thing for the experts, but everyone could do it. And what about the experts? Did they get any advantage from the indexed shifting? You bet. Indexed shifting allowed to integrate the shifter levers with the brake levers on racing handlebars. Now you can shift gears with the same ease with which you brake. You can actually shift WHILE braking. Impossible with any previous system. Moreover, given the greater precision of shifting, it was possible to reduce the space between adjacent sprockets and pack more gears in the rear cog: the highest number of gears with friction levers was 7; today with indexed shifting we are at 12 and growing. So, the friction and retro-friction gear shifting were handed over to history, where they now belong."},{"instruction":"w can I transfer ownership?","output":"The process transferring a domain is to transfer your domain name from your current registrar to new [LINKED_TEXT: registrar] [URL: https://www.temok.com/].

After that complete the add to cart procedure. If you also want web hosting from the new registrar then add the web hosting option which will be provide by the new registrar. After that you need to add EPP (Extensive Provisioning Protocol) Code which will be provided by the old registrar and will be required by new registrar. After all this procedure is completed you will receive and invoice for payment from the new registrar by email. Make sure to check your spam folder and make payment following the procedure which the new domain registrar has provided you. After that registrar may require you to send payment information with scanned copy of deposit slip to specific email address like ‚Äúsales@example.com‚Äù. After that your domain transfer process would be started. The contact administering the domain would get an email to authorize the process of domain transfer. To give authorization you must be the administrative contact of the domain name as in some cases some domain registration companies keep the administrative access of domain to them in this case ask the current company to authorize the domain transfer. After the confirmation of the domain transfer the process of your domain transfer will started in the next 3 to 5 days. Normally a domain should be registered more than 60 days to be able to be transferred to a new registrar. If all these requirements are fulfilled than your domain name would be transferred within 8 to 12 working days. If you also want to transfer web hosting then there are two processes one of which will be followed If the control panel of current hosting provider is same as new hosting provider than database and files can transferred from server to server. If the hosting panels are different at both providers than your files will have to transferred to a new server.

I personally can't use it; It becomes my everything, I become obsessed about it etc etc. However I also quit drinking and what I found was that I can get the same way about drinking but the problem is is that drinking actually will start rotting my liver a lot faster. I can die from the detoxing and at the end of the day while I'm not in my right mind super stoned I am really out of my mind super drunk. With all of that said if you're struggling with drinking I would highly suggest not doing a marijuana maintenance program. All you're doing is medicating one issue with another issue. Sure you might not be the same problem you were as a drunk but more often than not I see people turn into super stoners. Super stoners don't do anything and that's the whole problem. The issue wasn't that I was this violent crazy person, I was just a vessel of flesh and bones, and the second I wasn't high the reality of the world around me got scary and I had to get more high. Considering weed is now legalized in many states it's a lot easier to obtain extremely potent concoctions of THC that can really screw up people's mental health if done excessively.

Sometimes, when a problem occurs, a pilot may spend valuable time diagnosing the autopilot instead of flying the airplane. Years ago, there was a crash of a DC-9 because the pilot and co-pilot spent so much time discussing whether a warning light was correct, or not, that the airplane flew into the ground.For modern airliners, such as Airbuses, the A/P decisions are based on the best knowledge of the engineers who designed the airplane in the first place, and the A/P make make better decisions than some pilots. Any A/P, though, should surrender gracefully, and gently when the pilot takes control after showing warning signals. It is pretty disheartening when an A/P simply disconnects itself because the airplane has become unflyable."},{"instruction":"What are the common mistakes students do while preparing for GATE?","output":"Students start preparing for [LINKED_TEXT: GATE ] [URL: http://gateschool.co.in/gate-exam-preaparation-tips/]during their college period only and yes there are many who actually work hard for it. But along with hard work another important factor is smart work. Now smart work includes detailed study, question practice and along with them knowing what mistakes you are doing while preparing and also about the mistakes that students generally do during the exam. Here are some of the common mistakes that students should avoid making: 1) Memorising and Vomiting: Since we know [LINKED_TEXT: GATE] [URL: http://gateschool.co.in/few-tips-to-crack-the-gate-examination/] is not a subjective paper hence, only memorising the theory will not help. Yes, there are some topics and formulas that have to be remembered but that doesn't come by memorising. However, practising questions will help you more for the same as GATE is all about implementation of the formula. The number of direct questions is very less. 2) Lack of Practice: The most important thing to be done is practising questions. Read and understand a topic and practice the questions. No matter how many times you study the topics but if you lack in practising questions then honestly there is no point of studying also because the weight-age of direct questions is very less. 3) Following other‚Äôs routine: Some students have this thought in their mind that if they follow what their class toppers are following then it is going to help which is not true. Yes, you can use some tricks they use, you can refer the material they are referring but when it comes to study routine then every person has different mindset and hence he must follow the routine which he is more comfortable in as it will only be most productive to him. 4) Getting confused in the material: There are many students who get confused with the study material and they try to follow the each and every book prescribed by different people or websites. This will only lead to the wastage of time. What you need to do is to ask your teachers (college/coaching) about the best books for every particular subject. Also if you are going for [LINKED_TEXT: online coaching] [URL: http://gateschool.co.in/] then just follow what the trainer says. 5) Quality/Quantity: Instead of trying to complete the whole syllabus try to jot down the most important topics of every subject of your branch. There are many topics in each subject in each branch which demands more time to study but has extremely low weight-age in the exam. So keep those topics for the end once you are done with the important topics along with questions practice based on those topics. 6) Mock Tests: The very common mistake that students do is that they skip the mock tests and keep on studying. Mock tests help your brain to settle down as per the exam environment. Hence once you are done with understanding along with the questions practice, you must appear for as many mock tests as possible. This will give you the reality check. 7) [LINKED_TEXT: No Scheduling:] [URL: http://gateschool.co.in/gate-exam-preaparation-tips/] Scheduling your study as per the subject and the topic requirements is one of the most important things to be done while preparing for GATE. Subject wise and topic wise scheduling of study hours will help you cover up the all the important topics and you will have time to go for mock tests. 8) Wasting time on one question during the exam: Some students stick glued to one question during the exam and keep on solving that question which is a very wrong approach.There is time limitation in the exam and you have to solve maximum questions in that time only with precision. Solving tough question will not fetch you more marks. You can rather solve 3 questions in the time you spent on juggling with that one question. 9) Attempting all questions without assurance: If you are confident with the answer then only mark the answer to that question. Remember, there is negative marking also for each wrong answer. Take care of these little but important factors and yes you are on your way of success.

Why?","output":"The four gospels are four different accounts of the life of Jesus. Just as if you were to pick up for different biographies of George Washington there are going to be some differences in them, so the four gospels have some differences. Different authors may decide to include different events, or may focus on different details. For example, you could find an article on a celebrity charity event that focuses on money raised, and another article that focuses on what the celebrities wore to the event. So the four gospels do have some different events and details in them. (‚ÄúDifferent‚Äù is not ‚Äúcontradictory‚Äù.) Marks appears to be the first of the four written. It is the shortest, about half the length of the other gospels, and is evenly divided between the ministry of Jesus (nothing about his birth or childhood) and the last week of his life. It treats the details of sacrificial death as having more importance that his teachings or miracles. At the time it was written the church was still in it infantry and produce manuscripts was expensive and time consuming. So Mark kept this gospel as short and concise as possible. It was better to make and distribute 5 copies of a short gospel then 1 copy of a longer one. Paul quotes from the gospel of Mark (9:31) in 55 AD in his first letter to the Corinthians (15:4) and calls it ‚Äúscripture‚Äù. So we know that gospel already existed and was in common usage as a sacred text by that time. Matthew and Luke would later expand the gospel of Mark. They both follow the structure and chronology of Mark and each repeat about 90% of Mark in their own gospels. Matthew and Luke also share about 5% of their material that is not also found in Mark. So it does not appear that Matthew or Luke know about the others gospel. Matthew has two themes. One is how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecy. Matthew had about 90 references to OT prophecies. The other is about how Jesus fulfilled the ‚ÄúKingdom‚Äù through his ministry. Luke is more intimate then the other gospels. Unlike Matthew and Mark, Luke was not an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus. His gospel comes from interviewing the people who were. So we get more details about the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù then we do in the other gospels. He gives Mary‚Äôs view, for example. of the birth and childhood of Jesus. While it is not essential to salvation, it gives us a more personal look at Jesus. John was the last gospel written. It states in the gospel that there were many other things Jesus said and did that had not been written down. John give us some of these things. Almost everything in John is unique to John. If repeats very little of what is in the other gospels, and when it does draws a different moral teachings from them. It was written near the end of John‚Äôs life (he lived into the early 2nd century AD) and so it has a more developed Christology (understanding of who Jesus was). It also deals with some heresies that were just beginning to appear in the late 1nd century AD. It has more commentary in it then the other gospel, so that makes it probably the easiest of the gospels to understand. So it is usually recommended as the first gospel to read."},{"instruction":"What is the reason for the 4 seasons?","output":"It's a lovely piece of music which introduces new people to the sometimes challenging world of classical music to many."},{"instruction":"w do you deliver effective communication?","output":"Straight up"},{"instruction":"What is your biggest fear in your hostel life?","output":"You shouldn't have any kind of fear in your hostel life.

The goal of Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes is to restore the balance of the doshas and improve the overall health of the body. There are several Ayurvedic medicines that are commonly used to manage diabetes. These include: Bitter gourd (Karela) - It contains compounds that are similar to insulin and can help regulate blood sugar levels.Fenugreek (Methi) - It contains soluble fiber and compounds that can improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels.Gymnema (Gurmar) - It can help reduce sugar cravings and lower blood sugar levels by blocking the absorption of sugar in the intestines.Cinnamon (Dalchini) - It contains compounds that can improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels.Amla (Indian Gooseberry) - It is a rich source of vitamin C and antioxidants that can help improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. It is important to note that Ayurvedic medicines should be used under the guidance of a qualified practitioner and should be used in combination with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and other lifestyle changes to effectively manage diabetes.

They lack self-respect. If a tamilian or a telgite goes and settles in the north or abroad , they do not forget their roots and their culture. Kannadigas on the other hand are basically sell-outs. They are ashamed of their kannada identity and they'd rather speak hindi with others. Nothing, like they are better than other southerners or anything. They just lack dignity and self -respect. Secondly, their movies suck. Kannada movies are as horrible and bad as the bhojpuri flicks up north.Theirs used to be good but are now awful .Their movies are like a crappy low production b-grade version of telugu films (which are already horrible). Their music is equally horrendous. No punjabi or a tamilian or a telgite intentionally promotes their culture . They are being themselves and it is completely fine. Kannadigas on the other hand try so hard to be someone else and miserably fail. You go to AP, Punjab or TN , you get absorbed into their culture and you become one of them. It doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't polite or are less inferior to kannadigas. That is how they live and they are proud of their roots.You can go to bangalore , and you can live there and you don't have to learn a single word of kannada. They infact don't want you to learn kannada. They are too ashamed to teach you the language.They don't have any good latest kannada movies to take you and the music sucks as well. And finally , Kannadigas think all of this is because it is the outsiders fault. It is mostly a tamilian's fault for every issue they face or a telgite's fault. But on the other hand , they love to take credit for everything that works. They honestly believe everything good about Bangalore was built by them and the outsiders had nothing to do with it and they are simply here to steal !"},{"instruction":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","output":"Supply lines in the US Army are very good, we are the masters of logistics that was probably our biggest strength in WWII.

Start by identifying the 3 biggest giveaways that identify you as a non-native. For example as an English native speaker learning Spanish I might concentrate on 1) lack of schwa 2) rolled ‚Äòrr‚Äô 3) silent h. Once your 3 biggest giveaways are to some extent corrected, then identify the next 3 giveaways and so on. At a later stage as your ear becomes more tuned in, then go back to previous giveaways and fine tune them more. Beyond individual words, English is a stress timed language. Stressed syllables essentially occur at regular intervals. And non-stressed syllables must be shortened (and can sometimes even be omitted) to keep the timing on the stress. This is unlike French or Spanish which are syllable timed languages. This is something too that an English native learning those languages has to adjust to. But getting the stress right will come with careful listening. And remember your ear is your best friend learning to speak another language correctly (or at least the best you can)."},{"instruction":"What is issuing authority in a passport?

We were concerned about a fire arm in possession of a man with suicidal thoughts so we informed the police with his address. The street does exist but the house number was too high.

Because‚Ä¶ The definitions in this questions are inaccurate. I agree fully with Luka Trkanjec that the whole Hungtintonian thing is nonsense. What is a Western country? Does it need to be in Europe or North America? (Yes I have rarely seen Brazil and Columbia described as ‚Äúwestern countries‚Äù.) How ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù must it be? Or worse, does it need to be white? (New Zealand is western but Japan is not.) Moreover, no matter whether these questions are answered, throwing all qualified countries into one basket and the much, much more various others into the other basket called ‚ÄúEastern countries‚Äù. This often leads people to ignoring the true factors of the problem and focus on the fictional Berlin Wall of East and West.These countries cannot be summarized in one as ‚Äúmodernized in technology‚Äù. They have different GDP per capita, HDI, structures of economy and industry‚Ä¶It‚Äôs not like having concepts of these somehow helps them succeed; it‚Äôs certain that only after some time and degree do things began to change. These concepts are not eastern. They are pre-modern. That is, not belonging to a fully industrialized society. They are more suitable for agricultural societies. Obedience to elders: the ultimate purpose of obedience is not obedience. It‚Äôs support. It‚Äôs part of a primitive welfare system based on families. The elders have to make sure they are fed after they lost their ability to work. So they use morals like filial piety and family honor to bind their offsprings. On the long term this is good for everybody because they have the motivation to produce necessary population and everyone lives longer. (Now it becomes a source of conflict in China. Many young people are not happy with elders interfering their life, while some of the elders consider this a sign of ‚Äúmoral corruption of modern times‚Äù.Social conformity: IMO this is one of the most agricultural things ever because farming in ancient times needed intensive labour. A large population must live together in the same area. Reducing conflict would be necessary, and the most effective way was to tell everyone to stay the same, and punish those ‚Äúspecial‚Äù guys.Ancient tradition: things didn't change fast in those times. Experience of old times can be used later, such as the solar terms and ways of plough. Those who followed ancient traditions could accumulate more and prevail over those who ran around with almost nothing except for their children (hunter-gatherers).In some of these countries (China, India, Pakistan) vast countryside and rapid urbanization lead to the preservation of certain agricultural habits, while in some others like Japan the lasting pre-modern concepts have caused social problems like the stress of youths and violation of women‚Äôs rights. These concepts are not completely absent in ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù countries. I‚Äôm in Dresden right now and these are some of the photos I‚Äôve taken: (A masterpiece made of china, put together again after WWII.) (Only this wall is original. Others were torn down in WWII and were constructed again in the old styles in 1990s.) It is said in some countries like Poland and Germany, they prefer to repair the old buildings in the old styles.

Meanwhile, on a TV newscast (and on radio before that), the anchor is the person who hosts the broadcast. He or she reads the major stories, usually from the studio, and at times, tosses to a correspondent out in the field to report from the scene of a story. (Sometimes, the anchor too is out in the field, during a major crisis like the aftermath of a hurricane, for example, but usually the anchor works from the studio and the correspondents are at the scene.) Some anchors not only host and read the stories, but they go out and do some reporting too. However, that‚Äôs usually in the smaller markets. In the major markets (the biggest cities), the news anchor runs the broadcast, and works with his or her team of on-the-scene reporters. But if you are just talking about an announcer, that is often the person who reads commercials, or introduces a program, or does voice-over work (you see the video images, and hear someone‚Äôs voice narrating the story). An announcer may be trained in news, at which point, he or she will be reporting the stories. But every radio and TV station has both announcers and anchors. The difference is in their expertise and in the role the station needs them to play. Not every announcer handles news; they might announce any one of a number of different kinds of programs, or they might just read various types of announcements. But an anchor is generally associated with on-screen (and sometimes on-the-scene) news or sports coverage."},{"instruction":"Any recommendations for time management software (time tracking, estimates, invoices, purchase orders) for a creative agency?","output":"I suggest to try [LINKED_TEXT: Webwork] [URL: https://www.webwork-tracker.com/] as a time management software."},{"instruction":"Did the post office create zip codes?","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"Are online schools worth it?","output":"Metamorphosis Edu, an edu-tech platform announced the start of their 3rd edition of the Global Schoolpreneur Summit (GSS) 2020.

Is this borderline high?","output":"It‚Äôs not too high"},{"instruction":"Why do some iOS developers not use storyboards?","output":"Storyboards fail at runtime, not at compile time: You have a typo in a segue name or connected it wrong in your storyboard? It will blow up at runtime. You use a custom UIViewController subclass that doesn't exist anymore in your storyboard? It will blow up at runtime. If you do such things in code, you will catch them early on, during compile time. Storyboards get confusing fast: As your project grows, your storyboard gets increasingly more difficult to navigate. Also, if multiple view controllers have multiple segues to multiple other view controllers, your storyboard quickly starts to look like a bowl of spaghetti and you'll find yourself zooming in and out and scrolling all over the place to find the view controller you are looking for and to find out what segue points where. Storyboards make working in a team harder: Because you usually only have one huge storyboard file for your project, having multiple developers regularly making changes to that one file can be a headache: Changes need to be merged and conflicts resolved. When a conflict occurs, it is hard to tell how to resolve it: Xcode generates the storyboard XML file and it was not really designed with the goal in mind that a human would have to read, let alone edit it. Storyboards make code reviews hard or nearly impossible: Peer code reviews are a great thing to do on your team. However, when you make changes to a storyboard, it is almost impossible to review these changes with a different developer. All you can pull up is a diff of a huge XML file. Deciphering what really changed and if those changes are correct or if they broke something is really hard. Storyboards hinder code reuse: In my iOS projects, I usually create a class that contains all the colors and fonts and margins and insets that I use throughout the app to give it a consistent look and feel: It's a one line change if I have to adjust any of those values for the whole app. If you set such values in the storyboard, you duplicate them and will need to find every single occurrence when you want to change them. Chances are high that you miss one, because there's no search and replace in storyboards. Storyboards require constant context switches: I find myself working and navigating much faster in code than in storyboards. When your app uses storyboards, you constantly switch your context: \\"Oh, I want a tap on this table view cell to load a different view controller. I now have to open up the storyboard, find the right view controller, create a new segue to the other view controller (that I also have to find), give the segue a name, remember that name (I can't use constants or variables in storyboards), switch back to code and hope I don't mistype the name of that segue for my prepareForSegue method. How I wish I could just type those 3 lines of code right here where I am!\\" No, it's not fun. Switching between code and storyboard (and between keyboard and mouse) gets old fast and slows you down. Storyboards are hard to refactor: When you refactor your code, you have to make sure it still matches what your storyboard expects. When you move things around in your storyboard, you will only find out at runtime if it still works with your code. It feels to me as if I have to keep two worlds in sync. It feels brittle and discourages change in my humble opinion. Storyboards are less flexible: In code, you can basically do anything you want! With storyboards you are limited to a subset of what you can do in code. Especially when you want to do some advanced things with animations and transitions you will find yourself \\"fighting the storyboard\\" to get it to work. Storyboards don't let you change the type of special view controllers: You want to change a UITableViewController into a UICollectionViewController? Or into a plain UIViewController? Not possible in a Storyboard. You have to delete the old view controller and create a new one and re-connect all the segues. It's much easier to do such a change in code. Storyboards add two extra liabilities to your project: (1) The Storyboard Editor tool that generates the storyboard XML and (2) the runtime component that parses the XML and creates UI and controller objects from it. Both parts can have bugs that you can't fix. Storyboards don't allow you to add a subview to a UIImageView: Who knows why. Storyboards don't allow you to enable Auto Layout for individual View(-Controller)s: By checking/unchecking the Auto Layout option in a Storyboard, the change is applied to ALL controllers in the Storyboard. Storyboards have a higher risk of breaking backwards compatibility: Xcode sometimes changes the Storyboard file format and doesn't guarantee in any way that you will be able to open Storyboard files that you create today a few years or even months from now. Some of these reasons also apply to XIBs."},{"instruction":"Why did Dr B.R. Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","output":"He never was against Hinduism. That's pseudo communist propaganda.

I was with my friends coming back from Smoky mountains and I was pulled over doing 95 in a 65 zone. I pulled the moment cop turned on the lights. He asked me if I know how fast I was going. I said no. He said ‚Äú95‚Äù (think southern accent). He looked at my license which was still from Chicago. He came back with a ticket and said at 95 MPH I have to come back to the court so he has lowered the speed to say 90 mph. This enabled me to simply pay the ticket. 138 was the fine. My four friends decided that we split although I said I am responsible and I should pay. They said, since I was driving most of the time, I was the likely one to get it as they were also speeding.

The first step we can take to revive and generate employment, increase demand and consumption is to reduce the gst rates in automobile sector. Reducing the gst will have a tremendous impact on industries as most of the employment is generated through these industries as the other industries too for supply of additional parts. The automobile industry was already in crisis and pandemic made the situation more worse due to which so many productions are stopped and others had to cut down the production. It‚Äôs true that this will heavily impact the government tax collection but for the economy and in terms of long term this will be proved as the best step take by the govt. to revive the economy through the worst hit sector of the economy and in my opinion this alone is the best sector that will play a major role in generating jobs heavily and generating demands and as in terms of indirect effects this will also attract the foreign automobiles companies to invest in India that will again help as monetary benefit to economy as well as again large number of jobs will be created."},{"instruction":"Which is the best UberEATS clone in 2020?","output":"Hello..!

It is very simple what goes around comes around. Does it happen to everyone I do not know but it happened to me and here is my story. Twenty two years ago I got a job in SoCal. This job was good but did not pay much and I just wanted to get the hell out from a small town in Mississippi. Since I was not making much money I found a small affordable apartment near my job. Besides paying for apartment I had to support my girlfriend who was a student at the time. Our apartment was really old and dingy. It was right next to a liquor store with some drunks and crazies hanging day and night around the place. So every night after work and we would go to the beach and watch sunsets. About a month later we were near the beach and spotted a dog. It was a fully grown large female pit bull. We called her and she came to us. Very friendly she seems to be lost and tired. Her stomach was pretty big and I assumed she had parasites. We asked around and later own put an announcement in a paper but no one claimed her. We took her home. Got her fixed and dewormed. Vet who performed the surgery said that she didn‚Äôt have worms but was pregnant with nine poppies and within few weeks we would have 10 dogs instead of one. Since we lived in apartment we had to hide her and would take her out before and after the sunset so our neighbors would not see the dog. It lasted for a month and then we got a notice by mail - get rid of this dog or leave in 30 days. We decided to buy our own place because we did not want this dog to be back on the streets. I borrowed on all my credit cards and purchased a cheapest condo in the best neighborhood near my work I could find. At that time SoCal was still recovering from recession of the early nineties and real estate was very affordable. However, I never owned anything prior this purchase and the whole experience was terrifying for me. Soon we noticed that real estate prices were going up pretty fast and we bought another one borrowing against an existing property and another one. Soon we had few rentals which we sold later to buy a house by the beach where we found the dog. If it would not be for this dog we still would be leaving in terrible apartment near my work."},{"instruction":"w powerful are the Power Rangers? How do they compare to characters from Marvel or DC?

Snide was stated to have destroyed countless galaxies and even a freaking zord was needed to take him down."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"One thing that even many electronics engineers might not believe is that \\"There is nothing called over-charging in a smartphone\\". Yes, you read right, over-charging simply does not happen in smartphones of this decade. It is a sheer ignorance and stupidity that I have seen in even many technicians employed at service centers of Samsung, Sony, etc. who keep saying \\"Do not overcharge\\" or \\"do not keep it plugged your smartphone for charging overnight\\"!! Once upon a time technology was so not advanced smartphone manufacturers had to use a voltage supply to charge the battery. They had some voltage measurements via ADC to show battery level and that's it. This would often give wrong readings because voltage of a Li-Ion battery does not convey it's charge storage accurately. Li-Ion battery has following characteristics If it is completely charged it has a voltage of 4.2 VIf it is completely discharged it has a voltage of 3.7 V Just keep in mind that the converse of above statements is false, if battery is 4.2 V does not mean it is completely full or 3.7 V does not mean completely empty. Hence you see, estimating battery life with just voltage is not accurate and in older devices this would often be the reason for battery getting dead due to \\"overcharging\\". Nowadays the manufacturers use \\"charge controller\\" chips that are intelligent enough to estimate the accurate battery life and are programmed with the actual charge pattern of Li-Ion batteries. Once the battery is completely charged the charge controller just shuts down any supply to the battery and only powers your smartphone. So when your device is plugged in and charge is full don't worry, the charge controller chip will just cut off the supply to the battery and will keep powering your smartphone. When it is charging the charge controller chip will power your smartphone and your battery simultaneously (battery will thus charge). If you do have issues with overnight charging then it is due to a bad charger that is giving large voltage spikes to the smartphone, this can potentially damage other components as well and not just the battery. So if you have your original smartphone charger or any other high quality charger just relax and don't care about overnight charging. PS : I practice what I preach, I have been keeping my phone charging overnight probably at times for more than 12 Hrs plugged in continuously and it is still as great as a horse. EDIT 21/09/2015, 22:30 IST:How the charger might affect battery?Bad and poor quality chargers produce high voltage spikes that damage the charge controller and hence the battery is affected. So always use good quality chargers if you want to keep your device pluggedd in forever EDIT 22/09/2015, 13:45 IST:Do look at the comments, most of the common questions/doubts are there with clear explanations in the comments section. EDIT 26/10/2015 12:45 IST:A caution for all reading this : Never use a bad/cheap charger, never overload phone while charging."},{"instruction":"Can a Tomahawk missile hit a tank?","output":"From Block IV on, all day, every day.

Too much insulin can also put you into a kind of potentially lethal shock. Insulin is the fat conservation fat creation hormone. Insulin also instructs the kidneys to retain sodium. By keeping you carb intake low, you can keep your insulin low and the kidneys dump sodium so the blood pressure normalizes. Too little insulin and you have also too much glucose on the blood and need to take supplemental insulin. This is the case when the pancreas fails and the person become Type 1 diabetes.

Learning to code is a skill, and you can compare it to doing sports. If you want to be good at it and perform well at work, you should practice a lot. Try to practice coding daily, during your lunch break or after work. Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms ‚àíSearch ‚àí Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.Sort ‚àí Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.Insert ‚àí Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.Update ‚àí Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.Delete ‚àí Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure. Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space required by the algorithm in its life cycle. The space required by an algorithm is equal to the sum of the following two components ‚àíA fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables, that are independent of the size of the problem. For example, simple variables and constants used, program size, etc.A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size depends on the size of the problem. For example, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, etc. Space complexity S(P) of any algorithm P is S(P) = C + SP(I), where C is the fixed part and S(I) is the variable part of the algorithm, which depends on instance characteristicTime ComplexityTime complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the algorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step consumes constant time.For example, addition of two n-bit integers takes n steps. Consequently, the total computational time is T(n) = c ‚àó n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. Here, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases.Data Structures (DS) tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Data Structure.

Of course! Their testosterone level is higher than women. Women can build muscle irrespective of the above, by progressively overloading ( adding more weights reps or sets) and fueling their bodies with protein! Anyone ( men or women) can stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) by overloading the muscle! Mechanical tension! When you stimulate the muscle enough by strength training. The next thing you have to do is, feed it with protein! Then, here comes the main ingredient! Recovery & stress management. These two plays a vital role in gains. Top of all, some women can gain more than others. It depends on genetics too. Oh yeah! That's me. Ah! It took me a year or so to get to where I am today.

As I started giving my order to the waiter, that outspoken guest reminded me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget my special!‚Äù in a voice that everyone could hear. Nonetheless, I forgot all about that when paying the bill: I computed my usual 23-percent tip and rounded it up to a convenient-looking amount ‚Äî I think it came out to around 26-percent after the round-off. While we were on the way home, I remembered that special order and thought to myself, ‚ÄúOh my Gosh, I should have tipped more for that complicated request. Wish I‚Äôd given more like 40-percent.‚Äù Boy, did I feel embarrassed! Although I haven‚Äôt tipped large percentages at restaurants, I have done so at coffee shops. At one coffee shop where I go often, I typically get a small cup of coffee for 1.95, give the cashier a five, and get three one-dollar bills and a nickel in change. So, in order to leave at least my usual 23-percent tip, I put a dollar bill into the tip jar. Percentage-wise, this looks like a big tip ‚Äî more than 50-percent. But it‚Äôs really very small, and besides, the cashier deserves a big tip, since he probably works much harder to give me a 1.95 cup of coffee than he would if he were to give me a 15.00 breakfast consisting of cereal, scrambled eggs, and sausages. Why? Because, to serve coffee to people, he has to wash the coffee percolator out between every refill, wait for the coffee to perk, and handle very HOT cups of coffee. To serve big expensive meals, he would not have to touch anything hot! So a cup of coffee really deserves a much bigger tip than a full meal!"},{"instruction":"Did Josef Mengele have a good side?","output":"Actually, as I understand, he was a genius - a real Lex Luther - give the devil his due.

But we'll just have to wait and see. There are still strengths in the economy buy may be not enough to overcome serious blunders. The world works on multiple problems all the time in ways big and small even when it seems hopeless. And almost all of our problems are based on culture, on what goes on in our heads. Before the advent of homo sapiens DNA was the primary storehouse of knowledge. Once we started using symbols to transmit knowledge, that storehouse began to shift to human culture which now has an astounding impact on the planet and it's habitats and species and continues to increase it's power over our world. As you will soon learn I am a pessimist when it comes to our culture. In economics, size matters. That's why China and India have an economic potential that dwarfs the USA. Their potential internal markets are huge. All they need to do is involve more and more of their populations in the benefits of capital formation to easily move into the number one and number two economies in the world. But that is easier said than done because each country has it's own unique culture that determines it's economic policies even though all nations work within the western credit based rules of economic engagement. And for the most part our cultures are relatively ignorant of economic matters as Trump's election in the USA clearly proves. In economics, culture matters. Brexit is due to cultural values that are very similar to those in the USA. Trump got elected in the USA because a large segment of the voting public openly embraces our culture in this country that is racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, religiously bigoted, violence prone, wealth worshiping, neocolonial fascist, and anti-intellectual. And these values make clear thinking, intelligent economic decisions, and sound economic policy virtually impossible. The sad part is that a good share of the rest of the voting public (primarily white voters) also embraces those values but wants to cover up that embrace by pretending to disparage those who openly embrace them. But one thing you have to give Trump credit for is being a master politician. Anyone who can undermine the economic well-being of large numbers of people and still get them to vote for you is a master politician. There is an interesting small economic movement called Modern Monetary Theory that claims the value of money is based on the power to tax and that since the national debt is basically money we owe ourselves our governments can ignore it and spend as much as it wants as long as inflation is not a problem in which case the excess money can just be taxed out of the economy or removed via bond sales. I personally agree that you must restrict the amount of money in your economy (control inflation) based on the amount of goods and services your economy produces but I don't agree that taxes are necessary. And I think the reason money has the economic ability to generate goods and services is not because of taxation or because of those goods and services but because of the trust that each individual in the economy brings to the economic activity of the economy. Money is actually just trust. And we all bring the same equal amount of trust to that economic activity. Unfortunately we don't make the benefits of that trust (equal opportunity) available to everyone. There is a great add for SNHU that says, \\"talent is distributed to everyone evenly but opportunity is not\\". This is so true and our adherence to the credit based rules of economic engagement is one of the primary reasons. Capital formation (economic growth, wealth creation) requires entrepreneurship, raw materials, capital equipment, labor, market demand, production space, service space, accurate accounting, and money which in our system is provided primarily by our banking system as credit. Our credit based rules of economic engagement to which we all adhere are hierarchical and guarantee poverty, homelessness, income inequality, and a distorted economic playing field that overwhelmingly favors the wealthy and concentrates wealth excluding large segments of the population from participation in the allocation of economic resources that create wealth. But it is still the best piece of crap around. Credit (fiat money) is primarily available to the wealthy for creating wealth. The rest of us are only allowed enough credit to keep us in debt. What programs like Medicare and Social Security attempt to accomplish is a more broadly equitable distribution of economic resources and a housing program that addresses the issue of unaffordable rents would be a good addition. But the only way to really change that concentration of wealth which limits the development of our economy to the limited imaginations of the wealthy is to create rules that tend to generate a level economic playing field that gives everyone economic power not just the wealthy. Opening capital markets and freeing money creation from credit instrument requirements is one part of that change. The other part which is just as necessary is making a realistic way out of poverty by paying people who are upgrading their skill sets or getting education in general. Unfortunately as a voting public we do not seem to want to do that even though we claim to be democratic. Perhaps the tyranny of the majority which is responsible for our economic situation will actually doom democracy to the dust bin of history proving Plato right that the best form of government is a benevolent dictatorship. Obviously the Greeks were not able to make it work. And our attempts seem to inevitably produce leaders like Nixon, Trump, Orban, Erdogan, Putin, Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco.

No. The Karman line is the point in the atmosphere where it becomes nearly impossible to fly aerodynamically, and you have to use rocket power or some other space technology to keep flying above that point. That‚Äôs where ‚Äúspace begins.‚Äù What does that have to do with the center of the Earth? Who ever said the Earth has to be either the same thickness as the atmosphere or greater? Why can‚Äôt it be smaller? It‚Äôs a LOT thicker, by the way, but that‚Äôs not relevant. The two things aren‚Äôt related at all. You could have a tiny massive planet with a huge atmosphere, or you could have a larger, much less massive planet with almost no atmosphere at all. MASS is a much more important factor over size. The Karman line is a (somewhat) arbitrary line calculated to be where aircraft can‚Äôt possibly function anymore, and only spacecraft can. It‚Äôs basically where absolute air pressure reaches nearly zero, for all practical purposes. In fact, most aircraft can‚Äôt even get CLOSE to that altitude. Most of them stop gaining altitude around 12‚Äì15 miles above mean sea level. The absolute record for jet aircraft flight is about 23 miles altitude. The highest a weather balloon has been is only about 33 miles. The Earth is roughly 8000 miles across. So it‚Äôs roughly 4000 miles to the center.

How would they be governed, what would the life look like in each, and what would be their culture?","output":"Planet Internet. A massive continent sprawls over the deep and vast Data ocean, many islands branching out to form a massive web of land. Futuristic ships roar through the sky, a pristine sun setting in the west and a shattered, ringed moon rising in the eastern twilight. The Web, the fjorded mainland of the planet, is home to many stark nations with highly diverse communities. The heart of the web, a dense metropolitan hub glowing brightly from the view of space is a highly politicized mesh of territories claimed by many nations. Reddit. One of the largest nations in the Web, Reddit has the largest claim on the heart of the continent, and rightfully so. It is a hub of fashion, culture, politics, and urbanization. The massive land of Reddit is divided into thousands of provinces, known locally as subs. Around sixty main subs own the vast majority of Reddit‚Äôs land. Anyone can make a sub, but claiming a large amount of space is extremely difficult and expensive. The largest sub is Funny, a populated but weak sub that is very behind on the trends of the rest of Reddit. Memes is an oligarchic sub that is almost as large but holds much more influence than any other faction on the rest of the internet. These provinces fall into a loose federation, declaring war and alliances on one another but still following national law. Facebook. The Federative Republic of Facebook is a gigantic, corrupt, and intricately faked democracy. President Zuckerberg runs a high tech, sophisticated, automated spynet that catalogs and monitors anything said within its borders. Although larger than Reddit, it is further off center, being much older and having lost land to newer nations. Facebook has been under much scrutiny and question by Internet Federation law, but the President uses his extreme wealth and a series of political loopholes to keep his empire. Twitter. The democratic state of Twitter is a metaphorical battlefield of parties representing factions all over the Internet. It is lawless and structured at the same time, with soaring skyscrapers of trade and industry above a lawless underworld. Twitter shares borders with many many nations, possessing a large, spread out land claim. Robot overlords maintain some degree of justice but many degenerate activities still take place in the slums. Instagram. The Republic of Instagram is a monotonous, sprawling suburb. While the class of certain areas vary, all are similar and very little unique things happen within it‚Äôs borders. Instagram is made of tightly knit neighborhoods that have occasional alliances but remain mostly autonomous. 4chan. If Twitter is archaic, the 4Chan DMZ is an all out anarchy. Based in the shattered mountains, a range of destroyed hills that once served as a nuclear test zone, 4Chan is an unclaimed lawless wasteland. Many parts of the Chan are uninhabitable without special training and protection, making a perfect setting for shady activity. Clans known as boards hold a contested balance of power, some having somewhat disciplined capitals while others are no more than claimed swaths of wasteland. Many illigal activities occur in 4chan‚Äôs depths, with many flocking from far and wide to take part in black market deals. 4chan is said to have a gateway to the infamous Dark Web, the subterranean unstable labyrinth beneath planet Internet‚Äôs surface. Some explorers boast tales of underground copies of 4chan and Reddit, made by crime lords directly under the official land zones. The Dark Web serves as a playground in which galactic-scale crimes rampage while staying ahead of Galactic Federation spies. Quora. The Republic of Quora is a small but well-known hub of science and learning. The people of Quora form a coalition of knowledge, answering the queries of anyone who requests them. It‚Äôs moderately sized borders are bristling with skyscrapers and research buildings. The slums do not go deep, with cheaply constructed but still clean and intact 3D printed houses lining the outer edges. Any illegal or abusive activity is prohibited by an order overzealous robots. Buzzfeed. The free state of buzzfeed is a corporate nightmare. It‚Äôs political integrity barely stands and many scams run by the state or private entities plague it‚Äôs jumbled streets. Buzzfeed is a sleazy, populated melting pot of mismatched buildings and grimy abandoned foundries. Scams, civilians, hackers, and companies all exist in BuzzFeed, with an extremely corrupt government overseeing it all. Youtube. The Soviet Federation is Youtube is a media hub crammed with both urban metropolises and abandoned pits of low-effort content. Susan, the Overlord of Youtube, does not care for Youtube‚Äôs creators despite them making huge profits for her. Poorly programmed robot enforcers patrol the cities and towns of Youtube, attacking and abusing creators. Google. The trans-gov corporation of Google is an intergalactic conglomerate, owning several colonies and essentially claiming and selling land from the Web to many starting companies. Google provides best-in-class transport around the Web, using high-speed hypertrains and orbital shuttles to dominate the industry. It owns many factories and laboratories all over the Web, it‚Äôs holdings dotted everywhere. Steam. The Republic of Steam is a massive country covered in colossal factories. Steam creates and sells buildings on a huge scale, being a long standing industrial empire of independent corporations which pay considerable tariffs to Steam, making the council of Valve, steam‚Äôs leaders, very rich."},{"instruction":"w possible is it for a US Army from Afghanistan to send money through a United Nation courier delivery company?","output":"The US doesn‚Äôt have soldiers in Afghanistan.

Spot reduction of fat is not possible to accomplish with diet alone. Eat fewer calories throughout the day, so that your body will use up fat as stored energy. If you do that, you will lose weight in the face too. Luckily, if you want a slimmer face, your body goes after the fat first in the neck, jaw and face. So if you cut down on calories but do it in a healthy manner, you should have a less full face in no time. You need to create a caloric deficit. It takes about 3,500 calories burned to lose a single pound. You will burn some calories every day just by living and breathing. You need to burn more than you take in to lose weight. Effective weight loss occurs gradually. Cutting calories in a healthy manner means eliminating some calories ‚Äì say 500 a day, through diet or exercise ‚Äì without completely depriving your body of food. Instead, make healthier food choices or start slow, say by eliminating that morning doughnut from your diet. Not eating at all is medically unsafe. It also could put your body in starvation mode, which will actually reduce your metabolism and make it harder to lose weight. 2. Drink a lot of water to keep the body fully hydrated. There are many reasons that it‚Äôs a good idea to drink a lot of water throughout the day, but one of them is that it will reduce bloating in your face. The reason water helps reduce face fat is because it flushes toxins out of your body. Thus, it also increases your overall health. It will also improve the look of your skin and hair. Drinking cold water will burn extra calories. Drinking 64 ounces of water per day is a good target to strive for. Keeping the body constantly hydrated will make you feel better, and it should make your face look more slender over time. 3. Eat the right foods for a healthier diet. A diet that is low in processed foods and refined flour (like white bread and pasta) will be healthier for you. Instead, try to eat a lot of fresh vegetables and fruits, foods with fiber, fish, and other protein rich foods. Try not to eat food with a lot of salt (avoid junk food as it‚Äôs loaded with salt). Salt encourages your body to retain more water, so it will bloat your face. Sugar is also linked to a fatter face. Processed carbs with a lot of sugar in them are going to cause face bloat. Although people who are underage should not drink alcohol, another negative side effect of alcohol is that it causes the face to bloat by dehydrating the body. Some good food choices include almonds, broccoli, spinach, and salmon. 4. Determine whether you have food intolerance. Sometimes food allergies or intolerance are to blame for a fuller face. See a doctor if you think you might have one. As an example, some people have sensitivity to gluten and would benefit from eating gluten-free foods. Many restaurants and grocery stores are including gluten-free options these days. Some people with irritable bowel syndrome sometimes think their faces are fuller as a result. Gastrointestinal disorders are fairly common, affecting about 15 percent of adults. It‚Äôs also possible that hormones are causing your face to look fuller, such as PMS (or in older women, peri-menopause). Part 2 of 3:Trying Exercises and Tricks to Slim the Face1. Try toning your face with facial exercises. You can exercise your face to make it look slimmer. This works by strengthening facial muscles, reducing saggy skin in the face. Try the cheek puff exercise. Simply take a deep breath and hold the air in your cheeks. Then push it to the other cheek. Do this several times throughout the day. A smile exercise that tightens the cheeks and mouth is to smile and clench your teeth for a few seconds. Don‚Äôt squint your eyes. Then pucker your lips. Repeat. Do this on one side, and then switch sides. Pucker your lips for five seconds. Hold the pucker on the right, then switch to the left side of your face. If you have an expressive face and use your facial muscles a lot ‚Äì even just by smiling and laughing a lot ‚Äì your face will look more slender. 2. Increase your metabolism by exercising the body. If you do so, you will also see changes to your face. Exercise is also good for your health overall. This might mean just walking for 30 minutes most days a week. Or you could try a circuit training program 3-5 days a week. Any exercise is going to help boost your metabolism, reduce overall fat, and slim your face. Make sure that you don‚Äôt make the mistake of thinking you can eat junk food because exercise will take care of it. Losing weight is mostly diet, although exercise will definitely strengthen the body and improve health. 3. Get a lot of sleep to see a more slender face. The body needs sleep to be healthy. There are many studies that correlate lack of sleep with weight gain. A fatigued body may bloat and also cause the facial muscles to sag. This can make the face look larger than normal. A good rule of thumb is to try to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Try to have a regular sleeping schedule. 4. Try creative options for slimming the face. From blowing balloons to hot towel treatments, there are many ideas out there that are said to slim the face. Blowing balloons will tone your cheeks because it exercises the muscles in them. Just blow a balloon and release the air in it, and do this 10 times. You should notice a difference in 5 days. Try putting hot towels on your face because some believe steam can help you reduce cheek fat. The face will sweat and release some fat stored in your face. Just put the towel into warm water, and then apply it to your face. Some think steam can help slim your face by removing toxins from it. Chew sugar-free gum for at least 20 minutes twice a day. This actually works as a facial exercise that will cut calories and tone your face. You could also try a facial massage using ginseng or wheat germ oil to stimulate blood circulation in the face. Start at your chin, moving upwards in a circular motion with your palms. Part 3 of 3:Using Beauty Tips to Get a Slimmer Face1. Use makeup to make the face have a slimmer appearance. There are different makeup tricks you can use to create the illusion of a slimmer face. Apply a bronzing powder in the hollows of your cheeks or on the sides of your nose. Adding blush to the tops of your cheeks also can make the face look less full. With the powder, draw a line along your cheekbones, blending the powder in from your ear to the corner of your mouth. Just above it, apply blush. Choose a bronzer that is two shades darker than your skin tone. This way you can use it to add more shape to your face, making it appear slimmer. 2. Emphasize the eyes. If you use makeup to put more emphasis on your eyes, your face is likely going to look slimmer. When your lips are full, it can make your face look rounder. So if you're worried about that, play up your eyes. Put mascara, eyeliner, and eye shadow on them, and leave your lips plain or only put a plain gloss on them. The shape of the eyebrows is really important to making your face look slim. If your eyebrows are higher and more shaped, this can make your overall face look thinner. Many beauty salons will wax and shape your eyebrows for you if you're not sure how to do it right. 3. Master the art of contouring. Many Hollywood stars use contouring to alter the shape of their faces, such as creating stronger cheekbones or slimmer noses. To slim the nose, take a darker powder than your skin tone, and apply a thin line of it on each side of your nose. Then, use a brush to blend it along each edge. Use a highlighter to apply it above the eyebrows, and draw a line with it down the center of your nose. Blend it into your skin with a brush. To contour the face, take a contouring powder, also darker than your skin tone, and draw it on your cheeks, angling down your cheeks. Smudge it in so it doesn't look like a harsh line. Use powder that is two shades darker than your skin. Contouring allows you to alter the shape and lines of your face. 4. Illuminate your face. Another trick that you can use with makeup to slenderize the face is to add an element of illumination to it. Take sheer highlighting powder. Using a makeup brush, put it under your eyes, and down the middle of your nose. You should use the illumination technique in conjunction with bronzing powder or contouring. Some believe it will make your face look slimmer because of the contrast with the bronzing powder. 5. Choose the hairstyle that makes your face look most slender. Not all hairstyles are created equal. Depending on your face shape, a hairstyle can make your face look rounder or slimmer. If your hair is long, don‚Äôt grow it past your chest, and have a hairstylist create some soft layers to frame your face. You want to create some curves in the hair around the face by the cheekbones and eyes, avoiding straight lines in the hair. Bangs will probably make your face look fuller if they are cut straight across. You should avoid blunt cut bobs and instead go for a longer shaggier look with layers. Pulling the hair straight back will make your face look rounder by showcasing your temple. A high vertical bun gives the illusion of a slimmer and longer face. 6. Resist the urge to explore cosmetic surgeries. These can go so wrong, and they may look unnatural. However, it‚Äôs obvious that older people sometimes explore them to get rid of fat in the face. Fat suctioning procedures or face lifts can remove excess fat or skin. Some people opt for cheek implants to give the face a different appearance. If you're worried about fat under your chin, non-invasive procedures like cryolipolysis (\\"fat freezing\\") or injections that will break down the fatty tissue in that area. Think long and hard before exploring any of these options. Be happy with your natural looks. Find comfort in your own skin. There are many stories of people who undergo cosmetic surgeries they live to regret. Underage people should try natural ways of slimming the face instead, such as using makeup tricks or, better yet, a healthier diet. Cosmetic surgeries can be dangerous and expensive."},{"instruction":"Which is the best UberEATS clone in 2020?","output":"Easy maintenance and a well-designed UberEats clone script by Trioangle to manage every module in the food delivering business.

But, just asking this question tells me that you are either inexperienced with edibles or you are just throwing this question out there to see how people will answer it. I consider 20‚Äì30mg to be a great high for those who are at least experienced with cannabis products. If you have never used any cannabis products at all, you may want to start with a smaller dose‚Ä¶ say 5‚Äì15mg. Unless you want to totally get spaced your first time. If it is your first time and you just have your mind set on 25mg, just be ready to feel really weird! This will be an experience you will not forget‚Ä¶ but you will survive it. I‚Äôve actually been knocked to my knees the first time I tried smoking concentrates.

Gave it a few minutes‚Ä¶ then said ‚ÄúWOAH!‚Äù I had never gotten that high from a cannabis product before. Not even when I ate 120mg of edible. I generally take anywhere from 30‚Äì60mg of edible for a really nice high, depending on how much weed I‚Äôve been smoking lately. Tolerance plays a huge role here.

Now a new S8 in india sells around for Rs.37000 and OP6 for Rs.35000. If gaming is the highest priority then go with OP6.It also has support for true dual 4g volte which will be missing in s8.If you want a better UI go with OP6. If you want better (battery+charger) life go with OP6. Speaker quality is more are less same in both devices. I would say the camera would also be comparable in both phones atleast as far as still shots are concerned.Both are made of glass. Now s8 has the far better display. It has IP68 rating. Better 3.5 mm 32 bit dac. It has samsung pay which is actually useful. It has wireless charging. The processor is still good. It will have better customer support. If consuming media is the highest priority go with s8. If you are asking between S9 and OP6, i would say hands down OP6 simply beacause of price. Investing that much money into a phone doesnt make any sense to me. Most of the time you will be consuming video content,take calls and click SOME photos. You could game pretty well even in a mid range phone. But I would say if you are planning to use the phone for 3 years or so, go with OP6 as they deliver prompt updates and they age well.

Among them, coir based mattresses are fabricated using the fibers from outer husk of a coconut. Due to their organic nature, they are very well suited for the people who are allergic to synthetic substances. The greatest advantage of such mattresses is that they are very well ventilated and thus provide enhanced hygroscopic properties, i.e., they impart great air circulation and moisture absorption characteristics. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user‚Äôs body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. On the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses. While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‚Äòbouncy‚Äô than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for. I gained in-depth knowledge about them from the post - [LINKED_TEXT: Vibhor Shergill's answer to The extensive guide to purchasing a new Mattress.] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] So, today, i.e., 1st November, 2021, at 2:57 PM, I placed the order for my mattress, keeping the insights gained in consideration.

People started asked him how come you have only three arrows ‚Ä¶ He replied with one arrow I can kill all the Kauravas , with one arrow i can kill all the Pandavas . So there is more than enough for me‚Ä¶ When krishna heard this boast and said Okay show us what kind of skills you have and he showed him a banyan tree with thousands and thousands of leaves. He said let me see with a single arrow how many leaves you can pierce. Barbarik used a single arrow with necessary empowerment and with single arrow he pierced every leaf on the tree and the arrow came and around Krishna's feat which was over a fallen leave waiting to pierce ‚Ä¶looking at this Krishna said that's very impressive , So, whose side will you fight bc no body have seen him before ,he's come from the south. Barbarik replied I will always fight on the losing side. Day by day I will see, if kauravas are losing I will fight for them , If pandavas are losing I will fight for them. Any time when I see one particular army is losing I will fight for them. Now Krishna looked at the situation. If this guy is on other side you should not win , that will be the formula. because if you start winning , this guy will go on join the loosing army. Krishna said Can I ask you for something ? which will you give it to me ? I want you to remove the head of one warrior. Barbarik said for you I will do it , tell me who it is ? Krishna went into his camp brought out a mirror and showed it to him. Now Barbarik understood he‚Äôs done. He asked one request , Yes but I one request... I have come all the way from south to see this war. I want to see this one, such a great war a warrior like me, I don‚Äôt want to miss it . I want to see the spectacle of this war. Krishna said that's okay you remove your head I will make sure that you can see and speak. Barbaric took his sword and removed his own head held it by the hand and gave it to Krishna. Krishna said let us give him a much better vantage point and moved the head to the hill from there he can see the whole war. Now this head was watching the whole war. when Dronacharya was killed, After that Arjuna raging now because Karna is going to be the commander and he wants to kill him. All these days Krishna was kind of baby sitting Arjuna. Now he came out and said Arjuna you just know this , you are not the greatest archer. Any day with eyes closed Karna will be a better archer than you . Arjuna was shocked. Krishna You are saying this to me ? Krishna said Yes ! am telling you the truth.Today nor tomorrow you are going to battle with that man. You better know the truth. Fancy things you can believe from distance. When you come close up you better know it.Tomorrow you are going to battle them I want you to know hes the better archer than you any day.He has Indra's shakti with him and few other ayudas with him. If Indra had not taken that kavach , his armor and his kundal if these two things were not taken from him ...Please know this , He can you can kill you. He can defeat Indra him self and kill him..Why Indra he can defeat me and kill me!! I want you to know this even I could not take him in battle if he had his kavach and kundala‚Äôs. Do not believe you are superior to him. You are not superior to him. As long as he has shakti is in his hands he will kill you effortlessly . Arjuna kind of shattered. He's always walking around with his aura of being greatest warrior on the planet. He was completed disillusioned. Krishna you are saying this to me ? am not the greatest Archer ? Krishna said absolutely you are not the greatest archer !! After the war is over padavas soldiers who are few left they wanted to know in this battle who was the greatest warrior. who fought better than whom , they came and asked Krishna who was the best warrior in this battle of 18 days. Krishna laughed and said why don‚Äôt you go and ask Barbarik , he's been sitting there having the best view of the whole war. He's looking at the whole game absolutely without missing anything. I have been into so many situations I would have defiantly missed something, ask him he will know. So they went to Barbarik's head which was sitting there on the mountain , and they asked who is the greatest warrior ? who achieved the victory , which warrior was the determining factor ? After hearing this Barbarik said it was neither Arujna nor Karna nor Bhishma nor Dronacharya nor Ashvatthama nor Dhrishtadyumna nor Pandavas nor Kauravas who decided the course of this war. It was Vishnu in a deceptive form , It is the Sudarshana Chakra which won the war. It is the Sudarshana Chakra which caused the slaughter.

Musicals usually have catchier tunes that could be learned by the audience. The ranges of songs are usually lower with only a few extremely high notes. Opera, on the other hand, aims to push the ranges of the singers. Musicals are usually sung in the language of the lyricist, most are in English. Operas are almost ALWAYS in a European language other than English or in an Asian language for their style of opera. Musicals usually include more speaking than operas, and acting is a high priority, while in opera, casting directors will complete forgive bad acting if the singer is amazing."},{"instruction":"What are the best baby skin care products?","output":"Some of the [LINKED_TEXT: best baby skin care products available in Pakistan] [URL: https://www.reana.pk/brand/maybelline/] include Johnson's Baby Lotion, Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Moisturizing Cream, and Cetaphil Baby Daily Lotion.

But, when we talk of \\"big cats,\\" we usually mean the four biggest wild cats, which are lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars. These cats are classified as \\"big\\" cats since they can reach weights of 600 pounds and heights of more than 3 feet at the shoulder. While there are large dogs, none of them have reached the size and weight of these big cats. This is likely due to the differences in evolutionary history and adaptations between cats and dogs. Cats evolved as solitary predators and their large size is an adaptation for hunting and taking down prey. Dogs, on the other hand, evolved as social animals that hunted in packs and their size was not as critical to their hunting success. Humans have carefully developed dogs for a number of purposes, such as companionship, defense, and hunting. There are multiple dog breeds with various sizes, shapes, and temperaments as a result. Nonetheless, we have not deliberately developed dogs to be as huge as the biggest cats, most likely because there is no benefit or purpose in doing so.

Like Viktor Toth, I am interested in theory, and like him, I have had to earn a living some other way, and in fact, my financial income has largely been made with the view to give me the security that I can afford to spend my time doing what I want to do. Okay has nothing to do with this. And I don‚Äôt think hope has anything to do with it. Having said that, however, my approach to theory differs from some others. In my opinion, the firsts step in forming a theory is to formulate a premise, which states what you think is going on. The next step is to review the observational evidence and decide whether that is at least potentially in accord with your premise. (If it is not, discard the premise and start again.) It is only now that one starts to try to put mathematics to work. Now, the logical problem here is that we do not know what gravity is, or what originates it, and worse, there are no observations (that I know of) that require gravity to be quantised. That does not mean out is not, because gravity is so weak that it is difficult to see what such effects could be that would not be swamped by something else. Having said that, what does quantised mean? In my ebook, ‚ÄúGuidance Waves‚Äù I suggest the basic premise of quantum mechanics is that action is quantised. But is that statement proper? It might be that only action from electromagnetic interactions is quantised, in which case gravity will not be (unless somehow it can be unified with electromagnetism). Which gets to the next point: why do you think gravity should be quantised? What evidence requires it? So my answer to, what is the reason, is that there is no evidence that requires it, which means there is no guidance as to what such relationships should look like, or even if there are such relationships. People may argue to should be quantised, but unless such theory can make a prediction that is (a) observable, and (b) different from what could occur if it is not quantised, I do not believe that such an exercise will get anywhere meaningful. In this context, submitting mathematical papers that lead to no observable phenomena are not, in my opinion, meaningful."},{"instruction":"it ever too early to start a design history file ready ideation for a medical device? What about when the clinician first talks to the engineer?","output":"It‚Äôs never too early to start DHFRI. Huh? What is DHFRI? Let‚Äôs first start with some clarifications on what is a Design History File (DHF) for a medical device, versus Design Controls, versus Design History File Ready Ideation (DHFRI). Design Controls are part of a formal regulation (such as the FDA‚Äôs Quality System Regulation) and/or standard (such as ISO 13485). Established medical device companies will have a quality system in place and typically have a specific standard operating procedure (SOP) for Design Controls. DHF is a documentation process that captures key relationships, often called a Trace Matrix, of User Needs, Design Inputs, Design Outputs, Verification, and Validation. The DHF will also capture history of risk reduction and Human Factors Engineering formative and summative studies. There is most definitely a ‚Äútoo early‚Äù zone for Design Controls. One clear demarcation line is if you haven‚Äôt yet started a company. In this case, there‚Äôs no quality system and no SOP to be compliant to. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to draft an SOP and/or implement such a strict quality system prior to starting a company. However, it‚Äôs never too early to start capturing design history, aka, the building blocks for that Trace Matrix. Even at the earliest stages of a clinician and engineer talking together about potential problems; user needs are being captured for inspiration. But are they being used to build a foundation for future Design Controls? The pain of turning on Design Controls pales in comparison to the pain of building a trace matrix. Capturing unmet needs and then articulating them into well defined user needs can be a fun process when embraced throughout the design process. However, when trying to articulate needs that are going back in time, potentially years of design history past; that‚Äôs painful. And that‚Äôs just one column of the matrix.

Formulate a trading plan ‚Äì A plan will guide your actions and you will be able to avoid emotions while trading. In a plan you must mention the position size, the targets , triggers and stops. Determine entry and exit points ‚Äì Now this is one the best things to do. Following this rule will save you from placing wrong trades and being confused. You will know exactly when to take a position and when to get out of it as per the current market situations Choose less number of stocks - For beginners , trading too many stocks would not be a good idea. Pick up two or three stocks and analyze these carefully to see what moves when and why. Focus on a risk ‚Äì reward ratio ‚Äì As per your conditions, establish a risk reward ratio of say 3:1 .

Avoid penny stocks ‚Äì Trading with illiquid stock is not a good idea for day traders . Since you open and close positions in the same day, one should always and always choose stocks that are highly liquid. Time commitment ‚Äì As a day trader you may have to spend hours sitting in front of your PC to track the prices of stocks. So those who can not spare enough time should not consider day trading as an option for them. Avoid emotions ‚Äì As a day trader , there will be a swing of emotions you‚Äô ll experience in a day because you place a number of orders in a day.

If you don‚Äôt intend to become proficient with a handgun, the answer is‚Ä¶. none, stick with a shotgun. Since you specified home defense, I am going to go with the lowest priced guns I would recommend. I seriously doubt anyone wants to spend upwards of 1000 on something that will spend most of its life in the night stand drawer. Assuming you are committed to proficiency, you have two choices: revolver and semi-auto. Revolvers are a good choice for home defense because they don‚Äôt require a lot of maintenance, and are extremely simple to operate. The .38 Special caliber is usually considered the minimum defensive round. A better home defense load is the .38SPL+P loading. I would say shoot a few +P‚Äôs to get used to them, practice with standard .38SPL, and keep loaded for defense with .38SPL+P. I would recommend a 4‚Ä≥ barrel. It helps tame the recoil. A 2‚Ä≥ is adequate for home defense ranges, but is harder to control if a follow-up shot is needed. Revolvers only hold six rounds. If you think you will need more than six rounds, you might want to consider moving to a better neighborhood. A serviceable revolver can be had for less than 250 Rock Island Model M200 Taurus 85 Protector If you are a little more committed to regular cleaning and willing to spend a little time in regular practice, or if you want a gun suitable for target shooting, you might consider a semi-automatic. There are a few semi-autos I would recommend as a strictly home defense gun. Some of the less expensive, I would throw away if they were given to me. I would not recommend .380ACP, though some would. Purely for home defense, the Hi-Point line of guns are serviceable, but my best semi-auto recommendation is this: This is the SAR B6P Compact and sells for under 300. It is lightweight, very reliable, extremely accurate, a combat proven design, built by a military arms contractor. The grip is not so large that anyone would have difficulty with it, and felt recoil is lower than many semi-autos due to its excellent design. It would be hard to make a better recommendation."},{"instruction":"it worth buying a (new) Herman Miller Aeron chair?

In contrast my husband bought a chair last year for ¬£100. It‚Äôs about to go to the tip. The chair webbing has sagged so it‚Äôs no longer comfortable, the arms are worn and starting to peel. You can no longer operate the height control either. Some things are worth the investment. Buy cheap jeans, not cheap chairs."},{"instruction":"What happens when you get pulled over doing 100 mph?","output":"I enjoy hypothetical questions as much as the next guy, with that being said, many others like myself have lived this out in a real life scenario. As anticipated, your being stopped for a 100 mph driving ‚Äúoffense,‚Äù will not result in a trophy, award, or any other ‚Äúattaboy‚Äù respect points from the officer on scene. If all things unfold through cooler heads prevailing, the result of a citation without any further damage involving another vehicle or property, along with producing the standard 3 accoutrements always required to operate your vehicle, you are definitely getting cut some slack.

(Bust out the yes sir and yes maam, and put away that attitude, keep it short and quiet) you wanna go home or you wanna go to jail? Many of the instances involved are from a time in our teenage years, mine is no exception, so I'll give you the highlights. Between 96‚Ä≤‚Äì97‚Ä≤ roughly, Aurora, Colorado. One of my best friends broke his hand, his mama, girlfriend, drive his truck, our friend,my we'll call him John, solo in his car, myself and my best friends cousin Missy, opted to ride in my car. I'm 17yrs old, nobody is an adult but mom dukes and nobody younger than 15, its summer time school is out, the weather is great! All of us in a convoy head to the E.R. about 4 miles away, around 8pm, hours passed by we all managed without smartphones since no one had phones those days that weren't willing to pay a ransom for it. 25yrs ago the concept of the internet and things related were nothing resembling today, it is now 2:45am, with our good buddy sporting a brand new cast, we all get going back to where we started. This time we decided to take I-225 Northbound and at this hour not exactly rush hour, prior to major construction its 2 lanes each way plus the off ramp for each exit, its nothing like the monster today with 5 lanes per side and dedicated on/off ramps, but its no country road. Ol' John boy wants to race his new car, i abliged, I'm a mechanic and been learning from 10yrs old I have time and money in my Acura Integra, B18 non v-tec tons of wrench time nearly 100hp per cylinder, never heard of fast and furious, thank goodness. Waiting on the light in the double turn lane he's revving away, she's laughing at him since she knows it's already over. Boom! Green light, we turn i push down the ramp and never see him again, I made sure to insult injury and gave it some gusto! I only glance twice at the speedo crossing 110 and again before i noticed the police cruiserin the median under the one overpass without any ramps, the needle is between 145‚Äì160mph, the old gauge cluster tops at 145 but an upgrade from Japan gave me 190 at the peg, I'm still pushing and I know he's going to be mad if I stop, no way he catches me sitting a 0mph and now I'm on my way past 155-160, I pay no more attention to it since I blew past so I wasn't sure but I know what it sounded like, one of the greatest sounds I've ever heard, I considered running but with my passenger i thought twice and got off on the exit I would have anyway. At the bottom about to turn right, he emerges on the down hill ramp with almost catching air from the transition and used the entire 300ft to stop nearly hitting the light pole to my left so I rolled forward, it looked like needed the room, he did, I pull up the brake roll my window down and wait, not long though, he's beyond livid!it started with ‚Äúwhy the F*@k are you driving like that on ‚Äúmy\\" highway‚Äù and ended in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äùconsider yourself lucky! do you understand!‚Äù it was epic. He wrote me the most impressive ticket I've ever laid eyes on, 32‚Äì34 points total, 153mph in a 55mph zone, speed contest (drag racing) wreckless operation of a motor vehicle, and failure to obey reduced exit ramp speed. YIkes! I did jump off doin triple digits, but he did too, which was definitely a quick lesson in stopping distance vs available real-estate,. I said very little and he asked Missy a couple questions and he didn't enforce curfew since we're both under age, I think it dawned on him why I pulled over when I had such a monster lead, because when the day came he was there the judge went down the list and the court room was buzzing, being full probably every day, before I got yelled at and before I could speak , the officer spoke to the judge on the side for a few moments and suddenly everything was dropped from 2 1/2 licenses worth of points down to an 8 hour driving class and a 2 point defective vehicle, 153.00 fine. One dollar for every mph. I left shocked, I paid at the clerks window, took my 8 in change and went to tell the team a real head scratcher. At nearly 100mph over the speed limit, this was not even a contender for an outcome, it was my only speeding ticket in that car, but I'll remember it for life."},{"instruction":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

He was holding it against my right temple as he was telling me to drive and I couldn't find the keys to the car so I looked him straight in his eyes and told him that I couldn't magically make the fucking keys appear so he would just have to soot me or he could help me look for them. Then he took off running but dropped his drugs so I picked them up and went back to my car knowing that I now had the leverage. When he came back I told him to give me the 9, he gave it to me I unloaded it took it apart and threw it in the trunk. Then I told him he could either get in and behave or kick rocks. He chose to get in then I proceeded to drive over 1,000 miles to get him away from the fucking drugs that made him something I never want to see again. I helped him detox and told him if he ever touched them again I would walk away and never look back. He's been sober ever since. I HATE DRUGS!!!"},{"instruction":"What is dark matter?

So whenever I do some mistakes, I pray to Karma hit me back soon instead of multiplying it later. Recently we visited our native place with my family by hiring Zoomcar. My sister gave me Rs. 2000 note by saying she received from someone, which has some marks/paints (at backside) and no one takes it back. She requested me whether I can change it at the Petrol pump or somewhere. I thought to submit in the Bank once I back, but on the way, I filled fuel to the vehicle worth Rs. 1000 and handover the same Rs.2000 note. He returned the balance amount and I start the vehicle in a hurry.

Even if every skin cell had chloroplasts producing sugar, animals would need to consume food to fuel their high metabolic needs. Think about how long it takes a plant to produce a tomato. And, then consider how many tomatoes you would would have to eat each day every day to stay alive. You would require a whole field of tomato plants to fuel your activities. This is how heterotrophs thrive. They consume standing crop that takes far longer to grow than it takes to burn. Animal activities are far more explosive as a result.

It also provides ‚Äúmelt‚Äù as a synonym for ‚Äúthaw‚Äù, but does not provide synonyms for ‚Äúmelt‚Äù. In the sense you‚Äôre asking, probably the main difference is that ‚Äúmelt‚Äù implies a ‚Äúchange of state‚Äù ‚Ä¶ from solid to liquid. Water can melt from ice to liquid, but so can iron: from solid to liquid. ‚ÄúThaw‚Äù also implies ‚Äúgoing above freezing‚Äù, but an additional synonym is ‚Äúwarm‚Äù. You will never see someone describing the melting of iron as ‚Äúthawing‚Äù. ‚ÄúThaw‚Äù implies water as the only material undergoing change, whereas ‚Äúmelt‚Äù can apply to any material capable of existing in solid and liquid forms. So ‚Äúthaw‚Äù (in a physical sense) implies 32 F (0 C) as the notable temperature. Both words are applied to non-physical uses, too ‚Ä¶. ‚Äúshe melted in his arms‚Äù and ‚Äúrelationships thawed between the countries‚Äù ‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt work if the verbs were switched.

It‚Äôs prominent that a group of trio will end up splitting into two and will leave the third one devastated. Same happened with me , I was the third person their and trust me being a third person is really being in distress. The irony here , is you know how they treat you but still you stay hoping someday something will change but that doesn‚Äôt happen. Infact they treat you worse and you compromise. I know some people will surely relate this situation. Let me tell you a situation where they put me most of the times. Let‚Äôs call them A and B. Sometimes we fought over silly things which is very normal because not everyone will think the same as you do and hence it is very normal. After that silly fight A and B teamed up and they usually stopped talking to me. This is fine but they used tactics of showing that I am not important to them, taunting, rolling their eyes over me, whispering about me in front of me üòÇ damn I tolerated all that things. I am amazed by myself that I was treated as a third person and I took that very easily. Years later when B left the town for further studies and A was left alone, that phase was kind of okay because A was just left with me. Everything was normal and I thought she is my best friend for more than 3 years. But as it is said betrayal comes from person you never expected. It‚Äôs been more that for years that we haven‚Äôt talked properly. My sister always told me that she is jealous of you but I never thought a bit that this could be a reason and I still don‚Äôt know what had happened and what lead our relationship to come to and end.

Even while many marketers claim that affiliate marketing may be used in any niche, affiliate products can be used to modify any specialty. After assessing the marketplace, you may start by building a list of niches and then selecting the one that best meets your interests from the list. Selling Expensive Products Although it is clear that more expensive products result in more fees, you should assess if they will be able to compete with the conversion rate before purchasing expensive products. Keep in mind that, while more expensive products bring in more commissions, buyers are rare. Furthermore, consumers do not frequently acquire pricey items. Money Prioritization One of the difficulties that affiliate marketers confront is this. Many new affiliate marketers choose to advertise products only to make money. Before you promote a product as a beginning, ask yourself if you would buy the thing you are marketing. As an affiliate marketer, the greatest approach to take is to try to alleviate problems for people by pushing items. Before you promote a product, do some research and make sure it's the type of product that's in high demand. Promoting too many products In their eagerness and optimism, newbie affiliate marketers wind up getting their hands on many products at the same time. Instead of concentrating on promoting a single product, they begin to promote a large number of products at the same time. Consistency, not quantity, is the key here. It is recommended that you identify and focus your interest on a few remarkable objects. hoping to become wealthy overnight? People have a common misperception about affiliate marketing: that they can become successful and wealthy overnight. There is no shortcut to success; it is the consequence of constant hard work and dedication. Affiliate marketing is similar to any other type of business. If you want to make a living as an affiliate marketer, you'll need a lot of money, time, work, and dedication, and it won't happen quickly. Not giving keywords research priority. Although it is simple to choose less competitive keywords and have fewer competitors, the income will be limited in this scenario. On the other hand, if you spend your limited cash on high-competitive keywords, you will receive a better outcome. Most rivals, in the beginning, choose to employ short-tail keywords rather than studying long-tail keywords. As a result, the rankings do not display on the top or second pages of the search results. Long-tail keywords, on the whole, are more precise, less competitive, and easier to target. One of the most common mistakes made by newbies to affiliate marketing is disregarding long-tail keywords. Final thoughts Last but not least, building a successful career in affiliate marketing needs a significant amount of commitment, enthusiasm, education, and patience on your part. Furthermore, you must keep up with current marketing trends and focus on establishing effective relationships with your clients through high-quality traffic and useful product recommendations. In many cases, affiliate marketers fail because they employ deceptive tactics, and the information presented above is an example of some of the most prevalent affiliate marketing blunders. It is not difficult to be successful in affiliate marketing if you follow the guidelines and have practical expertise.

But that is still highly debatable. The wording is as follows: ‚ÄúA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.‚Äù As long ago as 1939, the Supreme Court declared that this Amendment meant that people could only carry guns for military use in a militia, not for personal use at home. That much should be clear anyway, for the subsidiary clause ‚Äúbeing necessary to the security of a free State‚Äù indicates that the militia is for the protection of the State, not the individual. With this in mind, the District of Columbia passed a law in 1975 prohibiting the private possession of handguns, loaded rifles and loaded shotguns, with the deliberate purpose of making Washington safer from the turbulence caused by murder with firearms. In 2008, in DC v Heller, the Supreme Court revisited the definition and reversed itself. By a 5-4 majority, the Justices opined that the Amendment guarantees the right of individuals to bear arms for non-military uses, with breathtaking disregard for the meaning of the words.\\" Full article is here: [LINKED_TEXT: Why Are Americans So Obsessed With Guns?] [URL: http://www.businessinsider.com/why-are-americans-so-obsessed-with-guns-2012-12?IR=T]"},{"instruction":"Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?","output":"FIND YOURSELF AND KNOW WHO YOU ARE..

A mediator gets parties together, people who disagree, and helps them find some common ground, some compromise.

Should I exploit that?","output":"Yes. I can tell you first hand that you should. There could be a bit of money in it for you. There are different ways to exploit it. Voice overs on radio, movies and TV. If you are in a band, you could sing the Beatle songs and better yet, get into a Beatles Tribute band. But that would depend on if you can play an instrument. So anyway, make a copy of the songs you sing, send them into radio stations, or make a You Tube or Tik Tok video of you singing. You never know. Get into a band. Make sure you have the perfect Beatle cut. Here‚Äôs my story. When I was younger, I found I could mimic voices and sound like movie actors and cartoon characters. As I got older, I got better. Rich Little and Frank Gorshin who were voice impersonators were my heros. When The Beatles came out, I found with practice I could talk like them with their thick Liverpudlian accents. In fact, when I met a new girl I‚Äôd put on my accent and say I was RJ McCartney, Paul‚Äôs cousin. It always worked. Of course I‚Äôd have to break the truth to them later but by then, they knew me. When I played drums in my band, I would sing Beatle songs. I could get John‚Äôs nasally twang, Ringo‚Äôs voice and George‚Äôs thick accent. Paul was a little tougher, he had a hell of a range. But I did Paul‚Äôs easier songs. Back in the USSR and Lady Madonna. Trying out for a Beatles tribute band, I sang Boys and A Little Help From my Friends. Happy to say that I got the job. One of the biggest thrills of my life. In fact, I did a radio commercial in our city. A fashion store started selling Beatle caps. My sisters were there shopping and started talking to the manager about Beatle fashions and they just happened to tell him that their younger brother talked just like the Beatles. That‚Äôs how I got the radio commercial. And yes, being the sisters they are, they bought me a Beatle‚Äôs cap home. ‚ÄúHello mates. I heard they are selling the new Beatle caps at Carstair‚Äôs Fashions on Main. They‚Äôve got a lot of gear fashions there. Hey, I‚Äôve got my cap already, why don‚Äôt you bounce down and get yours? All sizes. Pure wool. They‚Äôre fab. Oh, tell em‚Äô Ringo sent you.‚Äù Only done with a Ringo accent. If you can sing or talk like a Beatle, you can even be the life of the party, even today. The very first Beatle song I sang was Do You Want to Know a Secret. I sang in exactly like George, heavy accent at all. It was and still is one of my facourite‚Äôs. So there‚Äôs a lot you can do, even start your own Beatle tribute band. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"Stock market: Investing in individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allows you to become a partial owner of companies. This option can provide potential long-term growth, but it also carries risks, as stock prices can be volatile.Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations. They pay periodic interest over a fixed period and return the principal amount at maturity. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks and can provide a steady income stream.Mutual funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They are managed by professionals and offer a convenient way to gain exposure to a variety of investments.Real estate: Investing in real estate can involve purchasing properties for rental income or capital appreciation.

I also never watch ‚Äòreality‚Äô shows, because the only ‚Äòreality‚Äô aspect of these silly shows is that the cast are not high profile celebs. I vaguely knew of trump, but never really paid him much mind and watched the Apprentice only a few times. How the show became so popular was a mystery to me; how could anyone enjoy people gossiping and back stabbing each other. I guess the catchphrase ‚Äòyou‚Äôre fired‚Äô is what made the show.. But I digress‚Ä¶ I also didn‚Äôt really pay much attention to US politics, except to realize that the US electoral system is strange, cumbersome and WAYYY too long. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how such a large country could function properly IF the Congress and president were at odds and fighting each other.. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Anyway.. One day I happen to catch part of the RNC debates between the potential candidates‚Ä¶ Seems a few of the ‚Äòdebaters‚Äô were exchanging insults and barbs about the size and effectiveness of their ‚Äòpackages‚Äô. WTH??? I tuned into CNN & MSNBC a few times (we don‚Äôt get fox news in Canada). Most of the evening hours were spent discussing Trump. So I decided to do some checking on this ‚Äòphenomenon?‚Äô What I found were articles spanning years that showed trump to be a very poor businessman, with thousands of lawsuits, several bankruptcies and many failed business adventures. In fact, if he hadn‚Äôt received MILLIONS from his father, he likely would be a low level used car salesman. I read the story about his failed venture into the Casino game in Atlantic City. He got several really BIG breaks on his property taxes and chicanery by his father which allowed him to scam investors in the casino. The Taj Mahal Casino also was fined under the RICO act and also for discrimination. The casino failed, the investors lost their money and trump walked away with approximately 600,000. There were lots of articles indicating that trump had some pretty close connections to mobsters and other criminal elements. I found several articles about his cruelty, discrimination and outright meanness as a landlord/developer. He was charged a couple of times for discriminating against colored people; he was exposed as using predatory tactics like cutting off the heat & water to rental properties he owned in order to force the people out, so he could raise the rents. I learned that many, many buildings bearing the trump name were not owned by trump. Instead, he was pimping out his name and getting lucrative ‚Äòmanagement‚Äô contracts for said buildings. There were also several scandals regarding failed property developments where trump advertised that he was the developer and/or an investor. During his campaign, three scandals became public‚Ä¶ Trump University where he was sued for defrauding his ‚Äòstudents‚Äô and that the university was in essence a variation of a Ponzi Scheme. Then it was revealed that trump charity gave big donations to the election campaigns of AG‚Äôs in Texas and Florida and the investigations into his phony university were dropped. That led to investigations into his charities and evidence that several trump ‚Äòcharities‚Äô were using donor monies for the benefit of trump & co. Then came the tape where trump bragged about being a sexual predator. That alone would have finished any other candidate, but suddenly, the FBI announced it was re-opening the investigation into HRC‚Äôs e-mails. The ensuing media coverage of that drowned out the ‚Äòp***sy grabbing tape, although Billy Budd suffered the fallout. After 16+ women came forward and confirmed that he was indeed a sexual predator who also walked in the dressing rooms to ogle the naked teen contestants of his beauty contests. At this time a lady came forward and accused trump of raping her at J. Epstein‚Äôs estate when she was a young teen. The statute of limitations passed, so she was suing him. The case never went to court and the results remain a mystery - payment and a NDA? During this time, trump said ALL those women were lying and he would prove it after the election. Almost four years later and we‚Äôre still waiting. Then he bragged that he didn‚Äôt pay taxes because ‚Äòhe was smart‚Äô, but he promised to close the loopholes that allowed ultra rich people like him to pay next to nothing in taxes. He was the ONLY candidate who did not release any tax returns (standard practice since the Nixon days). He said he would release them after the election. Almost 4 years later and not only has he NOT released his returns, but is using every tool available (including flunky Mnuchin) to keep them hidden. He not only DID NOT close the loopholes, he added more loopholes, because those multi-millionaires and multi-billionaires need to keep their . I watched a couple of his hate fest rallies and they were disgusting. He ranted and raged and insulted practically everyone on the planet. The rallies in many cases reminded me of uncontrollable, violent lynch mobs. So, after all this, I thought there is no way in hell that this crude, vulgar, petty, barely coherent man could get elected ‚Äî he should have been in jail! When he was elected, I thought his term would be a disaster. It is WORSE! It has proven to be an absolute, chaotic, debacle, travesty of a clown trainwreck. The ‚Äòswamp‚Äô that he promised to drain has become a giant, stinking, scum filled cesspool of clueless, brain dead, self-serving, reptiles of the worst order. Well here we are in year four of the most corrupt, cheating, lying, scamming, obstructing, petty, vindictive, vulgar, cruel, ignorant, anti-american, unchristian, power abusing, incompetent wannabe dictator to ever defile the WH. Even more amazing, he STILL has 40% support! And he has somehow managed to get a cult following of gullible, delusional, uninformed fools. IMO, the USA has devolved into a de facto dictatorship - thanks to the equally corrupt, lying, cheating, self-serving, sycophants in the party of trump (formerly the gop).

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","output":"By the second half of your last sentence, I believe the first half to be incorrect: you do NOT understand the historical reasons for the electoral college. It is not there as a way to make up for the limitations of antiquated modes of communication. Thay wouldn't even make any sense. How would it? It is adding ANOTHER layer of complexity to the process, requiring MORE time and effort than a pure popular vote would, even back when it was first created. The notion that the electoral college was originally intended to avoid communication delays is a fiction that started being preached when Democrats started losing elections that they thought that they had won. It is, and has always been there to ensure that we have, as the founders intended, a republic, and not a pure democracy. The founders correctly recognized that a pure democracy is ‚Äútwo wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner‚Äù. It not only allows, but ensures the tyranny of the majority. The electoral college system helps prevent that by ensuring that the result of an election is not ever determined by a numerical majority of voters in a geographical minority of locations. Removing the electoral college results in something like the Hunger Games, where the country is ruled by a populous and affluent metropolitan area, and the less populous, more rural areas have absolutely no say in the policies that govern them. This is especially problematic because large metropolitan population centers tend to be much more uniform in their political views than utlying areas, as well as being uniformly uninformed about the issues and realities of life outside the big cities. Historically, Democrats play to the inclinations of the large cities, and even demonize the rural areas in order to ensure a win in those important voting blocs. The gamble that they make is that by clinching the metropolitan vote, they risk losing the rest of the country. The Republicans usually do the opposite. They campaign in a much more broadly appealing way. This means that they often lose several minority votes, as well as the votes of the cities who loyally vote for Democrats who pander to those minorities. On he balance, they gain enough of the test of the country that they can offset the choke hold the Democrats have on the major cities. The fact that sometimes Democrats win the popular vote, but lose the election is an intentional feature, not a bug. Systems of pure democracy have ALWAYS very quickly become tyrannical, and ended up as totalitarian dictatorships. This was known to the founders at the time they designed our system of government, and was accounted for in their designs. This is the same reason we have a Senate instead of just a mob of Representatives. In fact, for a while, the founders debated having the Senate elect the president directly, since each state gets exactly 2 senators. This was thrown out since it unfairly benefited the least populous states. The electoral college was found to be the best compromise between senatorial and popular elections. Because of the electoral college system, candidates need to run a campaign that appeals to ALL states, and not just a select few with a high population. The Democrats keep forgetting this, and then when they lose, they blame the system. Hillary Clinton didn't even visit several states, and when they didn't vote for her, she complained that it wasn't fair. The rules haven't changed. She knew them going into the race. Her husband had the exact same system to deal with when he was elected. Democrats only complain about them when they lose."},{"instruction":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, ‚ÄúNope, not worth it‚Äù and just left?","output":"Yes, the usual calls to attend public order issues, fights, etc. In these cases, by the time you arrive at the location, the fight/argument finished just after it started, and the location is empty."},{"instruction":"Do respected veteran programmers consider PHP programmers Real Programmers?","output":"Many considerable programmers usually take care what you create than how many languages you know or use.

I had been working from William Milsom‚Äôs lab at the University of British Columbia, and while it was a comparative physiology lab that investigated respiratory physiology, Bill will tell you a common underpinning to all the various projects was an investigation into why we DON‚ÄôT breathe. It makes sense to anyone the importance of breathing, but there are situations that sometimes arise where our brain literally on some level goes ‚Äúok, that‚Äôs enough‚Ä¶let‚Äôs flirt with death‚Äù and shuts down breathing. In the human condition, there are two well known expressions of this: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Centrally-Derived Sleep Apnea. Most people think of sleep apnea being the result of some sort of obstruction in the airway, but in Centrally-Derived Sleep Apnea the offending meat stopping breathing is the brain. Both cases are notoriously hard to study first hand due to the simple fact that‚Ä¶well, you‚Äôre typically uncertain you‚Äôve got a case until some poor soul is dead. Plus, there is so many issues that interfere with trying to study humans. So in the Milsom lab we studied animals that for one reason or another would express periods of non-breathing in their lives that were more reliable to record. Animals that hibernate tend to breathe episodically, air-breathing animals that dive hold their breath while doing so, and so on. Due to some preliminary work by some colleagues in Brasil, it looked as though they had uncovered a hibernating lizard that while hibernating at warmer temperatures tended to breathe continuously, while at colder temperatures tended to breathe episodically. This would allow us a model to investigate the temperature impact on breathing, and so I set off to Brasil to investigate this more thoroughly. Now for myself, I tend to be a bit neurotic when I‚Äôm recording my experiments. From earlier research I had done, I was of the opinion it was a really good idea to record more than just the focal signal you‚Äôre interested in as sometimes one‚Äôs assumption on that signal can be erroneous. With these lizards (Brasilian giant tegus, Salvator merianae), I had instrumented them with relatively sophisticated telemetry that allowed me to record their core body temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate. I also placed a large number of data loggers around their environment to record temperatures, light levels, ambient weather, and then sat back to let the tegus do their thing‚Ä¶and my research wound up being nearly completely derailed by what we assume was some sort of military installation that would every now and then ‚Äúkick in‚Äù and when it did‚Ä¶our telemetry signal was completely obliterated by some broad-band EMF that would drown out everything in the region (including radio and tv signals) for anything for a few minutes to even days. This didn‚Äôt completely destroy our investigation, but it caused us a lot of problems. However, because of my thoroughness in recording a bunch of signals, when it came ‚Äúspring‚Äù I noticed a couple of events that we couldn‚Äôt reconcile with our standard view of reptilian physiology. The ‚Äúwinter‚Äù in this part of Brasil is dry and cool, while ‚Äúspring‚Äù is typically hot days with cool nights, often with rainfall. While most tegus are inactive during the hibernation or ‚Äúbrumation‚Äù period of the winter, during spring they resume activity, coming out to bask in the morning sun. I recorded a couple incidences where a tegu had left their burrows in the morning, got caught in rainfall resulting in a rapid loss of core body temperature, and so would retreat back to their burrows‚Ä¶and their body temperature would rapidly climb back to where it was before they left the burrow. Now, the data loggers I had sitting about their enclosure may not have been sufficiently placed to record exactly what was taking place at the focal point of the lizard, but with the telemetry signal the thermal recovery of the tegu was more rapid than should be physically possible unless the animal was literally lying on top of a hot plate. We set out to then test the idea of where this heat was coming from‚Ä¶and uncovered the first known incidence of a non-avian reptile endogenously producing heat as a primary metabolic product instead of a secondary by-product (a fancy way of saying they purposely produced body heat physiologically)."},{"instruction":"Which Bollywood actresses can be Bollywood‚Äôs JLo and Shakira?

Sure, the Bulls franchise had a great decade in the 1990s, led by Michael Jordan, giving them the third-most championships of all time (6). However, that‚Äôs slightly over 1/3 of what the Celtics (17) and Lakers (16) have. The Spurs (60.2%) are the all-time NBA leader in franchise win/loss percentage, slightly ahead of Los Angeles (59.6%) and Boston (59.0%). Chicago is a distant 10th place at just 51.8%, well behind the leaders in this category. Los Angeles has made the playoffs in an impressive 60 of their 71 years of existence (most in NBA history), an 84.5% success rate. San Antonio has made the playoffs an incredible 46 out of 52 years of existence, an 88.5% success rate that is easily the best in the NBA. Boston made the playoffs 55 out of 73 seasons, a 75.3% success rate. Chicago has made the playoffs in 35/53 seasons, a very respectable 66% success rate, but one that distinctly lags behind the other three franchises I mentioned. If I were ranking franchise accomplishments, Los Angeles and Boston are clearly #1 and #2 - those historical championship numbers are difficult to top. After that, San Antonio would appear to be the clear-cut #3. Chicago‚Äôs one extra championship thanks to one decade under Jordan doesn‚Äôt offset the Spurs‚Äô vastly superior consistency over their five decades of existence."},{"instruction":"What are the most amazing photos you have ever taken?","output":"2020"},{"instruction":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","output":"Regarding your this concern you can [LINKED_TEXT: check this out.] [URL: https://www.fiverr.com/share/We42DE] It must be 100 percent helpful."},{"instruction":"keep working out, but I'm not seeing any progress.

But not all of them serves the best. Let‚Äôs know the name of few professional image editing software- Adobe Photoshop Yes, this is one of the most magical and amazingly the best photo editor in software versions. Famous or not, newbie or experienced every single photographer‚Äôs pc has this software. Why? Because maybe it provides features that you may call your fairy godmother! Why fairy godmother? Because you can do the best photo manipulation in here. Easily change the color panels. You can work in many layers. Also, you can easily remove background photoshop of any parts in photos in less than a minute. So you see, it‚Äôs one of the best photo editor in the software version.

Besides, professional photo editors use this softer to edit their photos more perfectly. Also, for 2D or 3D vector arts, vexel arts, line art vectors, etc. Adobe Lightroom This software is considered another best photo editor when it comes to processing photos and management. The fun part is, although lightroom and Photoshop both came from Adobe. There are almost two particular groups among the photographers and photo editors. One group thinks Adobe Lightroom is better than Adobe Photoshop for editing. Another thinks Photoshop is best. I, for one, support Photoshop. Because, although lightroom provides excellent management or processing. Even after being organized to modules so that it has a logical workflow and all other things aside, Photoshop gives you an extra edge as the best photo editor in photo manipulation or photography world. The professional photo editors don‚Äôt work in Adobe Lightroom. So doesn‚Äôt Clipping Amazon. Almost 99.99% of the photographers and photo editors go for the Adobe pack. But if you want to try any other software as the best photo editor. Then I say go for the Snapseed.

It‚Äôs true that places with stricter regulation have less violence, but the causality almost certainly runs the other way. Voters are more willing to give up guns when crime is low. Also places with stricter regulation tend to have politics dominated by rich people in majority groups who trust the police to defend them, rather than the poor, minority and unpopular groups who are the ones at risk of being convicted on gun charges. The best argument for gun regulation is not that one specific regulation will reduce homicides, accidents, suicides or crime in general; but that long-term government discouragement of gun ownership and use will ratchet down societal violence‚Äîmore or less like what happened with smoking. It doesn‚Äôt seem implausible that decades of continuing harassment of gun owners and users could lead to the US having a gun homicide rate similar to, say, Canada. That‚Äôs not likely to convince many pro-gun people, but it‚Äôs not a position calculated to enrage them either. You may get some respect for your point of view. You‚Äôre not making foolish claims, nor demonstrating a deep ignorance about guns. You don‚Äôt like guns, the way many people don‚Äôt like smoking, and you‚Äôd like to get rid of them by making life more difficult for people who own and use guns.

Why or why not?","output":"Ever seen a predator calmly watch its prey, calculating its moves, waiting for the right time to pounce?. Well, that is what I feel about Karma. I am a huge believer of it myself and sometimes I get to face its consequences pretty instantly. Has it ever happened to anyone else or has anybody noticed it like I have?. For instance, if I, in my own mind happen to say 'mock someone or make fun of someone', I instantly get hurt, My elbow bangs into something or I hit my toe to the door accidentally, I always end up with small bruises and cuts that I can count back to something bad I said or thought moments earlier on. Recently my mother wanted to show off to my neighbor on my aunt being able to drive, I come from a small town and its kind of a big deal for women to drive here, it is getting progressive but it isn't there yet. I had a very bad feeling about it and the very same day, my aunt ended up accidentally slamming the car door with my hand still stuck to its side. Luckily I had no broken fingers, however the ring I was wearing did end up getting squashed against my finger and that caused a lot of pain. The bragging in the morning flashed in front of my eyes as I tried to remove my hand and I knew that I was somehow paying for it. All that aside, I do have an interesting true story about karma to share. I recently decided to take a long break from work and I moved back to my home town to spend some time with my mother. As early risers, my mother and I start with our daily chores as the dawn breaks and I happened to notice that her cell phone would start ringing even at such early hours and it would continue through out the day. This happened for quite a few days and I noticed it was the same caller every time. When my mother would not be busy, she would answer the calls but I could see that she definitely felt annoyed if the phone kept ringing even if she had cut the call multiple times signifying she was busy. This caller, however, was relentless and that infuriated me as well. So, I finally asked her what was it all about and that is when I heard one of the most beautiful stories about Karma and its laws. You see, A long time ago, my mother happened to apply for a post as an executive assistant to a Government office. She stumbled upon the recruitment mentioned in a small post in a newspaper, and since a lot of people ignored such posts, there were only 3 people including her that sent in the applications. Out of the 3, my mother was the most suitable one, she was young, smart and vibrant, was a decent writer, had acquired typing skills and was pursuing further education. She was very positive with her prospects and was immensely happy that she would finally have a job for herself. Being hired by the Government is a pretty big deal in my town. It means a stable salary, a calendar with flexible working hours, the benefit of studying while working and better healthcare privileges. When the day arrived for the result, my mother was heartbroken to find out that the job had been given to one of the 2 people remaining. She learnt that the Hiring Manager was an uncle to the applicant and had decided to give him the job simply due to family ties and not on any merit or actual requirements. She sobbed all the way home and I believe her faith had been shaken for sometime. My Mother is such an altruist that sometimes she returns home barefoot or shivering without a jacket because she gives them away to someone in need. So, when my father expired and she was able to secure herself in his job to keep the family going, a lot of people going through similar situations approached her for help. That is when she was approached by a lady who had lost her father and needed to get his job as it was their family's only means to livelihood. It was the same lady who called her day in and day out. My mother had helped her get her papers ready, had even traveled with her to the head offices (it is a 36 hours journey back and fro), and had taught her ways on how to work around the system. The lady had been unsuccessful even after several attempts and had become increasingly worried over the years. That is why she would keep calling my mum seeking reassurance which she claimed my mother's wise words and patience gave to her. My mother always encouraged her to keep trying and never give up. It's been 10 years since her father has passed and the lady with my mother's help is still fighting the case. As you all may have guessed by now, Her father was the same Hiring Manager who had unfairly given the job to his cousin years ago instead of my mum. My mum ended the story versing 'what you so, you reap'. She is still helping the lady with her case, the lady still calls her all day long but I am no longer bothered by it. I am just grateful that I have a mother who believes in helping others no matter what."},{"instruction":"What places in San Francisco do celebrities hang out?","output":"I would google that.

If Muslims the whole world over had of responded with ‚Äúyou burned our quran, so what‚Äù. What would have been the outcome from this? Nothing and it likely would have caused less future quran burnings because they can see it doesn‚Äôt bother anyone. Look at what Muslims really did. They rioted and smashed up Sweden, they rioted and smashed up France, they rioted and smashed up Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. Probably other places too. They made such a huge issue over this book being burned and acted like it was the worst thing in the world to them. Their own actions have shown Muslims cannot integrate with other cultures, cannot act civil, cannot respond logically. They are a primitive thinking violent cult. That is their actions and how everyone knows they always respond. Showing you are a primitive violent cult I would say goes a long way in supporting the notion of ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù. People are afraid and hesitant of Islam because they know its followers cannot react to any slight in a reasonable manner. They always turn to extreme violence and murder. What compounds all of the above issues is when you see the group who burned the Quran in the first place. They were protesting Muslims mass raping Swedish women. This is now the fourth Quran they‚Äôve burned in two years because Muslims cannot and will not stop mass raping Swedish women. The outcome of this current burning is clear - Muslims care so much about their religion but they want to mass rape and sex attack women more and seemingly cannot stop themselves. Just like they cannot stop themselves resorting to mass violence The quran burning has been the worst thing for Islam, as it has, once again, showed the world what it is dealing with when it comes to Islam. Primitive, irrational savages who always turn to violence and rape and cannot stop themselves. I think the group who burned the Quran have achieved exactly what they set out to in showing the real Islam."},{"instruction":"w long does a hairbrush spanking hurt after?","output":"I had my bare bottom spanked with a hairbrush last week.

Your mind is kind of like a computer. It can be hacked, and the information can be used against you. They can see your memories and minick your friends and family perfectly. You won't be able to tell the difference. The problem is you can't tell how many demons they're are. One demon can be manifesting all the voices and having all the conversations with itself. The reason it does this is because it has a stronger effect being a group as opposed to one being. Even though the voices may sound like Bevis and Butthead they are very intelligent. These are all strategies that they use to control and manipulate you. By no means, engage in conversation. Once you do there is no going back. You may have to hear them but don't have to listen to them. The more attention you give them the stronger they get. You want to expell them early. The longer they stay in your body the harder it is to get them out. If you have any addictions, including sexual addiction, and addictive behaviors, they need to go. Then get a full deliverance.

I think it‚Äôs simpler and not much less efficient to break the problem up into finding the node with the highest index and finding the total number of nodes separately. I decided to write it out for no good reason. This finds the node with highest index (counting from 1): int highestIndex(TreeNode n, int index) { if (n->left) { index = highestIndex(n->left, 2*index); } if (n->right) { int tmp = highestIndex(n->right, 2*index+1); if (tmp > index) { index = tmp; } } return index; } However if the internal nodes of the tree maintain the height of their subtrees, then this can be made much more efficient by only descending into one of the two subtrees: int highestIndex(TreeNode n, int index) { if (n->left && (!n->right || n->left->height > n->right->height)) { return highestIndex(n->left, 2*index); } if (n->right) { return highestIndex(n->right, 2*index+1); } return index; } Then we need to know the size of the tree. If we don‚Äôt keep track of the size explicitly (for which there would probably not be an excuse) we can find it with int size(TreeNode n) { if (!n) return 0; return 1+size(n->left) + size(n->right); } Finally, the number of nodes required to complete the tree is now easy: int missingNodes(TreeNode n) { return size(n) - highestIndex(n,1); }"},{"instruction":"What are some suggestions for a math HL IA topic in calculus?","output":"My IA is evaluating the effectiveness of compartmental models as projections of epidemics, and has so far involved simple polynomial differentiation, differentiation using chain rule, and I am looking to include integration as a method of pulling data from the graphs I have produced.

Their communication style would be respectful, yet determined, validating and clear. They would be able to communicate expectations , rules, goals clearly. They would stand firm for their values and won‚Äôt hang their flag according to the wind. This would make them look trustworthy and competent. Any person who lacks these abilities, someone who‚Äôd blame their followers for not achieving, is not a leader at all. It‚Äôs just another one of those wannabes that roam the earth. Anger, impatience, lack of empathy, haughtiness, egocentrism, these are all qualities which show that a person is not free at all. Whereas a true leader has to be a person of integrity, grounded, attentive, caring, independent, not ego-stricken and threatening but self-assured. Aggressive little men are by no means free and proud but entitled and weak. A person like that may claim to be a leader but they aren‚Äôt and they‚Äôll never be with a mindset like that.

Archaeologist Dragoslav Srejoviƒá, the head of the research, began to realize that the excavation took him back several thousand years. Unexpectedly, Lepenski Vir, 10,000 years old, was discovered from the darkness. On the banks of the mysterious river Danube, a man of prehistory was discovered, whose figures represent the first monumental portraits in European history. It is certainly the most beautiful and hidden culture of prehistory. While in the rest of the world, in the transitional Stone Age (Mesolithic), life was reduced to primitive hunting and fishing, on the Serbian and Romanian coasts, in a period of 9,500. up to 5,500. years before our era, there was a sacred culture. At that time, Lepenski Vir was a world cultural and spiritual metropolis. Man as a universal being began his \\"civilized\\" development in this area, after leaving the caves in which he lived from the end of the Ice Age (around 20,000 BC) to around 10,000 BC, when the weather warmed up. In the cultural layer of Lepenski Vir, the oldest projections of thoughts, feelings, beliefs and fears are contained. The realism that was then developing in art shows the beginning of attachment to idols, which is best shown by the examples of sculptures with a fish-like appearance as an allusion to fishing and fertility, the main occupation of the inhabitants of Lepenski Vir. In fact, the dominant female forms of sculpture express the oldest deep respect for the natural cycles of birth and death. The artistic creation of these people represents the very beginning of the expression of collective consciousness. The people of that time, especially in order not to get lost on the open sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe horizon, were constantly looking for Meaning. The inhabitants of Lepenski Vir finally found spirituality in the triangle of cosmic power. One cannot, in fact, understand Lepenski Vir without understanding the figure of a triangle or a pyramid. The geometric shape of the triangle was constantly repeated in Lepenski Vir. Right across Lepenski Vir, a geometrically regular trapezoid rose, Treskavac hill, as an incredible astronomical landmark for those people. The Lepenska house-tent was also built in the shape of a triangle with a trapezoidal base cut at the top, and with its elements of a hearth and altar, it was a link between otherworldly and earthly life. This man of Lepenski Vir thoroughly understood the Cosmos in the form of a three-sided pyramid, holding that the world has a spherical concept, which was only much more systematically articulated by Pythagoras much later in ancient Greece. Cults of the Sun and the Dead The construction of the house with a spherical shape was especially important for the performance of magical rituals by the inhabitants of Lepenski Vir. There was a fireplace in the central part. It was their microcosm. Pythagoras' model of the cosmos, as stated by Zivojin Andrejic, just, not by chance, had fire in its sphere - light in the shape of a triangle. Namely, for the inhabitants of Lepenski Vir, the birth of new life / light was the most important. However, they believed that only the spirits of the dead could give life to children by entering them after conception. Because of that, the people of Lepen tried to get in touch with the spirits and encourage childbirth with rituals near the hearth / stomach of the woman and the altar / navel. The dead were therefore buried with their legs together in the shape of a triangle (yoga position) under the hearth. The living lived with the dead, and the world of the living and the dead permeated. The ancestor, therefore, was important to these people, and the connection with underground life was very strong. This archetype of burial first existed with the Indian sect Aghori, according to Andrejiƒá, who even today meditate by sitting on corpses that bury their legs crossed. For the shamanistic practices of Lepenac, the house was crucial, it was a mystery of life and death, that is, a ritual construction. The opening on the domed front of the house is also designed for a reason. It had the purpose of allowing the sun's rays to enter the house space at different points. At sunrise, on June 21, the summer solstice, when divine beings appear more easily due to the \\"triumph of light\\", the opening then introduced the sun's rays into the whole space, and depending on the time of year and the need for divinity, the paths of light were directed and March 21, September 23, as well as December 21, which indicates infinity (spinning wheel) .The house was built to worship the sun deity and dead ancestors.Although, the dome and arched structure of the house of Lepenski Vir humanity still uses in construction On top of all that, only natural materials such as wood, sand, chaff, mud, reeds, clay, etc. were used for the construction of the Lepenski house. Therefore, the settlement of Lepenski Vir was a living and complex organism functionally integrated into the ecosystem. as a [LINKED_TEXT: http://whole.In] [URL: http://whole.in/] today's words, the functions of settlements have inevitably resonated with patterns of sustainable development and environmental protection. In general, Lepenski Vir was not only a necropolis, because of the life of the living with the dead, but also a heliopolis, because of the cult of the Sun, which Lepenci modeled as a symbol of house space, which later became the center of spirituality of many civilizations, peoples and secret societies. Raising the consciousness of humanity Unlike today's man, Lepenci did not seek security in society, but in nature. The man of Lepenski Vir did not think of himself as the center of the world, but of nature and the world as the center of everything that exists. The cosmos was viewed as an absolute and mystical reality. In such a holistic picture, people did not perceive themselves as gods. Man, together with nature, was taken as the ultimate goal and measure of everything. The man at the time was not covered by social chains and obscured by delusions. Compared to today, the people of that time had an awareness of the world as a common home in which the divine message was inscribed. That power of Lepenac, reflected in the knowledge of cosmogony, enabled man as a being to live deeply with nature, intuitively feel the divine order and thus approach the organization of life, according to Andrejiƒá. Even then, according to him, man understood the eternal and unchanged order. The discovered regularities of the biological cycle gave a stimulus to the development of the sedimentary life of the community, which initiated numerous innovations in proto-urbanism and agriculture, which are still indispensable today. The first elements of animal husbandry and farming were developed, and the collection and planting of seeds and the use of animal herds began. Animal domestication and the revolution in agriculture provided food and gave the settlements permanence, affecting overall sexuality and population production. The relationship between a man and a woman thus changed, and the inhabitants of Lepenski Vir, forming a permanent settlement, laid the foundations of the present civilization. \\"If we were to remove the industrial revolution,\\" claims archaeologist Boban Tripkovic, \\"it would be clear that there are only cultural contents that originated in Lepenski Vir,\\" and last until our time. \\" The first traces of literacy were also made there. The signs of Lepenski Vir eventually formed a letter. A 9,000-year-old stone altar with graphics, which resemble symbols and letters intended for magical rituals, which are also based on a triangle, is most likely the basis from which the alphabet of later civilizations originated. Archaeologist Dragan Jacanoviƒá points out that the graffiti found on that object is the oldest found letter in the world, representing \\"the message sent by the great-grandfather and the only question is whether we will be able to decipher it\\". Academician Srejoviƒá well noticed that \\"Lepenski Vir shows that Europe did not have to receive the population and culture from the Middle East ... the newly discovered culture of Lepenski Vir is proof that this feat was done in Europe independently. Its unexpected discovery and its remarkable forms show that our knowledge of cultural pathways is still limited. \\" As the oldest spiritual and material culture in the world, Lepenski Vir, in fact, revealed the secret that a white man from the Danube region set out to spread his civilizational heritage from Central Europe to Asia Minor. That is, by the way, the truth about Europe and the Balkans, which was not always backward and backward. The greatest strength of Lepenac was contained in their communicativeness and mobility, based on symbols, signs, markings and ornaments. The spiritual and material message they created 10 millennia ago was then sent to others, and the most fruitful legacy was accepted by the Vinƒça civilization, which also had its center in the Danube region. We owe the discovery of the rich and luxurious culture of Vinƒça to the archeological research led by Professor Miloje Vasiƒá from 1908 to 1934. \\"During prehistory, Serbia was the cultural center of Europe in two ways,\\" says Dragoslav Srejovic, claiming that after the Lepenski Vir civilization, a millennium later, between 4,500 and 3,500 BC, the territory of Serbia \\"again became the cultural center of prehistoric Saint\\". In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBelgrade, in the vicinity of today's Vinƒça and Banjica, a par excellence Neolithic culture was created. With the amount of artifacts, over a hundred ceramic fragments, Vinƒça poses an incomprehensible riddle to the curious human spirit. Vinca's horizons have a great, irresistible magnetic power, as archaeologist Dragoslav Srejoviƒá said. The area where this culture spread included, in addition to the territory of Serbia, parts of today's Romania, Bulgaria and Macedonia. Some 150 kilometers from Belgrade, the prehistoric society of the Vinca Neolithic culture also lived in Romania, in the towns of Turdash and Parac near Timisoara, as well as in Karanovo in Bulgaria. It is important to underline that Vinca is in continuity with the culture of Lepenski Vir. In addition, the flourishing and achievements of Vinca put it in equivalent with the development of the entire Neolithic culture (5,500-2,200 BC). The Neolithic is, by the way, the period of the longest peace in history. Cultural and economic exchanges, as well as population movements, created interdependence between people from Asia Minor and Central Europe, so that conflicts and wars were not the goal of anyone. In fact, there is no evidence in the archeological layers of the Neolithic about the militant spirit of the people of the Vinƒça civilization. According to archaeologist Boban Tripkovic, \\"evidence of the existence of a developed exchange comes from Vinca.\\" The Neolithic war was thus meaningless, because the people of that period were only focused on maximizing prosperity. Knowledge was then affirmed for the first time as power. time in senseless wars, the efficiency of that society has enabled us today to possess a wealth of knowledge.Among other things, the Vinca civilization is characterized by a metallurgical revolution. In addition to metal processing, the inhabitants of Vinƒça developed the production of copper and were the first to use it to make various objects, instruments and jewelry. Enormous and advanced knowledge was reflected in precision pottery. The made ceramic and stone figures have the appearance of humanoid creatures with decorative inscriptions and symbols, as a kind of secret code left in history. The first literacy school in the world The most attractive mystical archeological detail are the imprinted letters and symbols on the ceramic fragments. Professor Miloje Vasiƒá especially emphasized that the signs appear in all archeological layers of Vinƒça, proving that the founding of Vinƒça falls in the age with literacy, which moves \\"prehistoric age, into historical age\\". But Vasic did not develop a deeper analysis. However, someone did. Professor Radivoje Pe≈°iƒá zealously continued the examination of ceramic finds. The results of his research testify to the high level of literacy of people from that period. Pesic came to the conclusion that Vinca is the beginning of world literacy. According to his findings, the people of the Vinƒça culture built a system of 48 signs that were in the function of communication. It was a letter of a linear character, read from right to left, of an alphabetic character. Therefore, the Vinƒça artifacts can be considered the first school of literacy, 6,000 years old, \\"from where the written word came into the world.\\" the oldest and first letters of human civilization. Vinca thus changed the \\"chronology and place of origin and birth of world literacy.\\" The cradle of literacy from Mesopotamia thus moved towards the Danube region. The morphology and phonetic value of the Vinca alphabet, moreover, is in agreement with other alphabets. According to Pe≈°iƒá, there are 5 identical letters in the Brahma script, 3 in the Cretan linear script, and as many as 10 identical letters in the Old Phoenician script with the Vinƒça script. Ancient Greek has 12 identical letters. Also, there are a total of 20 identical letters in the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. The Vinca script was, therefore, a source of literacy for many civilizations that took on signs. But the most interesting comparison is with the Etruscan script (about 2,700 years old). The complete Etruscan alphabet, in fact, according to Pesic, is completely identical to the Vinca script. That question, however, is a Gordian knot in the search for an answer to this mystery. It is unclear, first of all, how the Etruscan people, who otherwise inhabited the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtoday's Italy around the 8th century BC, suddenly experienced development and rapid rise after their arrival. What is the origin of Etruscan civilization? The letter of the Etruscans poses the most problems in this. How is it possible, among other things, that all the characteristics of the Etruscan alphabet correspond to the archaeological materials found at sites in Serbia and Romania? The Italian archaeologist Frere offered the opinion that the Vinca alphabet was simply transferred from the Danube region to the Apennine Peninsula. After the disappearance of the Vinca civilization, the Etruscans successfully preserved the wealth of Vinca, maintaining and perfecting the Vinca script after arriving in present-day Italy. 1. Letter of Lepenski Vir (8,000 BC) 2. Vinƒça letter (4,300 BC) 3. Sumerian letter (3,100 BC) 4. Egyptian (3,000 BC) 5. Indian alphabet (2,200 BC) 6. Chinese alphabet (1,300 BC) 7. Phoenician alphabet (1,600 BC) 8. Old Hebrew alphabet (900 BC) 9. Greek alphabet (900 BC) 10. Etruscan script (900 BC) The cultural and spiritual horizons of the Danube civilizations of Lepenski Vir and Vinƒça show that \\"early civilizations\\" can no longer be linked to Sumer, Mesopotamia and Egypt. The strong and pure thoughts of the inhabitants of Lepenski Vir and Vinƒça and the very beginning of human civilization. Consciousness is the most important feature of the human species that has a universal and lasting significance, and Consciousness, which originated in Lepenski Vir and Vinƒça, is the archetype of today's collective unconscious humanity. Therefore, Europe was born and raised in the geography of the Balkans."},{"instruction":"Are accusations from a narcissist a confession?","output":"Yes ,that's how I found out a lot of my narcs childhood , he would throw things at me about my childhood that wasn't even true , when he's actually talking about his"},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"With an IQ of 150 and higher, life is much easier and much more difficult at the same time, and often for the same reasons. Allow me to explain. The likely advantage is when you are a little above average When you have an IQ that is in the 120‚Äì130 range (SD 15), you receive only advantages for your intelligence. You are average enough to be comfortable in conversation and with the work flow of most people, regardless of duration or circumstance. You are just a little quicker and more skilled, so you excel in most normal settings and situations. You relate to the same humor, you live by the same mantras, and you enjoy the same pastimes. Rules make sense to you and do not insult your intelligence. Expectations placed upon you usually seem reasonable and fair. You can feel like you belong in large crowds and will usually experience the better end of most transactions being the next level up in intelligence from average range. You will usually get B+ or A on most tests among your peers. Everyone around you thinks you are smart as you freely associate with the generally public. When you are high IQ, you constantly face disappointment Having an IQ of 150 and higher, you live a completely different life altogether. You are usually uncomfortable being lumped in with the general public, no matter what the situation is. You always feel held back, under-stimulated, and honestly quite foolish. I can speak for myself that my patience is next to zero dealing with most people in nearly every situation. Holding my peace and getting through normal situations has been an art for me, as I have to anticipate a certain amount of incompetence from others up front in my mind so that when it happens, I tell myself this was already planned for. But if someone is standing there like a deer in the headlights, I have to move past them while they try to remember what their name is. If they are spitting cliches at me as if they are wise, I have to show how oversimplified and hypocritical their logic is, as well as how pretentious and lazy they are for not thinking anything out before spouting it to others. When they present me with options, I usually have questions that need to be answered in order to make my decision that they never even thought of, never heard before, and cannot understand the meaning of. Detail, nuance, articulation, acuity‚Äîall thrown out the window unless I am working on something by myself. Everything is dumbed-down to oblivion. When I‚Äôm driving, traffic is the bane of existence and makes me wish I never saw people again. When I see what‚Äôs trending online, 9 times out of 10 times I wish for a comet to zap the Earth. I cannot overstate how ignorant and deficient most people are continually at everything. Even when I pick up groceries I am astonished why the bagger put 4 jars of sauce and a loaf of bread in the same bag, and the other lone jar of sauce in a bag with the apples and carrots. It blows my mind every day how much stupidity I have to deal with day in and day out. It‚Äôs draining and dehumanizing! Putting it in simple terms The truth is that pop culture is saturated with 85‚Äì100 IQ concepts, slogans, songs, images, attitudes, and mindsets. This is why I say if your IQ is 120‚Äì130, you are always going to feel smart, but not annoyed. You receive the advantage without the suffering. Now imagine having a 120 IQ, but sitting through a 6th grade class every day for an entire year. Then imagine the next year, still being stuck in that 6th grade class. 20, 30 years later and still you are in 6th grade. This is what it is like for a genius. Your intelligence is only understood by yourself. You can‚Äôt take advantage of your IQ because the general 6th grade is not capable of reasoning at a 120‚Äì130 adult IQ level. And neither is the general adult population capable of reasoning with an adult of 150 IQ or higher. Whenever I work, I usually operate on autopilot unless I am managing my own projects. Nobody appreciates work at a 150 or 160 IQ level when to them good is at a 100 IQ level, very good is 110, great is 120, and off the chart is 130. See what I mean? Can someone at a 100 IQ level tell the difference between a 130 IQ work of art and a 160 IQ work of art? Not any more than a 5 ft tall woman can tell the difference between a 6‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥ man a 6‚Ä≤10‚Ä≥ man. Advantages that can seldom be applied In conclusion, you have many advantages with an IQ over 150, but you can hardly apply them to life because rules are made for the lowest common denominator. If you move fast, you are told to slow down. If you think outside the box, you are punished for insubordination. If you have a grand idea, you have to scrap it for something others can also work on with you. If your IQ happens to be 170 or 180, good luck to you! You might as well be living in the jungle with baboons because no level of simplification will be enough to get your ideas across. Just talk like you‚Äôre a small child and maybe you will get along with people. No, I am not exaggerating!"},{"instruction":"lost my email password.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"You asked ‚ÄúWhat's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?‚Äù The question is too ambiguous, because how could you compare, for example, a lazy person with an IQ of 150 against a super-industrious person with an IQ of 110? What if one or the other was dishonest? Or an alcoholic? Do you see what I mean? There are too many other character traits and variables for those questions to be answered. But I'll address one instance. A person with an IQ of 150 is very smart, but isn't a genius. Nevertheless, they're smart enough to be capable of understanding the significance of the work of geniuses, usually without being capable of doing work at that level themselves. As a nicely written example, did you see the movie Amadeus [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #MagGD] ? The character Salieri was an example of that level of intelligence. He was a competent composer and musician, at the top of his field. He understood that Mozart was a genius with whom he could never compete. He could never produce work at the level of Mozart's. (In the movie Salieri was also murderously jealous. I don't mean to imply that people with IQs of 150 are necessarily jealous or violent like that. As I said above ‚Ä¶ too many variables. People are complicated.) So that's one possible attribute of such people: the ability to do good work, but also to see extreme greatness and know that it is forever beyond their grasp. If such a person is lucky, they develop compassion for themselves and for others.

Mix it up with different types of posts, such as images, videos, articles, and infographics. This will keep your followers engaged and coming back for more.Use visuals. Visual content is more engaging than text-only content, so make sure to include images, videos, and infographics in your social media posts. These types of posts are more likely to be shared and seen by others.Run contests and giveaways. Contests and giveaways are a great way to generate excitement and engagement on social media. They can also help you attract new followers and grow your audience.Promote your content. Don't just post your content and hope for the best. Promote it on other channels, such as your website, email list, and in-store signage. The more people who see your content, the more likely you are to generate engagement. 80% of social media users say that visuals are important to their decision-making process.

These global health risks include more severe droughts, floods, and heat waves, which can lead to malnutrition and food shortages, water-borne diseases, respiratory diseases and mental health problems. Global warming is affecting the lives of millions It is about to become a major public health issue, with serious implications for our long-term well-being. Yet there is little evidence that we are taking any meaningful action to reverse it. For example, low-lying areas in Bangladesh are experiencing sea level rise at a rate of 4mm per year, making coastal flooding more likely. As a result, increased migration and overcrowding are leading to rises in vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever. This year, one million new cases have been reported in affected areas already. Without effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these problems will only get worse as temperatures continue to rise. The effects of global warming will not be limited to poorer countries. Europe has experienced an increase in heat waves since 1980 and experts predict that by 2050 over 70% of Europeans will experience 20 days or more of extreme heat each year. Such events can lead to dehydration, exhaustion and death among vulnerable groups such as children, older people and those who work outdoors. How sea level rise is affecting coastal communities? As coastal waters warm, sea levels rise, weather becomes more extreme, habitats deteriorate and threats to human health increase. Coastal communities are being directly impacted by these changes, rising tides cause erosion and flooding. Warmer ocean temperatures lead to massive die-offs of coral reefs that protect coastlines from erosion. As a result disappearing mangroves harm those that live along coastlines because they provide food, protection from storms and nurseries for fisheries. The poor in developing countries suffer first as seas erode shorelines. Rising sea levels contribute to storm surges that can damage homes. Water contamination from runoff is a growing problem when higher water levels contaminate groundwater supplies. For example, Hurricane Katrina displaced thousands of people and left many homeless. In addition to their immediate needs such as shelter, food and water, victims also face long-term problems such as mental illness (e.g., post traumatic stress disorder) or chronic disease (e.g., heart disease). They may be unable to return home or find work again if their neighborhoods have been destroyed or are unsafe due to contaminated drinking water or moldy buildings damaged by high winds or flooding caused by hurricanes. Marine life is impacted by pollution and chemical runoff All marine life including humans depend on a healthy, stable environment to survive. In recent years, we have seen dramatic changes in ocean ecosystems due to pollution, overfishing, chemical runoff from farms and urban development, and warming temperatures due to climate change. For example, overfishing has upset marine food chains by removing predators that keep populations balanced. Chemical runoff creates dead zones where fish cannot survive, warmer water makes it harder for phytoplankton (plant-like organisms at the base of every marine food chain) to grow quickly enough to support larger fish species. Acidification harms coral reefs that provide shelter for fish as well as habitats for diverse forms of life, flooding destroys coastal wetlands which provide breeding grounds for fish species. These are just some examples of how climate change is impacting marine life, but all living things are impacted by these changes. Air quality impacts respiratory conditions Air pollution is associated with both lung and heart disease, especially in children. The effects of air pollution are most severe in developing countries, however, even in North America, many cities have experienced a dramatic increase in smog over recent decades. A 2015 study found that Los Angeles suffers from more polluted air than any other city in North America. Air quality is particularly poor during winter months when burning wood or coal for heating increases emissions. When we breathe polluted air, pollutants can get into our lungs and cause irritation or damage to cells. Inhaling particulate matter has also been linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and asthma. In addition to its direct effects on respiratory health, air pollution may also be indirectly linked to depression through its effect on sleep patterns. For example, if you live in an area where it is hard to find clean air outside your home (or if you simply don‚Äôt want your kids playing outside), you might be inclined to spend more time indoors and less time exercising outdoors in order to avoid exposure. While there is no direct evidence linking outdoor exercise directly with improved mood or reduced symptoms of depression, there is some evidence that it may help reduce stress levels and improve sleep patterns (which are important factors in depression). How drought affects agriculture, water supplies, & public health? Drought affects agriculture, water supplies, & public health. Droughts usually strike isolated areas in short-term cycles, however, if an area has several consecutive years of drought, it is considered a major catastrophe to all living things and their ecosystems that are affected by drought conditions. The two main types of droughts are meteorological droughts (short-term) which occur when precipitation falls below normal levels for 3 or more months, and hydrological droughts (longer-term) which occur when reservoirs reach low levels due to declining precipitation over a period of 3 or more years. Water scarcity can lead to conflicts between nations, states, communities, households and individuals. As water becomes scarcer in many parts of the world, people will be forced to compete with each other for access to water resources. Water scarcity may also lead to increased cases of disease outbreaks such as cholera and typhoid fever because these diseases thrive in warm temperatures where people do not have access to clean drinking water. In addition, crop yields will decrease because farmers cannot irrigate their crops during dry seasons resulting in higher food prices at local markets. Many developing countries will be most affected by these changes because they have limited resources and infrastructure needed to cope with severe weather events caused by climate change such as floods and droughts (IPCC). As temperatures rise, people in certain regions are more likely to lash out violently. A new study shows how climate change can affect interpersonal violence. Since 2000, both interpersonal violence and global temperature have increased around the world which raises two important questions. Do they share a link? Can an area's warming affect whether people turn violent toward one another? A new study shows that rising temperatures in many areas may indeed encourage conflict. Here is why‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãClimate change is already increasing infectious disease transmission by insects like mosquitoes, ticks and fleas. But those infected aren't just getting sick, their illnesses also carry with them some psychological changes such as aggressive behavior that can increase chances for conflicts with others, according to researchers at Ohio State University. For example, if you are feeling feverish from mosquito-borne West Nile virus or dengue fever (also spread by mosquitoes), you might be more likely to react aggressively toward others who annoy you because your brain isn't working as well as it normally does. And those feelings of aggression could lead you to say or do something you had later regret like punching someone in traffic. Risks to human safety are increasing every year as temperatures rise Those living in areas prone to natural disasters like floods, landslides, earthquakes or hurricanes face an increased risk of injury or death. Those who live in urban areas vulnerable to a rise in temperatures often have no choice but to stay in their homes, where heat-related illness can occur. These conditions also exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions such as respiratory illnesses and cancer. In addition, there is growing evidence that suggests that changing weather patterns can cause long-term mood disorders like depression. With hotter days leading to more irritability, lack of concentration and fatigue at work or school which in turn leads to reduced productivity. It is clear how [LINKED_TEXT: climate change] [URL: https://www.nirajhealth.com/climate-change-its-impact-on-our-health/] could seriously affect our quality of life. So what do we do? We should not just sit around and wait for these problems to get worse, instead we need to find ways to prevent them from happening. One way is by raising awareness of these issues so that people know how they are affected and what they can do about it. The best thing you can do is take action now, before you become a victim yourself. Rising temperatures increase violence in some areas, decrease in others A recent study has concluded that a rise in temperature by 1¬∞ Celsius increases a country‚Äôs risk of armed conflict by 14 percent. Violence occurs more often in tropical regions than temperate ones, researchers found, although they weren‚Äôt sure why. Some theorize that because tropical areas are poorer, crime is more rampant when temperatures rise. Another possibility is that hotter countries have less government-controlled territory, creating large ungoverned areas where criminal groups can thrive. Whatever the case may be, it appears warming trends could lead to even more violence as rising temperatures continue around much of the world. Animals in extreme environments suffer from heat stress, malnutrition, impaired reproduction, and death These are the things that make sense in extreme environments. And according to a report from CICERO (Norwegian Center for Climate Services), expect people living in those conditions to experience many similar effects. The report, A Human Health Perspective of Future Climate Change, says that malnutrition and impaired reproductive capacities will be common results as humans are forced to live in more extreme climates. The authors say climate change could cause a mental breakdown or exacerbate other existing problems with anxiety, depression, etc. For example, extended periods of flooding due to rising sea levels could lead to mental illness through exposure to mold or bacteria. Warmer temperatures will also increase exposure to disease-carrying insects like mosquitos which would lead to increased diseases such as malaria that thrive in warmer climates. Mental health issues caused by these changes will most likely go untreated since people may not have access to proper medical care. Conclusion Recent studies have indicated that there may be a link between climate change, or rapid environmental changes in general, and various human diseases. Examples include obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma and chronic fatigue syndrome. While it is likely that many other diseases will also be linked to environmental changes in years to come. All these conditions can have a major effect on quality of life for sufferers but may also prove to be expensive for society as a whole. For example, if people are more likely to develop heart disease due to increased temperatures, they are more likely to die earlier and so reduce their economic productivity over their lifetime. In addition, treating all these different illnesses may become very costly indeed. Although we cannot yet predict exactly how much an individual‚Äôs health will suffer from climate change, it seems prudent to take preventative action now rather than later. The best way we can do that is by reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally through greater government intervention in energy production and consumption. This would help mitigate some of the worst effects of global warming while also improving our overall health as a species. \\"The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that some one else will save it\\" [LINKED_TEXT: www.nirajhealth.com] [URL: https://www.nirajhealth.com/climate-change-its-impact-on-our-health/]"},{"instruction":"What was trench warfare like in World War I?","output":"For most soldiers it was like this.

Try to figure out what, specifically, triggers the negative behavior in your child. Make an appointment with the teacher to review what you observe. Focus your comments on events as they pertain to your son. Point out events that seem to cause your son to act up. If you do not get satisfaction from the teacher, which I suspect you won‚Äôt, move on up the chain of command to the principal, and if that doesn‚Äôt work go beyond him/her.

To help you find the follow-up schedule that‚Äôs right for you, I‚Äôd advise you to take a small test first: Try six follow-up emails in the span of a month. Follow-up with two emails/week in the first two weeks - something like one during the beginning of the week and another towards the end of the week. You can follow-up with one mail/week in the last two weeks. Once you‚Äôre done, analyze your results. Segregate the prospects into two categories here based on the engagement metrics. A tool like[LINKED_TEXT: Klenty] [URL: https://www.klenty.com/?utm_source=Quora] can help you with that. Prospects who have been consistently engaging with your emails in some or the other form like opening them, clicking some link or visiting your website etc.Prospects who have never engaged/stopped engaging with your mails after a certain point. These could be the people who moved your emails to the spam folder or are simply not interested. Now the prospects in the second category can be conveniently moved to the ‚Äúnot now‚Äù list. On the other hand, prospects in the first category can be followed up further until you get a response. But make sure not to irritate the prospects. Here are a few things to keep in mind: After the initial one month test, reduce the pace at which you check-into your prospect‚Äôs inbox. Preferably make it 2‚Äì3 emails a month.Don‚Äôt merely check-in. Prove useful to the prospect. Offer a valuable resource, evoke a smile or build credibility - treat every follow-up email as a unique opportunity to leave a positive impression.Keep testing your follow-up emails.

You don‚Äôt need to be a developer, a producer, a manufacturer or a marketplace. All you need to do is pick a few products, make a website, and run ad links. It‚Äôs super easy. Well, then, if it‚Äôs so easy, why isn‚Äôt your affiliate site making money? You‚Äôve followed all the guides, you‚Äôve bought a bunch of copy, how come the cash isn‚Äôt rolling in? You‚Äôre Not Competitive In Your Niche If you‚Äôre trying to advertise and sell an affiliate product, that product needs to have sufficient demand to support a marketer getting in on the business. If it does, typically that means there are other marketers trying to do the same thing. The larger and more lucrative the niche, the more competition it has. If you‚Äôre trying to market, say, survival tents, you need to be aware of the competition. Check out who else is trying to market survival tents, and how they‚Äôre going about it. Can you compete? Can you do something they don‚Äôt, or are you just a pale imitation of their site? You don‚Äôt want to look like the lesser option. You‚Äôre Not Targeting a Niche This is even worse. People like to think that they can market to diverse interests and get people to browse their site. This might have been true in the early days of Neatorama and other general interest blogs, but it‚Äôs not really true any more. These days, when people have three different interests, they go to three different sites, one specializing in each. You can‚Äôt make a general interest blog and make it an affiliate marketing powerhouse. You might be able to make a successful general interest site, but it‚Äôs not going to make you a lot of money in affiliate sales until you have a significant volume of users. You‚Äôre Not Advertising As the saying goes; you have to spend money to make money. Well, [LINKED_TEXT: you don‚Äôt] [URL: http://www.forbes.com/sites/actiontrumpseverything/2013/02/09/you-have-to-spend-money-to-make-money-and-other-lies-people-tell-entrepreneurs/], but it certainly helps. Spending a little bit on advertising is a great way to get a boost of traffic, and if you‚Äôre getting that traffic from a legitimate source, it can convert into more than enough sales to turn a profit after the expense. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Below you‚Äôll find 6 easy, yet effective, ways to promote your online store through various avenues. You won‚Äôt know what works for you till you try it, and just like a physical location, customers won‚Äôt show up if they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre there. Let‚Äôs get started! 1. Offer Deals on a Regular Basis Most online marketplaces will give you the option to hold sales and/or use promo codes to help entice shoppers. Be sure to do this on a regular basis. From [LINKED_TEXT: taking ] [URL: https://blog.scottsmarketplace.com/marketing-ideas/]advantage of holiday shopping (get 15% off for Father‚Äôs Day, 31% off for Halloween, 50% off of select items on Black Friday, etc.) to simply offering great deals for no reason at all, this will help ensure you have regular web traffic. 2. Use Email Marketing to Remind Customers to Shop An example of a Scott‚Äôs Marketplace email that features our online sellers‚Äô products. When you first open your web store, you‚Äôll want to send out an email announcing it to your database. Make sure it links directly from the email to your store. Once you‚Äôve done this, start sending out weekly (if possible) newsletters that highlight your products with great images and persuasive, yet succinct, content that links directly to each product for easy purchasing. When you have sales, be sure to announce and promote them via email so customers can take advantage of your exclusive pricing right away. MailChimp is a free, easy-to-use option for small business owners. Some online marketplaces, including Scott‚Äôs Marketplace, promote their sellers‚Äô products to their massive database of shoppers through email marketing as well. And while the inclusions of your products isn‚Äôt guaranteed, you can up your chances by taking amazing photos of your products, and writing descriptive, typo-free product descriptions. 3. Start a Blog A blog is more than a great way to establish yourself as a leader in your industry, it‚Äôs also an indirect way to help promote your online shop. Include one relevant link back to your store in each blog post (either link the home page of your store or link directly to a product) and make sure each blog is informative and helpful.(Don‚Äôt forget to link any images back to your web store or a specific product too!) If the content isn‚Äôt strong, it‚Äôs not going to do you any good. Quality blog posts will help you grow your online business, however, so if you have the time, it‚Äôs a great project to invest in. 4. Contact Bloggers About Your Products Conduct an online search for whatever industry your products are in. (For example, if you create candles, you might look for lifestyle bloggers and/or bloggers who write about homemade goods) and then reach out to the ones with the largest following. Be sure to look for how many comments they receive and how large their following is on their social media accounts to gauge their popularity. When you contact them, tell them why you love their blog (be specific), then briefly explain why you feel your product would be a good fit for a review on their blog. Provide a sample of your product for free, and if you can afford it, offer to provide another sample for a giveaway. You‚Äôll get a review, a reader will get a free product, and you‚Äôll get priceless promotion direct to your target audience. 5. Start Guest Blogging Guest blogging can be a great way to reach a larger audience you wouldn‚Äôt have access to otherwise. Research who the top bloggers are in your industry (see above), read through their posts to see what topics they normally write about, and then contact them about guest blogging opportunities. Most bloggers will let you at least have a link to your store in your bio, but you possibly may also be able to get one in your content as well. Here‚Äôs a great blog post on how to get started. 6. Branch Out With Social Media Social media is essential if you want to promote your online shop effectively. But, as with anything, it takes effort and time to build followers. Depending on what you have time for (or if you can delegate tasks to anyone else to help you), you will want to check out the following sites to help market your store: (And continually try new sites to figure out what bests works for your business.)

The recession is right at our doorstep. For those who have heard this very few times, a recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity. Generally, two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth indicate recession, although more complex formulas are available. Is it too complicated? Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Finansopher] [URL: https://finansopher.com/recession-survival-guide-2023/] Take this way, the GDP growth rate of a country is negative for more than six months. It means the country has entered a recession. As you can see in this screenshot, the GDP growth rate of India, the USA, and Russia went down by -6.6%, -3.4%, and 2.7% in 2020. Any guesses about what was wrong in 2020 or before that? Of course, the pandemic. So, no demand, no supply, and no growth in GDP. Source: Google Search Now, look at the post-pandemic numbers. Crazy growth, isn‚Äôt it? Everything went back to normal: employment increased, demand increased, the market boomed, and the GDP growth rate increased too. Source: Google Search But the story could be different for some countries in 2023. So, you got to understand what a recession is, what GDP is, and how things could get messier to understand. Here are a few major causes for recession: Inflation: Source: Google Search Yes, inflation is one of the causes for recession, but in the current scenario, inflation is a big concern. The post-pandemic world witnessed inflation like never before. Things got worse in 2021. Car parts became more expensive then cars became more expensive. It got more serious when interest rates were increased too. This was the case for almost every product. And, for all those countries which entered or entering the recession, inflation is the big reason behind it. War, natural disaster or global epidemic: Source: Google Search The second cause behind this recession in 2022 is Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. It caused a lot of economic troubles, not only to affected nations but the whole world. And inflation picked up its momentum. Covid-19 Pandemic was a primary reason behind the recession in 2020, which can be cited as a global epidemic (Natural disaster) It occurs when speculation, market trends, or consumer confidence lead to a sudden increase in price. Investors buy it up, hoping for massive returns from the price increase. (More and more investors go for it) Speculations: When they begin to sell it off, supply exceeds demand, and prices drop, causing the bubble to burst. That was speculation. We discussed the causes for recession; now let‚Äôs move ahead with the effects of a downturn in India or any other country. If we talk about the US, it has had two consecutive quarters of negative growth. So, the US is in a recession, and the UK is in a recession. Most of India‚Äôs revenue comes through outsourcing. When countries like the US and UK are suffering from recession, we may get affected too. According to a report from The Hindu, India has no prospect of recession.

Later Christians believed all kinds of atrocities had occurred in pagan times, but there is little evidence of this:‚Äî Rome was a centre for gladiatorial contests and cruel blood sports, which the Greeks deplored, preferring athletics, art and theatre. The gladiatorial contests and Roman blood sports were eventually banned in the Christian empire, but Christians found new blood sports, such as bull-fighting, bear-baiting and cock-fighting. Unlike the Christians who came afterwards, the pagan leaders were generally religiously tolerant. There were some brief periods of official persecution of Christians, usually because the Christians appeared disloyal to the empire or brought about natural disasters by their lack of respect for the gods. In any case the extent of persecution appears to have been exaggerated by Christian tradition. Edward Gibbon says, in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire that the Christians of the fourth or fifth centuries created these exaggerated traditions in order to justify their own persecution of the pagans: The ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the same degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal which filled their own breasts against the heretics or the idolaters of their own times. It is true that the Greeks encouraged homosexual relationships with adolescent youths, but they despised homosexual relationships among grown men. The Romans looked down on homosexuality, but did not ban it. Today, we no longer generally regard homosexual relationships as immoral, but for those who do this would be one example of Christian moral superiority. Christianity came out of a Jewish milieu in which polygamy was permissible, but when it spread to the Greek-speaking territories of the empire and to Rome itself, it was forced to accept the pagan view that polygamy is immoral."},{"instruction":"What did you think of Donald Trump before he became President?","output":"an arrogant, rich prick"},{"instruction":"What is the future of the healthcare real estate industry?

I‚Äôm seeing this shift happen rapidly. We‚Äôre in an era of nationwide physician shortages and shrinking reimbursement for doctors. As administrative costs to deliver healthcare continues to increase, medical and wellness providers need more flexibility in the ways they work and the spaces they utilize.

I would have been in a supervisory position in their pilot training facility. I flew on Emirates a number of times while consulting on that project. I much preferred flying on Lufthansa. Emirates has a lot of glitz and little in-depth substance. Their captains make about 100 K where I was making 300 in the US as a captain. They fly around 90 hours a month compared to my 75. Their flights leave at 4:30 and 5 AM and the layovers are short. They short staff their flight crews. That means fewer pilots for relief on long haul trips. All that leads to flight crew fatigue. Is it any wonder that they are having a hard time hiring qualified experienced crews and want to start training their own. We should take notice of Air Ethiopia\`s experience doing that.

Though i am targetting this college last year it's closing rank for OBC-A category was 15353) (6) ESI JOKA (will surely get it & will opt for it) ESI JOKA is a Central Government College. I am telling this beforehand because some idiots think that it is a pvt college. I know I will get BMC/BSMC for sure but i don't want to go out of Kolkata. Now I am going to clear all your queries that u all might ask me in the comment box :‚Äî (Q) ESI JOKA is very costly? Ans: Yes I know about its fees structure. It's 50k per semester & my family is completely okay with it and moreover ESI JOKA pays a lot(as compared to what other state colleges of WB pays during Housestaffship) during its mandatory bond period of 1 year which is approximately 1L per month. So the amount that u will earn during your internship+bond period will more than nullify the amount u have paid during ur MBBS course. (Q) ESI JOKA has less patient load? Ans: Yes i know it's patient load is less than that of other colleges of WB as it's only open to ESI card holders though the Emergency is open to all. But in internship only basic things are taught & for that the college has enough patient load. I have my friends studying at MCK, SSKM, NRS who have completed their internship they themselves say that in internship only some basic things are taught and for that ESI patient load is enough. (Q) 1 year bond period in ESI JOKA üò®? Ans: Yes u have a 1 year mandatory bond period in ESI JOKA after internship. Now some might feel that bond period is equivalent to drop year. I want to ask them that are they sure that they will crack their PG entrance exam in their first attempt & that too with their dream branch? And if u are unable to crack PG in 1st attempt atleast you will be serving the corporation for which they will pay u a hefty amount and u also have an additional advantage of less patient load so u will get time for your PG Preparation too. Though in ESI JOKA there is a provision that if u clear ur PG in first attempt u can serve the corporation later provided u have to show them a 5L bank garuntee. Some pics of ESI JOKA :‚Äî Suggestions are welcome ‚ò∫Ô∏è Edit : This is what a fellow quoran and an intern student of MCK has to say about ESI JOKA :‚Äî"},{"instruction":"Why does Modi celebrate Deepavali every year with the Indian Army, even though India is a secular country, and he does not celebrate other religious festivals?","output":"Our Current Prime Minister is a real Aam Admi, may be he has a lot power now but we tend to forget who he was and from where he came to this position. The real life struggle always count to understand and feel others problems. Being a politician he need to behave in certain way and he does that brilliantly. His name was tarnished by many who never wanted him as their competitor because they know‚Äôs what can happen if he comes to the power. We can now see a great marketing professional, a superb administrator and a seasoned politician balancing all acts together with control and passion. He is not only connected to the best entrepreneurs of the world, but also connected to every sect and society of india and even outside india. We will focus his Muslim friendly attitude and reasons why muslims should feel anything bad about him, which is propagated by people who don‚Äôt want growth but need only filthy promotion and ways to stop growth of the country. Modi Ji in Saudi Arabia With Muslim Friends in Mosque The biggest thing that happened with his rising to power is building of more international friends starting from Muslim countries to Buddhist to Secular to Christian countries. He is even has friend in communist ruled china, it‚Äôs important we understand the meaning and importance of having more quality friend than enemy‚Äôs around you, and that‚Äôs what he did. Let‚Äôs see Our Prime Minister how weak he was when he started his political life and where he was. Narendra Modi as a Sadhu : Gradually moving to Politics : Just Entered Full Scale Politics and faced with India‚Äôs two biggest historic events one is Godhra Riot and then Bhuj Earthquake, it‚Äôs like a fresher given the duty to run Microsoft, how would he feel and what he can do? After all he is a human we must never forget that and he could also quit from all these chaos, he don‚Äôt even have family, why would he work so hard, for what he will pile money, but he never quit and that is commendable? IN THE BURNT TRAIN AT GODHRA WITH OUR EX PRIME MINISTER SHREE ATAL BIHARI VAJPAYEE REQUESTING TO MAINTAIN PEACE AND HARMONY DURING RIOTS NOW SEE THIS VIDEO, HERE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW HE WAS MALIGNED In India Today Conclave It is easy to malign a person with political power but if he has the will power he can come out of it, that‚Äôs what he has proved. Now a very simple thing was made an issue where he seemingly just accepted one gift from a muslim person as it was a public meeting not all like a muslim cap. And that was made an issue, just think what is politics. And listen to his clarification.

Dress conservatively - Bhutan is a conservative country and it is best to dress modestly, especially when visiting temples and monasteries. 2. Be aware of the altitude - Bhutan is a landlocked country located high up in the Himalayas. The capital city of Thimphu is at an altitude of 2,400 metres (8,000 feet), so be prepared for some breathlessness when you first arrive. Drink plenty of fluids and take it easy for the first few days until you get used to the thin air. 3. Learn some basic Dzongkha - Dzongkha is the national language of Bhutan and although English is widely spoken, learning a few basic phrases will help you get by and endear you to the locals. 4. Bring cash - There are no ATMs in Bhutan and credit cards are not widely accepted, so make sure you bring enough cash to last you throughout your trip. US dollars are the preferred currency. 5. Be respectful - Bhutanese culture is based on Buddhism and Tibetan traditions, so show respect when visiting religious sites or when interacting with locals. Finally, remember that Bhutan is a cash-only country, so make sure you have enough cash with you to cover all expenses during your stay."},{"instruction":"Why did Roger Waters seek to legally dissolve Pink Floyd back in the early ‚Äô80s? He was the bass player, colead singer & main songwriter of the band and he‚Äôs not the whole band itself (Syd Barrett was the founder of the band).","output":"OK, first of saying Syd Barrett was the founder of the band is kind of bullshit. When Syd got to London Roger, Nick and Rick were already in a band with Bob Klose and some back up singers and Syd got into one of the incarnations of that band and then later renamed it to The Pink Floyd, but the nucleus of the band was started before Syd Barrett got into the picture. Anyhow, now that that‚Äôs out of my system: well, you have to remember what Roger saw in 1987 when he initially made that claim. He knew that the internals of the band were no longer sound. Rick Wright had been forced out during the Wall sessions, Mason had been burned out to the point where he couldn‚Äôt even play on most of the Wall or the Final Cut, Gilmour really wasn‚Äôt stepping up and writing a whole lot (though he did solo albums in 1979 and 1984). As Roger saw it in the mid and late 80s, Pink Floyd without him was a creatively spent force of people who didn‚Äôt have the drive to put in the work necessary to do anything of merit. There‚Äôs a story that in either late 86 or early 87 Roger and his wife at the time, Caroline, went to see David aboard his houseboat Astoria, to see if there was anything worth salvaging between them professionally or possibly even personally. To my knowledge nobody‚Äôs ever talked about the details of that meeting, but what is known is that within a few months of that Roger was advised through the publishing company that he was still partial owner of that an account had been set up to accept the proceeds of a future Pink Floyd album and a future Pink Floyd tour. To say he was livid was an understatement. Bob Ezrin had previously committed to producing Rogers sophomore release, Radio KAOS, but all of a sudden Ezrin ducked out to produce the new Floyd album. Then he started getting reports from the record company, as they were both under the same banner at that point. Reports that they were gathering an army of ghost writers and musicians to cobble the record together. Reports that executives listened to bits of the new album and complained that it didn‚Äôt ‚Äòsound Pink Floyd enough‚Äô and they were going back into the studio to tweak it. Roger had put in 20 years of his life into building Pink Floyd into something worthwhile. The idea that they were running from solo careers that failed to take off to hide under the banner of the Pink Floyd and using, what he at least saw as, duplicitous tactics to make it more palatable pissed him off. It pissed him off so much he got petty and filed an injunction to try and stop them. Roger fundamentally lost not because of some moral reason or because he didn‚Äôt contribute enough or anything like that. Roger lost because as the British courts saw it, Pink Floyd was a brand, like a corporation and the idea that a person wanted to take a very valuable piece of property and retire it while others wanted to use it for gain‚Ä¶ they could not side with him. Roger was offered, basically, the ability to go before the English courts and fight to use the name Pink Floyd to tour and release albums for himself, but he didn‚Äôt want that for himself anymore than he wanted it for the others, so don‚Äôt believe the bullshit some people try and peddle out there that Roger Waters sanctimoniously believed that he was Pink Floyd alone, because he had a golden opportunity to try and use that strategy but he refused to. To him Pink Floyd was the combination and he had no interest in continuing down a path with the other members that he had felt he was carrying for nearly a decade at that point. Roger now concedes that he was in error with all of it. He left Pink Floyd because he had diverged enough from the others that he needed to get out of the umbrella of the band and he need to go it alone. He understands now that while that was his decision, he cannot force other people to doing likewise, as he tried to do an 87. He accepts now he was wrong in trying to stop them. There‚Äôs a part of me that believes that recognition was helped when he finally got success as a solo artist in the late 90s and early 2000s and the fact that, fundamentally, all the reformed Pink Floyd did was release two albums and go on two tours (the third album wasn‚Äôt released until after he had admitted he was wrong). It wasn‚Äôt like they had a massive body of work after he had left."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to remit money from Japan to India?","output":"Japan doesn't have many options to send money to India as compared to US or UK,.

Volatile sulfur compounds may also play a role in periodontal disease affecting the integrity of the tissue barrier, allowing endotoxins (a part of bacteria) to produce periodontal destruction, endotoxemia (endotoxins in the blood), and bacteremia (bacteria in the blood).

Nevertheless, it's worthwhile to consider both the personal and professional advantages of learning something new. So, this guide is our attempt to respond to the inquiry, \\"What should I learn?\\" While some of the abilities will be more advantageous for particular vocations than others, all of them will be to your advantage. Web programming is a highly valuable talent to master if you're so inclined, even though I don't believe everyone should code. You can obviously use it to earn money from a job or from freelancing. But it also makes creating and promoting your projects online more simple. Also, it can be quite exciting and fun. Ultimately, it's an excellent entry point into other, more complex, programming languages. An effective tool for showing your work and captivating potential employers is a website. It requires more work than a resume to create, but we believe it will improve your job prospects. Also, you will learn many useful skills along the way, including how to purchase a domain, manage a website with WordPress, and even write your own blog posts. Networking has an ultimate impact at every stage of your life. It can lead to all kinds of opportunities that pure talent alone cannot. Also, the connections you build through networking can improve your quality of life and result in friendships outside of the office. In fact, we like to think of it as establishing friends rather than networking. Several of those will be close pals who have similar employment goals to yours and may even be able to boost your career. Yet relationships come first, followed by career advantages. How many of us who work for businesses actually know how they operate? Of course, you comprehend the aspects of the company that are relevant to your job responsibilities, but how well-versed are you in HR or accounting? Even if you're unlikely to be involved in every facet of your company's operations, it's nevertheless helpful to comprehend how everything fits together. You'll be able to cooperate with other team members more successfully and communicate more clearly in meetings with your employer thanks to it. Also, knowing it will be helpful if you ever decide to launch your own company.

However, gamers and developers are becoming more concerned about the possible drawbacks of these constantly expanding virtual worlds. One of the biggest problems is the possibility that when users go off the usual route, open worlds would seem too big and lifeless, devoid of interesting material or compelling experiences. This issue may be most noticeable in expansive open-world games where exploring often results in finding nothing of note. The difficulty for developers is finding the ideal balance between the scope of the environment and the material it gives. Although some players enjoy the feeling of independence and the opportunity to explore vast areas, others find the size of these games intimidating or even annoying. To keep players from becoming lost or bored in the open world, it is crucial to provide captivating and immersive experiences. Some game producers have made their games more complex and bigger in an effort to give lengthy playtimes in order to support the expensive cost of their games. This could compromise the integrity of the tale and the storytelling itself. To guarantee that players have a pleasurable and rewarding experience, it is essential to strike the correct balance between a gripping plot and a fascinating universe. Players look for a compelling story that can capture their attention and provide them chances for exploration and discovery. Additionally, there is a worry that open-world games are getting too complicated. The postponement of much anticipated games like Cyberpunk 2077 has raised questions about whether game complexity is lowering overall quality. Complexity may provide depth and difficulty, but it can also cause technological problems, overbearing gaming mechanisms, and a general lack of refinement. To guarantee that games continue to be pleasant for a variety of players, it is crucial to strike a balance between complexity and accessibility. Indeed, as technology has advanced throughout time, the scale and breadth of open-world video games have increased. These games are becoming bigger, which requires careful evaluation of any possible negative effects. In order to prevent the open world from seeming barren and devoid of interesting stuff, developers must carefully limit its scale. It's also essential to strike a balance between the game's duration and a gripping narrative to keep players interested. Additionally, achieving the ideal amount of intricacy without tiring out players is crucial for developing pleasant and approachable experiences. Developers may continue to produce open-world games that enthrall gamers without becoming out of control by solving these issues.

But what about women, especially those with low testosterone? Understanding the unique physiology of women can lead to effective strategies for muscle development, even with lower testosterone levels. For women, building muscle is primarily about consistent strength training, adequate protein intake, and a balanced diet. While testosterone does play a role in muscle growth, it's not the only factor at play. Therefore, even if you have low testosterone levels, you can still build muscle. Strength training is crucial. Regular resistance exercises, like weightlifting, stimulate muscle protein synthesis. This process repairs and strengthens the muscle fibers that were broken down during your workout, leading to muscle growth. Moreover, a diet rich in protein provides the necessary building blocks for this muscle repair and growth. The recommended dietary allowance for protein is 46 grams per day for women, but if you're regularly strength training, you may need more to support muscle growth. Balanced nutrition doesn't stop with protein. Your body needs a variety of nutrients to function optimally and build muscle, including healthy fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Also, don't forget the importance of recovery. Rest days and good sleep are essential for muscle growth and repair. Without proper recovery time, your muscle-building efforts might be counterproductive. For women with low testosterone who are struggling to build muscle, supplementation can be a game-changer. While testosterone boosters are often marketed towards men, certain supplements can safely and effectively support muscle growth in women. Testosil‚Ñ¢, is tailored specifically for women seeking to enhance their muscle growth. Testosil‚Ñ¢ is packed with essential amino acids and other natural ingredients that support protein synthesis and muscle recovery, making it an excellent adjunct to your workout and nutrition regimen. Though testosterone levels can influence muscle growth, it's far from the whole story. With consistent strength training, adequate protein intake, balanced nutrition, and strategic supplementation with products like Testosil‚Ñ¢, women can effectively build muscle, even if their testosterone levels are lower. Ready to take your fitness journey to the next level? Discover the benefits of Testosil‚Ñ¢ and our comprehensive range of health and fitness supplements on our website at [LINKED_TEXT: https://tiny.youthregain.com/Quora1] [URL: https://tiny.youthregain.com/Quora1]Let's unlock your strength potential together."},{"instruction":"What‚Äôs your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","output":"Don‚Äôt follow anything anybody says, just live your life dude. Even if you fail, get hurt or whatever, you‚Äôre always learning something."},{"instruction":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter. Am I fired, or did I quit?","output":"You are fried."},{"instruction":"Do expensive guitar pickups make a difference?","output":"Different pickups make a difference. Pickups make more difference than strings and much more difference than the wood your instrument is made from. Changing pickups can completely transform the sound. It‚Äôs not about price though, it‚Äôs about how well those particular pickups suit the guitar, strings, and player. You may well find that different pickups improve your guitar. They might even be cheaper pickups, if the ones in it are a poor match‚Ä¶ and yet, those might be awesome for someone else in a different guitar. So‚Ä¶ pay attention to the reviews of particular pickups, listen to sound demos of them (especially if you can find one where they are using a similar instrument to yours), and pick based on sound not price. All of this applies just as much to bass pickups too."},{"instruction":"w is a kratom high different from an opiate high?","output":"Kratom contains alkaloids that activate the same opioid receptors as morphine, but they are structurally different. In general, the effects of kratom are more stimulating than those of opiates. The most important difference is that kratom does not seem to cause respiratory depression, which is the leading cause of death from opioid overdoses. Kratom also has a much lower addiction potential than opiates."},{"instruction":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a nongeared twowheeler over a geared one?","output":"Advantages: [LINKED_TEXT: 1. ] [URL: http://1.no/]No clutch adjustment required. Because there is no clutch cable . 2. No need to change gears. Because there is no gear shifter. 3. Petrol can't be stolen atleast its cumbersome to do so on a scooter or if it is a motorcycle like africa twin again same as above as its cumbersome or nearly impossible for a layman to get to the fuel outlet. 4. Old school front and rear lever brake setup in scooters and mostly nowadays it comes with cbs and in some we get abs so that is even more perfect to brake both brakes at the same time using just levers and not footpedal. In gear less motorcycles again no clutch lever and gear shifter so just the right hand and right leg coordination is also a good combo for perfect braking because our subconscious mind doesnt have to bother about clutch and gears and all tht. 5. Beltdrive in scooters lasts much longer than conventional chain type in motorcycles. Its enclosed and its very cheap to buy too. 6. Scooters can take more luggage without much effort like tying and all that.. Underseat storage is like u can lock things up and front floorboard can take anythin from gas cylinders to water cans(20 litres) to anythin.. If u have a backpack keep em between ur legs in the floor board and ride without worries and its got locky docks too. 7. If it rains just open the seat keep mobilephone purse etc inside it close the seat and ride. As simple as tht. Storage is the main advantage. Disadvantages: Scooters are fun but not so much like on a motorcycle. Scooters can take u places but as in india except 2 or 3 scooters others cant cross 90 kmph. so cruising and doing long distance touring is not possible unless you have patience to tour on much lower average speeds. Exception africa twin and such gearless motorcycles.Mileage is not that great comparing similar cc motorcycles.For any tuning of carb, replacement of cables etc its very tiring as its not simple to access like on a motorcycle. Must remove plenty of bolts here n thr and lift the whole rear part and do lil stuffs.Not very torquey. And if stuck in a pothole motorcycles can be switched to a lower gear and with help of clutch can be taken out of the situation. Here all we can do is rev and hope we get out.and with pillion in that situation, yeah both can get off the scooter anytime and push it out. Same goes with heavy pillion rides but on a motorcycle speedy pickup and gear changin on tight rpm and time can make ride interesting but in scooters rev or brake thats it.Not fun as geared motorcycle.Very dangerous on a hill station ride especially downhill.. No proper engine braking, no gears so cant downshift for more engine braking and all we can depend on are brakes and if thats out of shape or overheated then its a one way journey upward üíØüëç"},{"instruction":"Where can I find reliable CCTV manufacturers?","output":"if you want high-quality CCTV manufacturers directories of contractors and dealers. you can visit here.

There are a variety of methods one can use to reduce face fat, including diet and exercise, facial exercises, and even some lifestyle changes. 1. Diet and Exercise: Eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise are essential components of reducing face fat. Eating a diet that is high in complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats will help to reduce overall body fat, including facial fat. Additionally, engaging in at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise five times per week will help to burn calories and melt away fat. 2. Facial Exercises: There are a variety of facial exercises that can be used to help reduce face fat. These exercises include things like puckering your lips and making exaggerated facial expressions, or simply massaging the facial muscles in a circular motion. Doing these facial exercises for five to ten minutes each day will help to tone and tighten the facial muscles, which can reduce the appearance of fat in the face. 3. Lifestyle Changes: Making a few small lifestyle changes can also help to reduce face fat. Drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary beverages and processed foods will help to reduce overall body fat, including fat in the face. Additionally, reducing stress and getting adequate rest will also help to reduce facial fat. 4. Skin Care: Taking care of your skin is also important when it comes to reducing face fat. Using a good facial cleanser and moisturizer will help to keep the skin healthy and hydrated, which can help to reduce the appearance of facial fat. Additionally, using a good sunscreen can help to protect the skin from sun damage, which can also help to reduce facial fat. By making a few changes to your diet and lifestyle, and incorporating some facial exercises and skin care, you can reduce face fat and achieve a more sculpted and toned facial appearance. With a little bit of dedication and effort, you can reduce face fat and be proud of the results. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

It depends what you mean by ‚Äúangle‚Äù. If you mean geometrically as a pair of lines that meet at a point then I think you can. If you just mean that you know the magnitudes of the angles then I doubt it. Let‚Äôs consider knowing only the magnitudes of the projected angles. Working forwards from two unit vectors, [math](a_1,a_2,a_3)[/math] and [math](b_1,b_2,b_3)[/math] there are four independent coordinates. The projections on the [math]xy[/math] plane are [math](a_1,a_2,0)[/math] and [math](b_1,b_2,0)[/math] and have dot product [math]frac{a_1b_1+a_2b_2}{sqrt{(a_1^2+a_^2)(b_1^2+b_^2)}}[/math]. Similarly we can find the other two dot products. These represent the cosines of the projected angles. This gives three equations for the four unknowns. That‚Äôs not enough to solve for [math]a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2[/math]. Maybe it is possible to find the dot product [math]a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3[/math] without finding the individual coordinates, But I doubt it. If you know the angles in the geometrical sense then imagine a drawing of them in orthographic projection, the image on the [math]xy[/math] plane being the plan, the image on the [math]yz[/math] plane being the front elevation and the image on the [math]xz[/math] plane being the side elevation. The point of intersection of the lines will be aligned horizontally on the elevations and vertically on the front elevation and plan. horizontal and vertical lines to the axes joined by a quadrant of a circle completes the alignment. Then you can draw similar lines to mark corresponding points on the elevations and plan. I‚Äôm not sure that you can determine which line on the elevations corresponds to a point on one of the lines in the plan, but I don‚Äôt think it matters. If you can then you can take a point on each line. Then the length of the line joining them can be calculated using Pythagoras‚Äôs theorem. And similarly you can find the other sides of a triangle. The cosine rule will complete the calculation."},{"instruction":"Why are Tempurpedic beds so expensive?","output":"In terms of brand reliability - Sleepwell >= Springtek > Kurlon > Wakefit = Peps > Nilkamal > Solimo >= Centuary Mattress In terms of comfort - Memory Foam > Pocket Spring > PU Foam >= Bonnell Spring > Coir In terms of useful life - Pocket Spring = Memory Foam > PU Foam > Bonnell Spring > Coir Well, keeping in consideration the extensive research that made me take the [LINKED_TEXT: buying decision] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] of a mattress for my bed just a few hours ago, I would state that when it comes to buying a mattress, one of the most crucial factors that influences the decision of purchase is the materials used in its fabrication - Build of the Mattress Mattresses are fabricated in primarily three configurations - Coir based, Spring based and Foam based. Among them, coir based mattresses are fabricated using the fibers from outer husk of a coconut. Due to their organic nature, they are very well suited for the people who are allergic to synthetic substances. The greatest advantage of such mattresses is that they are very well ventilated and thus provide enhanced hygroscopic properties, i.e., they impart great air circulation and moisture absorption characteristics. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user‚Äôs body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. On the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses. While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‚Äòbouncy‚Äô than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for.

Pretty much everyone knows about the physical aspects. Problems with buying clothes, hygiene issues, trouble getting around; feet, knee and hip pain, fear of falling, diabetes, tired all the time, trouble fitting in seats etc... The mental aspect deals with how you feel being fat as well as what you think about that keeps you fat. Emotionally, it hurts when people stare at you while you are eating. It's depressing to look in the mirror or to see yourself in pictures. It's frustrating if you used to be a normal size and once you are fat, you can no longer do the things that used to make you happy. With every bite you are afraid that you are shortening your lifespan. What you think about has a lot to do with how long you have been obese. Someone who was chubby as a child and just kept gaining has never known life without having a weight problem. If their entire family is also overweight they might think that it is normal and be in a state of denial about how much they are damaging their body. They have probably tried many diets, but as soon as it becomes too uncomfortable they give up. After being able to eat whatever they want, year after year, it can be close to impossible for them to figure out why they got fat in the first place and how to stop the cycle. Thoughts can involve self loathing, excuses, blame, and the assumption that they are unable to change. Someone who was a normal size growing up, who gained weight through pregnancy, depression, an eating disorder, or a traumatic event, will think differently about their weight. Losing weight might come easily, but keeping it off will be the challenge. They know what it is like to be accepted by society and as they gain more weight and that acceptance goes away, they begin to feel self hatred. They will remember what it was like to run up a flight of stairs. How it felt to be thought of as attractive. Thoughts can be a lot about remembering how life used to be and desperately wanting to return to that life. Watching shows like Biggest Loser can give you an idea of the obstacles that people with obesity have to deal with, but the shows don't really let you know what the people are thinking about inside. Sometimes it seems like every hour, every day revolves around food. What to eat, guilt about eating, guilt about going off a diet, trying to get up the motivation to start another diet. Thinking that life would be just perfect if only you were skinny. Trying to exercise, giving up on exercise because it hurts too much. Fear of running into someone you used to know that knew the skinnier you. Hiding from the camera. Trying to explain to the doctor why the number is going up instead of going down. Being aware that your children are embarrassed to be seen with you. Praying that your spouse still loves you and finds you attractive even though you look nothing now like you did when you married. There are as many excuses, thoughts, feelings and wishes as there are people who are obese.

One formula is to add your parent‚Äôs heights together & add 5‚Ä≥ for males (deduct 5‚Ä≥ for females) then divide by 2 and that is your approx. height. Though there are many exceptions because other factors come in to play‚Ä¶. Gender ‚Äì Males can grow until around 20/21 and Females growth usually finishes around 2 years after their periods begin and normally finish around 14 or 15 (though some say up to 16/17) Environment - social setting, culture and climate have some bearing but the % varies. Hormones ‚Äì HGH ‚Äì Human Growth Hormone secreted in the Pituitary gland within the Brain and that is what drives your growth Food Too much Fat affects the release of HGH ‚Äì so try to keep you Fat consumption down Eat foods rich in Proteins, calcium for bone strength, vitamins and mineral, phosphorous and magnesium Don‚Äôt skip meals ‚Äì your body needs regular fuel to grow Foods to stimulate the Pituitary Gland are:- Guava, turnip, carrots, spinach, grapes. Sleep Get plenty of sleep ‚Äì 8 hours is ideal for during sleep HGH is secreted Water - Drink a glass of water when you get up in the morning and 4 ‚Äì 6 litres of water a day ‚Äì it aids digestion and absorption of foods and vitamins. Breathing - Practice breathing properly and deeply for that promotes blood flow and stimulate HGH Physical activity stimulates the gain of HGH ‚Äì sport/aerobic exercise helps blood circulation and HGH. It stretches the body and strengthens the spine and legs and helps growth Posture - Stand tall and don‚Äôt slouch and maintain good posture and don‚Äôt crouch in bed - lie straight for it helps the spine So, whatever your height is at the moment the above suggestions will help you reach your optimal height. You may also be interested in the following information ‚Äì What are Growth Plates The growth plate, also known as the epiphyseal plate or physis, is the area of growing tissue near the end of the long bones in children and adolescents. Each long bone has at least two growth plates: one at each end. The growth plate determines the future length and shape of the mature bone. What age does your growth plates close? The age at which most men's epiphyseal plates (also known as growth plates) close is variable. In nearly all cases, a man's epiphyseal plates will close at a later age than a woman's. This always occurs after the end of the final growth spurt. This means that this can occur anytime between the ages of 16 and 21. What causes your growth plates to close? Thyroid hormone is important for growth because it promotes growth hormone synthesis. Gonadal steroids (estrogen and testosterone), whose secretion increases at puberty, initially promote growth by increasing GH secretion, and then subsequently cause growth to end by causing the closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. Can you grow after growth plates close? Some Medical Conditions may cause an Adult's height to increase. Although most adults won't grow taller after age 18 to 20, there are exceptions to this rule. Eg. the closure of the growth plates may be delayed in some individuals.

In fact, it is a strange exchange every 4 electrons: 8 = 2 x 1 at the poles + 2 x 3 at endcap same latitude 9 = 0 x 1 at the poles + 2 x 3 at endcap same latitude 10 - become 2 x 5 - old subshell-d with 0 at the pole, and 0 in subshell-0 and 0 in the transitional equatorial up-to-3 subshell. 11 - 2 x 1 at the poles + 2 x 3 at endcap same latitude + 3 at the equator 12 = 2 x 1 at the poles + 0 x 3 at endcap + 0 at equator + 2 x 5 at upper latitude of subshell-d It is a weird progression that generates you +2 when the 2x 1 at the poles is the best change when you would think +3. 5 This is not the textbook answer, and probably the hottest debate in chemistry today.

With all this rage and anger why doesn't he thrive on destroying things like DC's Doomsday, instead of wanting to be left alone?","output":"The answer to your question is easy. It's because The version of The Hulk you speak of is not evil. The Hulk does not thrive on conquest, but he lives his life on what he thinks is right and what he thinks is wrong. If the Hulk was attacked by Doomsday he would engage him up to the point of Doomsday's defeat, but most likely, he would not even seek to kill him, unless he had no other choice. At least the version of The Hulk you are speaking of is like this.

I planned to retire at 55 years old with 33 years of service. But at 50 I was fired from my job. They didnt state a reason and just said I was an ‚Äòat will‚Äô employee and they were ending my employment relationship, after 28 years. At the time I had been married 30 years and our children were grown and gone. I appealed the termination and lost. I hired an attorney began a lawsuit and was doing all I could to redeem myself. I felt embarrased and betrayed. Aditionally the economy at that time had plunged and several realestate investments I had made over the years had tanked. While focused on all that, I was blindsided by my wife when she asked for a divorce. That took all the fight out of me.. I was a beaten man at 50.. Suffering from anxiety and depression, over weight, unhealthy and feeling completely defeated and alone. I left a power of attorney for my wife to have her divorce, boarded a plane and flew to Central America hoping to some how leave a failed life behind and start over again. Shortly after I was notified that the divorce was finalized I remarried here to an unknown lat√≠na.,15 years my younger. It was a contract marriage so that I could obtain a visa as I had no income and didnt yet qualify for retirement. She doesnt speak english and I knew very little spanish. Fast forward. Now Im 61 years old. This photo is me now on the steps of our home with my step daughter on my arm, giving here away in marriage. The very dark skinned woman in the silver dress at the top of the stairs is her mother, my beautiful wife. We are still married after all these years. Together we have built a large business and have a good, solid income. In the undisputed divorce, my ex got half my retirement. Doesnt matter much though. Here a little money goes a long way. We have a hacienda with cattle and cacao plants, a large home in the City and a beach front home a couple of hours away. Life here is relaxed and slow, low stress and very little anxiety. Good, inexpensive, fresh vegatibles an seafood. Im much healthier and much younger looking and feeling than when I left the US all those years ago. I love my wife, and I love the life weve built together. Retirement, relationships, and life in general seldom go as planned, and thats okay. Life is a struggle and its that struggle that keeps us feeling alive. Wouldnt have it any other way."},{"instruction":"What is ‡§§‡§æ‡§ú‡§Æ‡§π‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§®‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç?","output":"Yamuna"},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

In case, we lose the job, we don't have any backup funds to take care of the in-between period. Second biggest reason is the lack of reality. We believe in showing off to the world rather than living a real true life. We believe in showing off healthy food to the world while we munch on junk all the time. We believe in showing off the car that we bought while we are struggling with our hefty EMIs. We believe in showing off a happy relationship while we are struggling to keep things going.

What we called today as a Hinduism is not one belief it is mixture of various philosophies you will see bhakti movement Sikh teaching and teaching of Jesus Christ is quite similar all 3 belief in bhakti as a means of salvation. If you will study Vedanta you will understand that both buddhist and Jainism are very similar to it. Even Sufism in Islam have many similarities with bhakti moment. So Hinduism is actually diffrent ways to attain mukti or nirvana. That is why we say some time hinduism as eternal religion. And talk about scriptures Hinduism has no specific scriptures krishna devotes read Geeta ram devotees read Ramayana Devi devotees read Devi Sutra Shiva devotees read shiv Sutra some read Upanishads and some Vedas etc etc.dr bhimrao ambedkar hated caste system and he did nothing wrong because it was one of the worst discrimination in the history of mankind. Dr br ambedkar was inspired by advaita Vedanta and also bhakti saint like gajanan maharaj sai baba sant gadge maharaj kabir ramanuja and more. At the initial stage Dr bhim rao ambedkar tried to revive Hinduism but it was become impossible because Brahmin were not letting go their pride. If you read Geeta Upanishads you will never ever see caste system in it. Manusmriti is third class scripture it was written by some stupid sage which make Brahmin feel superior of themselves. Dr br ambedkar was right firing Manusmriti. Manusmriti is not yogic book it is book which may be good at that time but as a time passes situation changes now this book is completely waste. Dr br ambedkar doesn't hate Hinduism he has told many times while writing commentaries on books like Geeta he hate caste system. caste system was not superior inferior if was some another but problem start when people start to take it as a superior inferior.

The most obvious practical difference is the cost of faster network speeds. A wired Cat6-based network will support up to 10Gbs. Getting that kind of bandwidth from a wireless network needs huge investment and satellite-grade equipment at both ends. One end, in fact is usually a satellite. Then there‚Äôs security. Wireless is a broadcast medium which means any aerial in the general vicinity can pick up the signal, even narrow band transmissions are susceptible to this, whereas you need physical access to a wired network to do the equivalent. Unless you‚Äôre the NSA or one of their peers and are able to compromise the software in the network infrastructure of course. It‚Äôs fairly easy to shield a wired network from interference by adding shielding in some form, but not really practical for wireless. Even frequency hopping isn‚Äôt a guaranteed solution. Just a few thoughts which may not be the kind of thing you‚Äôre looking for of course."},{"instruction":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?","output":"Intraday trading means buying and selling in the same day. It may be either buying first or short selling. Normally intraday traders book profit in small margins. People are making profit by repeated trades or by trading large quantities. One thing to be mentioned here is intraday trading is high risk involved. The Golden rule of intraday trade is ride with the trend. Hence the first step to make profit in intraday trade is to identify the stock. Intraday charts are the best way to identify stocks for trading intraday. Also one should make a good home work before entering in intraday trade. Home work means, study the historical charts and find out the upward or downward moving stocks. Then see the previous days intraday chart. Find out the support and resistance levels. The better strategy will be buy at previous days support level and short at previous days resistance levels. Also shorting below support level and buying above resistance level are good ideas. Keeping stop loss is very important for intraday trade. Otherwise one will loose heavily. Where to keep stop loss is a very important question. Again previous days intraday charts will help. If one shorted in a stock, keep stop loss at previous days high or days high. Also if bought, keep stop loss at previous days lows, or days lows. Another thing to remember is keep trailing stop loss and revise stop loss when one is in profit. Instead of booking profit, one can keep stop loss for profit and can revise according to upward movement. Normally this will help a lot in intraday trade. The two things to avoid in stock market and particularly in intraday trade is panic and greedy. When one enters in a trade and goes in opposite direction, don‚Äôt be panic. Wait some time, keep strict stop loss. If stop loss triggers, don‚Äôt enter again. Wait some time and relax, watch the market trend and enter in some other stocks. Another thing to avoid is greediness. Some people will not book profit and wait for more and more profit. But such people will end up in loss only. In intraday trade book profit in every highs. Wait for a dip and enter again if trend sustains. The best time to enter for intraday trade is after 20 to 30 minutes when the market opens. Some people will jump in the market at the opening bell itself. It is risky always. Watch the market in the early trades and find out the trend. First enter in some small quantity, say 25% of the quantity one is intended to buy. Then buy more in the next 10 to 15 minutes. The trend observed is intraday trading is stocks will shoot up till after 45 to 1 hour when the market opens. This is the best time to book profit. Once booked profit in a particular stock, better wait some time and watch the next movement and enter accordingly.

I think so. Even today, I'm shocked and appalled by it. Hardly. In fact, that you seem to be disparaging Carney‚Äôs role in the film is a strong indicator that you have never seen it. It‚Äôs every bit as strong as Pacino‚Äôs and Nicholson‚Äôs and it's actually more subtly done than the latter‚Äôs. Harry and Tonto is an underappreciated classic and Art Carney never really received his due as an actor of no small amount talent.

Generally speaking, iron has more than twice as much magnesium as calcium by weight (with roughly 75 mg of magnesium per 100 g compared to only 30 mg of calcium). Iron is an important mineral that plays a key role in many bodily functions, such as energy production and formation of red blood cells. It also plays a role in strengthening bones, teeth and muscles. By contrast, calcium is mostly known for its role in maintaining strong bones and teeth, but it also helps with muscle contraction and nerve transmission. So while iron has more magnesium, both minerals are essential for your health."},{"instruction":"w badly damaged is Whole Foods' brand in Canada after they attempted to ban their Canadian employees from wearing Remembrance Day poppies?","output":"‚ÄúHow badly damaged is Whole Foods' brand in Canada after they attempted to ban their Canadian employees from wearing Remembrance Day poppies?‚Äù Canadians are generally fairly easy-going and forgiving and will overlook many transgressions (as long as they don‚Äôt become a habit). That being said I think Whole Foods made a major error in banning Remembrance Day poppies for their staff. I get why they did this. They want to keep a uniformity in what their people wear on duty so that they can be easily identified by customers and they also want to avoid falling into the problems that some other companies have been ensnared in such as Chick-fil-A, Hobby Lobby and others have lost business. However, in Canada and most other Commonwealth countries Remembrance Day isn‚Äôt a political or social cause. It‚Äôs viewed with the same reverence that Americans see their flag and the British view their Queen. I can remember Remembrance Day services way back to when I was in public school. I remember going to Ottawa one year and watching Remembrance Day services at the Cenotaph. I remember going to Camp-X and seeing CSIS officers in uniform honouring their fallen comrades. I‚Äôve watched the Mynarski Lancaster ([LINKED_TEXT: Andrew Mynarski - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mynarski]) do a flyby on Remembrance Day.

I‚Äôve worn a poppy every Remembrance Day since I was old enough to know what it stood for. I‚Äôve often printed my father‚Äôs name and squadron number on the front of the poppy when I left it behind on the statue where the services are held. And often, I‚Äôve had to wipe tears from my eyes when I think of all those memories. I think poppies are intensely important to Canadians (at least those of us born in Canada) and for Whole Foods to ban them from employees was a huge mistake. The poppy in Canada is not a ‚Äòcause‚Äô. It‚Äôs part of our national heritage. But I‚Äôve seen this happen before with American subsidiaries in Canada. They come to a foreign country and think that they know everything, and that everything they do is the right way to do it, that they can do no wrong. I used to work for one American company who put big US flags on their products. They had ‚ÄòPresident‚Äôs Day‚Äô or ‚Äò4th of July‚Äô sales and then couldn‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt generate much interest. They didn‚Äôt see that July 1st (Canada‚Äôs version of Independence Day) would be any different than June 30th. They just don‚Äôt make that little bit of effort to find out about the rest of the world, and it sometimes comes back to bite them like it has Whole Foods. This mistake by Whole Foods made headlines nationwide. The Prime Minister commented on it and the Premier of Ontario said he would initiate legislation to make it illegal for the banning of poppies in early November. That shows the depth of the mistake that Whole Foods made (I‚Äôm sure the decision came from their head office in Austin, Texas where they couldn‚Äôt be further away from Canada nor know much about us). Sure, they backed down when they realized the hornet‚Äôs nest they stirred up and sure, they‚Äôll be forgiven. But the stench they created for a couple of days will cling to them for a long time. When a company goes multinational they can never go wrong by learning about the other countries they propose to do business in and being sensitive to the feelings of those who they want to be their customers. The nearest Whole Foods to me is over 40 km away so it‚Äôs unlikely I would ever have shopped there anyway."},{"instruction":"What is Bootstrap?

To help the drought-hit farmers in Maharashtra, he gave a financial aid of Rs. 90 lakh to help 180 families of the farmers who had committed suicide. He also made a contribution of 50 lakh to Salman‚Äôs charitable trust Being Human. He also donated Rs 1 crore to Chennai‚Äôs flood relief. 2. Not many know that he also launched a martial arts school to provide self-defence training to women for free in Mumbai and has trained 4000 women! 3. During the shoot of Khatron Ke Khiladi, one of the participants was leaving the show because he under-performed. When Akshay asked him what he would have done with the winning amount, the participant said, \\"I will use it for my father's cancer operation\\". Akshay didn't just call him to console, he even gave him a Rs. 25 lakhs cheque. 4. Akshay sang and shot a music video of the Punjabi devotional song, Nirgun Raakh Liya and whatever profit he made, he donated to the victims of the train bombings of Mumbai on July 11, 2006. 5. Akshay slashed his endorsement fee for a brand that incurred losses because of drought! Akshay was earning close to Rs 10 crore to endorse the brand but he cut down this amount by almost half. 6. During promotions of his film Entertainment, Akshay attended an event organised by Youth Organization in Defence of Animals (YODA). Akshay bought a Burberry jacket from the exhibition for Rs. 1,00,000 and paid Rs. 3,60,000 for the same, donating the entire amount to YODA. 7. Akshay's monetary contribution to the Indian army deserves respect In August 2016, Akshay helped the family of Jawans with a monetary help of Rs 80 lakhs. Following the same tradition, Akshay again donated Rs 9 lakh to the family of martyred BSF jawan Gurnam Singh. The report claims that Gurnam Singh had succumbed to his injuries after being targeted by Pakistani snipers after foiling a major infiltration bid in J&K. In march 2017, Akshay Kumar had donated Rs 1.08 crore to the families of twelve slain jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Reports claimed that Akshay was in constant touch with IPS officer Amit Lodha, DIG of Jaisalmer sector north. After due inquiries, Akshay requested Lodha to share the details of the slain jawans' kin. Akshay then extended monetary help of Rs 9 lakh each to families of the martyred jawans. 8. In October 2016, Akshay extended monetary help to Ravi Shrivastava, the ailing producer of his debut film The aged producer was suffering from kidney failure and was in need of a transplant. Even though Akshay was feeling guilty that he could not get in touch with the producer because of his professional commitments, Akshay is doing all he can. After he was contacted on Twitter, he tweeted: The total cost of the kidney transplant was around 15-17 Lakhs. When Akshay was in his struggling days, Shrivastava was the first producer to offer him a film - Dwarpaal. 9. In November 2016, Akshay had volunteered to adopt a village hit by farmers' suicides Akshay met state finance minister, Sudhir Mungantiwar, in Mumbai and during the interaction, the minister explained Akshay about the woes of farmers in Vidarbha, particularly in Yavatmal. And after hearing and carefully analyzing everything, Akshay volunteered to adopt one of the villages hit hard by the farmers‚Äô suicides. 10. Akshay proposed and then eventually launched Bharat Ke Veer app and website to help people make monetary contributions to the families of martyred jawaans Akshay didn't just propose the idea to develop an app and a website called \\"Bharat Ke Veer\\" to enable direct donations to families of martyred jawaans, he helped the government execute it. 11. In April 2017, Akshay Kumar helped in developing a proper insurance scheme for Bollywood‚Äôs stunt artists The insurance scheme is going to cover 380 stuntmen and women between 18 and 55 years of age. In a case of hospitalization due to any physical injury or accident, while doing stunts, a stuntman will be covered for Rs six lakh at about 4,000 hospitals through a cashless system."},{"instruction":"A Kaiser technician told me that potassium has no effect on mood whatsoever, is that true?","output":"Potassium is essential for neural conductivity.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don‚Äôt want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"Could be as simple as a UTI and an antibiotic might clear it up. Unfortunately many vets will put an animal down simply because the owner wants it done, and if there is any health issue at all they are even more likely to do so. If this cat is treatable tell the vet you do not want it done. If it is your cat and you say so then you should have the say. Please beg your parents for a better solution. She sounds ill and likely either some infection or UTI. It is possible something is affecting her kidneys as well, and in that case immediate treatment with fluids may help. With kidney disease they often get constipated and that can cause vomiting. If you can find some beneficial bacteria or plain yogurt get her to consume that and give her lots of water so long as urine is coming out. That can help with a bladder. Please do not think it is a substitute for the vet. It is just till you get her there. Make sure she is defecating and urinating. With luck this may help her. Se will need aggressive treatment and or antibiotics from the vet. Also something else could be causing vomiting and the resultant dehydration can affect her kidneys thus causing her to urinate. She may have a fever and a fever in cats also can cause vomiting to be worse. A fever will also dehydrate a cat very quickly, and it can kill them quickly. You must get her treatment right away as vomiting is serious. It is possible the cat consumed something such as antifreeze that has affected the kidneys but there would likely be more severe symptoms as well such as staggering. Your parents are being horrible. They are responsible for the care and they do not want to do anything. It could cost under 100 to treat the cat in rural parts of america. The cat will need to be seen, may need fluids or antibiotics and that might be all they cat will need to get better. Do make sure the vet checks for dehydration and treats for it though, as some veterinarians will skip this."},{"instruction":"Why is intelligent design opposed by so many scientists?","output":"I don‚Äôt know that it is.

For example is the charges from the doorknob that would be transferred to you if touch. What is really the key term to understand electrostatics over electrodynamics?","output":"The names ElectroStatic and ElectroMagnetic were chosen long before we understood the mechanism of either form of radiation. Electrostatic force is the Coulomb force between particles with charge at essentially no velocity relative to each other. How and if the force changes with relative velocity near c and the quantum mechanism that makes it radiate and propagate we still do not know. ElectroMagnetic radiation is caused by forcedly oscillating a charge which already radiates electrostatic force such as electrons in the antenna of a radio-transmitter, or electrons in a light bulb. Electromagnetic radiation is consequently technically an ES wave with the frequency of the forced ‚ÄúEM‚Äù oscillation superimposed on the higher nuclear frequency of the ES carrier. Electromagnetism supports the same conclusion that rather than involving imaginary magnetic fields the forces at play is a compounding of Coulomb forces between a multitude of untethered electrons or quanta of charge in motion singularly or part of currents of electric charge."},{"instruction":"What is a list of skills that are amazing if you learn them?","output":"Skills must pay (feed you), not amaze.

Why or why not?","output":"Every action that we take in this world leaves an imprint on our subconscious. The intensity of the imprint depends on the quality of the action. Actions that are neutral like washing the dishes or normal routine work might leave minimal imprint. Actions that have ramifications on others, however, leave a larger imprint. I can tell you through a small example how this works. And many of you will be familiar with this. You have an argument with someone in the morning. You exchange heated words. You continue through the day but are a little disturbed, distracted, make a few careless errors, forget things, and the overall quality and productivity of your day is a little bit diminished. This is minor karma. For a more extreme action, where you do something really bad to a person, like hurting someone physically/mentally or engaging in corruption, the imprint is much larger. All these actions, especially the significant ones, are continuously being recorded by your subconscious. Your conscious mind can try to suppress this knowledge in your waking life, but the awareness of the things that you have done, is always just below the surface, ready to come up and break through into your consciousness. Now you have to find ways to suppress this. What will you do? You will try all the myriads of ways available to push it down - habits or behaviors that make you less alert, less conscious and that give you a relief from your own mind. Habits like alcoholism, drug addiction and reckless sex. Either you push it down till the day you die by indulging your senses, or being unable to push it down you become a perpetually angry, frustrated or depressed human being. Mostly it is both. This further produces its own ramifications and leads to broken relationships, an unsuccessful career and ill-health. This is karma. You can escape the best criminal justice system of the world but you cannot escape the justice meted out by the person sitting inside your own head.

Is there a better (meaning cheaper but ergonomically excellent) chair to buy for my home office?","output":"I own a furniture store... I'm around furniture all the time and when I wanted to give our 15 employees something nice to sit on... I was surprised at the BS that is out there. I did a ton of research prior to buying and like you, did not want to spend a small fortune on the Herman Miller chairs. Tested out a used Herman Miller chair and did not like the sizing; and the extra add-ons were not present on the chair I tested out. I ended up buying Raynor ErgoHuman chairs. they are about 1/2 the price of herman miller (600 each) and they have all the bells and whistles. We've had them now for 2 years and they all look brand new, still. Everybody's back is much better now than before. On the other hand if you want to go cheap for a good ergonomic chair, check out the Ikea ergo chairs. They are under 200 and a decent chair."},{"instruction":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"I will give you the best answer from experience for that: absolutely not!!! Private schools are a status symbol and that‚Äôs it. You do not get funding so you don‚Äôt get the best facilities, options, up to date text books, and the most important legit teachers. Private schools don‚Äôt pay teachers anything. So they can‚Äôt get or keep good teachers. So they have to settle for whoever they can get. Which usually means a barely graduated bachelor degree person or some desperate enough anyone they can find. That will leave before the school year is over. Most states you do not need a teaching degree, license, or any degree at all to teach in private schools. Anyone off the street can be a teacher. They don‚Äôt have to follow certain curriculum either. I went to private school K-8th. When I got to public high school me and all my classmates were all behind. I do feel that I was not given a proper education in private school. Even to this day I feel behind on things that should be second nature. Even look at my writings. They are littered with grammar errors. I was horrible at math until I took a beginners algebra class in college and taught the basics properly then it clicked. School was a struggle for me, and I thought I just wasn‚Äôt smart. It wasn‚Äôt until I was 22 and got analyzed by a psychiatrist that had me run multiple IQ tests I had learned I have an above average IQ. So I am a huge advocate for public schools. Because legally they have to teach certain fundamentals from licensed teachers. I wonder if I would of been in a better school setting if things would of been different for me."},{"instruction":"Which Turkic country has the purest Turks?","output":"I think some people do not understand the term ‚Äúpure‚Äù. There is no such thing as 100% pure ethnicity of its own with a single lineage going back to the advent of humanity. The attribute of being pure cannot be applied to the concept of ethnicity but to a broader genetic cluster (wrongly called race). Being Turkic is not measurable. Being East-Eurasian, or specifically Northeast Asian, is measurable. In terms of closest affinity to Proto- and Early Turks, both culturally and genetically, are probably the Altai Turks, Tuvan Turks, and or Khakas, as well as Kazakh and Kyrgyz: As far as genetic data can tell, Khakas are the closest to Proto-Turks (using Xiongnu Elite), followed by Tuvans and Altaians. The Khakas are the ones scoring the highest amount of proto-Turkic (Xiongnu Elite) ancestry. Other Turkic groups: Compare to modern Mongolians: Modern Mongolians have absorbed several Turkic tribes, which predated the Mongolic-speakers. Turkic peoples have Northeast Asian roots, so we are anyway distantly related to Mongol and Tungus peoples: ... ultimate Proto-Turkic homeland may have been located in a more compact area, most likely in Eastern Mongolia, that is, close to the ultimate Proto-Mongolic homeland in Southern Manchuria and the ultimate Proto-Tungusic homeland in the present-day borderlands of China, Russia and North Korea (Janhunen, 2010, pp. 293-294; Robbeets et al., in press; Figure 3). This hypothesis would explain the tight connections of Proto-Turkic with Proto-Mongolic and Proto-Tungusic, regardless of whether one interprets the numerous similarities between the three Altaic families as partly inherited or obtained owing to long-lasting contact. Proto-Turkic most likely can be associated with the Baikal EBA."},{"instruction":"f evolution were true (it clearly is not), what would observable evidence look like?","output":"Interesting hypothesis.

Please prevail on your idiot family to allow you to get the cat to the vet for treatment, not death. You don‚Äôt give the age of the cat, but if these symptoms are fairly recent and the cat is still trying to eat and drink despite its symptoms it is more likely an acute condition that can be treated and healed.

As one of the most powerful demons in the series, the Upper Moon demon from Demon Slayer is incredibly strong, quick, and regenerative. The outcome of a fight between Yajirobe and an Upper Moon demon would ultimately depend on a number of variables, including the particular skills and strategies each fighter uses, as well as the context and location of the conflict.

So what has been proposed by the evolutionists is that human beings and chimpanzees evolved from a common ancestor i.e. an ape. The split from the ape happened around 8 million years ago. If this is true, and both chimps and humans did in fact evolve from a single ancestor over 8 millions years ago, then we should have intermediatory species on both side of the branches i.e. from common ape to humans we should have humans at various stages of evolution, and similarly we should have chimps at various stages of evolution from common ape to chimp. However, we do not have any living species between humans and common ape, and neither between chimp and common ape. In fact there is no such evolving species any where in the world in any species whatsoever. So we do not find any species evolving into another species. What we have are examples of micro evolution where a species undergoes small changes to suit its changing environment. Thus e.g. some bacteria becomes resistant to a drug, or cows give more milk due to selective breeding, or crows and pigeons become accustomed to living in cities etc., however, bacteria will remain bacteria, cows will remain cow, crows will remain crows, and pigeons will remain pigeons. None of these will ever evolve into a new species.

Can I still I have a growth spurt?","output":"At 16, some guys are done growing, many are not. Which are your? The answer depends on only one thing - your bone age. The bone age is determined by the number of growth plates left in the X-ray of the left hand and wrist. Once they are closed, growth is over. This is typically at a bone age of around 17 - 18. For the average kid, the bone age is the same as their chronological age, but there is a lot of variation. You can get an X-ray to find out, but most physicians will not order this without a medical reason, not just to satisfy your curiosity. But, there is good correlation between bone age and puberty. Growth stops when puberty is complete, as the hormones play a large role in closing the bone‚Äôs growth plates. The final stage of puberty is called Tanner Stage 5. ([LINKED_TEXT: Tanner scale - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_scale]). The average age boys reach Tanner 5 is 15 - 17 years old and the average boy has reached his final adult height by age 16 or 17. Boys who start puberty earlier than average (11.5 years) will stop growing sooner and boys who start puberty later than average will grow until an older age. If your pubic hair extends from the crotch area to include the medial (inside) aspects of your thighs, this is Tanner 5. There is typically a year or two of growth left once Tanner 5 begins. Hair along the linea alba, the line that ‚Äúconnects‚Äù your pubic hair to your belly button generally means that growth is over. For males, if you need to shave everyday to avoid a 5 o‚Äôclock shadow look, you are finished growing taller."},{"instruction":"What is an easy, safe way to make money on your phone?","output":"Yes, as an online money making expert, I can say that you can definitely make money from your phone even if you're a student and don't have a job.

Whilst I do try and park in the least occupied area of a car park to avoid accidental knocks or scratches I will often come back to my car only to find it surrounded by other parked cars. I once asked a driver why he chose to park his standard middle of the range family car right next to mine in a half empty car park only for him to say if someone was looking to steal a car they would obviously select mine over his. But as has been said elsewhere a car is a tool first and foremost and much as I love my car if I spent all the time worrying about it getting scratched or damaged I‚Äôd never drive it so what is the point in that?"},{"instruction":"Why do console games still get physical releases but PC games don't?","output":"because with PC it‚Äôs easier to use digital platforms, especially since not everyone has or wants an optical drive in their computers anymore.

This despite Barr‚Äôs statement to the opposite.Trump knew that Russia was interfering in our election to benefit him and fully expected to benefit from it, while simultaneously lying to the American public and claiming it wasn‚Äôt Russia.There absolutely was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia; however, collusion is not a crime.Conspiracy is a crime. The evidence showed that both the Russian government and the Trump campaign knew of each other's efforts to help the other, lied to cover them up and worked to further each other‚Äôs goals; however, no formal agreement to conspire was found. (Apparently, just colluding to rig an election isn‚Äôt conspiracy unless there‚Äôs a formal agreement. This is pretty ridiculous and needs to be fixed in our laws ASAP.)Trump openly and repeatedly encouraged government officials and witnesses to lie to investigators to protect himself.Republican Senator Richard Burr obstructed justice by revealing to Trump the names of all targets of the investigation.Trump did order the special counsel to be fired.Nowhere in the unredacted portions was Bill Barr requested or advised to render a decision on if Trump obstructed Justice.Trump made an effort to get Sessions to limit the special counsel investigation to only preventing future Russian interference.Trump asked his attorney general to investigate his former political rivals.‚ÄúThe investigation identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and the Campaign expected it would benefit from information stolen and released by the Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.‚Äù That‚Äôs a hell of a long way from what Barr released, ‚Äú[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.‚Äù"},{"instruction":"w do homosexuals decide who is the alpha; coin toss?","output":"Paper rock Scissors .."},{"instruction":"f slavery wasn't abolished in 1865, how long do you think it would have lasted after 1865?","output":"How long?

A steam tractor, later a gas or diesel one, with implements, eliminated the need for a large work force, with all the problems involved in feeding, managing, etc. The same with manufacturing; automation is steadily eliminating jobs. That extends all the way to marketing, now, with people doing their own checkout, or buying online.

People assume that I‚Äôve been a writer for years. When I tell them that I‚Äôve only been writing for a few months and that they can write as well, they believe that I have formal training or a natural talent that they don‚Äôt. As much as I‚Äôd like to have these things, it‚Äôs not the case. I learned English growing up and wrote papers in college, but that‚Äôs it. To be a writer, you just need to write. You don‚Äôt need formal training, a robust lexicon, or natural talent. Becoming a writer starts with opening a blank page and attempting to express your thoughts. This process is incredibly challenging. More often than not, I spend countless hours staring at a screen and failing to write anything worth reading. But if you just start and keep going, a beautiful journey unfolds. As you think deeply about the topic at hand, your muddy thoughts turn into a few clear sentences. You continue writing, and you start to see a path through the fog. You keep chopping down the limbs hanging in your way and trust that you‚Äôll eventually find the sunlight. After many more hours of work, you see a small beam of light that lets you know that you are close to distilling the mess into something that another person can understand. After a few more rewrites, you accept the imperfect nature of your work, and you hit publish. Sometimes this process leads to a great article. Most times, it doesn‚Äôt. Every time, it makes you at least one percent clearer on your thoughts about the topic at hand. Over time, writing gets a little easier, but not much. You experiment with new techniques. You start to find your voice. You settle into the imperfection. Along the way, you learn to live with the self-doubt and rest easy knowing that you‚Äôre doing your best. You accept that good enough is indeed good enough. To become a writer, you need to brace yourself for this challenging journey and start writing. Stop waiting. Stop analyzing other writers. Stop looking for courses to take. If you want to be a writer, start writing.

If you are asking on a broad level I think the obvious answers was to get the script approved by George R. R. Martin and give him more creative control. The books haven‚Äôt been finished, and at this rate they probably never will be, so the show was lacking in direction. The producers weren‚Äôt up to the task and were shown to be woefully incompenet, so it they should have been replaced (hindsight is 20/20). From a the perspective of the story I don‚Äôt think there is an easy solution. The simplest explantion is that the show needs to earn the conclusion it is building towards. They also need to take in to consideration the changes they made from the book and be a little less agenda driven. Also, they need to take pacing into consideration.

Layman, Ph.D., professor emeritus in the Department of Food Science & Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois. So making sure your diet doesn‚Äôt skimp on this macronutrient is vital if you want to get the most out of your workouts. Plus, [LINKED_TEXT: research] [URL: http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)00042-3/abstract] suggests protein dulls your hunger, which is good news for your waistline. ‚ÄúWhen a higher proportion of calories come from protein, it minimizes the loss of muscle mass during weight loss, and helps drive the weight loss towards body fat,‚Äù explains Laymen. But what if you prefer beans over beef? Can you still get all the protein your body needs to look and perform its best on a vegetarian diet? Worry not, tofu lovers. A recent Arizona State University [LINKED_TEXT: study] [URL: http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/8/11/726] found no difference in measures of strength or endurance ‚Äî or levels of lean body mass ‚Äî in vegetarian athletes compared to meat eaters. With some strategic planning, it‚Äôs entirely possible to [LINKED_TEXT: power your muscles on plant protein] [URL: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2017/02/07/ajcn.116.136762.abstract?sid=187de680-e319-4d4d-8179-da6ab0835359]. But first, you need to know how much protein is necessary to show your muscles some love. Read on to find out how you can gain without eating meat. If you‚Äôre hitting the weight room regularly, Laymen suggests shooting for about 1.5 grams of [LINKED_TEXT: protein] [URL: https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19540593/ultimate-guide-to-protein-supplements/] for every kilogram you weigh (that‚Äôs 116 grams for a 170-pound guy) to ensure the breakdown of your muscles [LINKED_TEXT: doesn‚Äôt outstrip muscle protein synthesis] [URL: https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8], the driving force behind your gains. [LINKED_TEXT: Endurance athletes] [URL: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0157406] should aim for 1.2 ‚Äì 1.4 grams per kilogram of body weight. Now, the amount of protein you consume throughout the day makes a difference, too. Research suggests you should spread your intake throughout the day (roughly 20 to 35 grams per meal) if you‚Äôre looking to gain, says Laymen. You‚Äôll also want to be sure you‚Äôre getting a steady supply of the essential amino acid leucine, since it acts as the primary trigger to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. The more leucine a food contains, the better job it will do at stimulating muscle growth. ‚ÄúI recommend that guys eat at least two meals each day containing 2.5 to 3.0 grams of [LINKED_TEXT: leucine] [URL: http://jn.nutrition.org/content/144/11/1694.abstract?etoc] and about 8 to 10 grams total for the day,‚Äù says Laymen. As a rule of thumb, animal-based proteins like chicken, beef, and yogurt have a higher protein quality score than their plant-based counterparts, including legumes and grains, [LINKED_TEXT: because they are denser in leucine and other essential amino acids] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21167687?dopt=Abstracthttp%3A%2F%2Fjn.nutrition.org%2Fcontent%2F145%2F9%2F1981.short]. ‚ÄúSo while you can get enough protein from plants, you need to eat more total protein to compensate for their lower digestibility,‚Äù Laymen explains, meaning you absorb less protein per ounce when you stick to plant-based foods.. if you want to buy protein, contact us on google keymart.in"},{"instruction":"What‚Äôs your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","output":"The best advise would be to understand her freedom, rights and limits before being an adult.

As I said, in any case, a proxy works in a way that allows you to protect your privacy, such as your IP address, but also gives you access to specific locations that you can access. I'm talking about your workplace, schools, libraries, etc. With a proxy, you will be able to use websites that have been blocked by your network provider. As such, it will enable you to surf the Internet using another server with another IP address. So if you are blocked in any web address then this is not the end of the world because you can still navigate using proxy and not only that, you can browse more securely using a web-based proxy.

Though each are natural and quarried from the planet, they possess terribly totally different properties. the largest distinction between granite and marble is their porousness. Granite, whose crystalline structure makes it a lot of proof against abrasion, staining, and discoloration, is in fact, the strongest of all natural stones. Granite is an stone, which implies it was once molten and shaped because it cooled deep among the planet. The minerals contained in granite sometimes seem as little flecks throughout the stone. Marble, on the opposite hand, was once stone that modified thanks to intense heat and pressure. This method altered its crystalline structure and introduced different minerals that turn out its characteristic veining. Both marble and granite are arduous, heavy, comparatively heat and scorch proof, and are available in a very big selection of colours and patterns. Since each are created in nature, there is forceful variations in color and pattern. In each cases, a show sample you see in-store might not be an correct representation of your actual purchase.

However, he was addicted to his own 352 formation and always believe his familiar players too much. In fact, I personally think he wan‚Äôt confident for himself. He was always stressing that ‚Äòwe are the weakest team in top twleve and we must first expect a draw rather than a victory.‚Äô When it turned to the result of matches, ChinaPR only got one score in all the 3 matches and ranked last in the scoreboard.

Why are there POPtarts, but no MOMtarts?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúBecause of the PASTRY-archy.‚Äù said my friend Ramses‚Äîvia text on Christmas day. ‚ÄúThat is the worst joke I have ever heard,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOh, also, see you 7am tomorrow for training?‚Äù ‚ÄúHouse of sloth?‚Äù ‚ÄúYessir.‚Äù After this text conversation, me, Ramses, and a few other friends of mine got together at 7am on a cold Monday morning in Chicago and beat the living hell out of each other for an hour. We do this just about every day. That‚Äôs my life. It‚Äôs pretty‚Ä¶ different. I‚Äôve never written anything about friendship before because writing about friendship makes me uncomfortable. My friends are real. I value their opinions. I don‚Äôt want to say anything about friendship that makes me seem like a bad friend, so most of the time, I say nothing. I‚Äôm horrible at telling people how important they are to me. For many years, I was a bad friend. I am imperfect. Part of the reason I‚Äôve always felt like I was such a bad friend is that for a long time, I didn‚Äôt feel any connection toward any of my friends. I liked them, but I didn‚Äôt care deeply for them. I didn‚Äôt love my friends because I didn‚Äôt love myself. The cliche is true: it‚Äôs really hard to love other people when you don‚Äôt love yourself. Then, about a year ago, something changed. All of a sudden, I realized that I was becoming a person that I actually liked being around. I actually cared about the direction of my life. I finally had the sense of purpose that I had always wanted. There was just one problem: none of the people in my life at the time wanted to steer their lives in similar directions as me. I had to do this exhausting thing where I completely re-assessed the people in my life and started making time with people who were actually important to me. Making choices in life is scary and tiring, but if you don‚Äôt do it, you‚Äôll be stuck forever chasing people, seeking validation, and feeling alone and isolated. One thing that started happening to me this year was that my friends started telling me that they loved me. At first, this was weird to me. I‚Äôve never had deep emotional connections with friends before. When my friends tell me they love me, I don‚Äôt tell them how much it fucks with my head. I don‚Äôt just randomly blurt out to my friends that it fucks with me that my friends say they love me more often than my parents. I don‚Äôt tell my friends that I can‚Äôt remember the last time anyone in my family told me they loved me. I just say ‚Äúlove you too, dude‚Äù and try to appreciate the fact that I have people in my life who actually tell me that they care about me. People who want to see me do well. My friends know about my experience with derealization, but it‚Äôs hard to understand the depth of the pain and isolation that derealization causes, especially if you‚Äôve never experienced anything like it before. But I‚Äôve stopped asking for people to understand me. I just want them to accept me. Most people don‚Äôt understand the isolation that derealization and mental illness can cause, but I do. That‚Äôs why when the people in my life who care about me let me know that they care about me, it makes me so grateful that I could cry. Friendship is beautiful because it can remind you that the world isn‚Äôt as bad as it seems when you‚Äôre head is in a dark place. My life is pretty intense. Today, I spent 3 hours fighting people in gyms and 2 hours teaching people how to fight. In training, things get heated sometimes. People swear. They get mad at each other. Sometimes, ‚Äúsparring‚Äù gets out of hand, and people want to hurt each other for real. That makes it sound more intense than it is, but the point is, when you‚Äôre literally fighting for your livelihood, you can‚Äôt help but get a little emotional. This isn‚Äôt a hobby for me, this is my life. This is my real fucking life. There are no ‚Äúdo-overs‚Äù, and this is what I have chosen to do with my one trip through the universe. Trying to be a professional athlete is intense. The mistakes make you want to crawl out of your skin. The wins can bring you to tears. The friendships that you make when you‚Äôre living an intense lifestyle like this are unlike any sort of casual friendship you would build around the office water cooler or online. The bonds I have with my friends are so strong because I understand the fragility of their dreams and the dedication they‚Äôve put into getting to where they are, and they understand the same for me. It‚Äôs a combination of respect, admiration, and joy that creates a great friendship. So, what is the meaning of friendship? The meaning of friendship is not complicated. You need friends the same way that your ancestors needed friends. There is nothing wrong with desiring friendship and connection, especially in today‚Äôs dry digital world. Friendship helps you stay safe, physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and existentially. If I didn‚Äôt have friends who were on the same path that I‚Äôm on, I‚Äôd feel like a lunatic. My friends on my path think like me. They act like me. They are like me. Friendship is a way of easing the painful reality that in the end, all of us will die alone.

In case you feel that one is too reduced, add relationships to the money. Long: Lets start with a real story A few years ago I worked in Human Resource and talked to a software architect about his last project. He told me he was working in a company that planted Bitcoin vending machines in some bigger cities. The CEO of the company was a young man who got 5 Million Euro from his father to show him how good he is in doing business. They negotiated contracts and advertised at some of the biggst news outlets of the country. Result: Investment: 3.5M Euro ‚Äì for some obvious reasons because.... Income 1st month: 15K Euro Income 2nd month: 3,5K Euro Income 3rd month: not even 1.000.- Euro because they were already in the process of closing.... You could say he was fast in building his venture, but he was also fast in destroying it. A few months of research would have reduced the costs significantly and maybe even proved the business as a bad idea from the get-go. What he intended to do was to build a venture of getting rich quick and that is not how it works. Relationships - it matters where you come from: 2 extreme examples but you get the point. Life is not fair and never will be. Some already get born with an advantage. Not them to blame though, that¬¥s just how it is. Case 1: You get born in rural Eritrea, 200 miles away from the next village. Education is basic, your parents are both illiterate and don¬¥t care about you gaining knowledge outside the farming area too. Guess how fast such a person could make it to become a millionaire? Case 2: You get born to wealthy US business man and the idea of lack is foreign to you until you become a teenager where you somehow stumble upon a beggar and happen to talk to him. That is why it¬¥s so important to never compare yourself to others! Never compare your step 3 with someone elses step 85! Case 2 guy maybe already started at Case 1 guys step 27, who might need to start with learning a commonly spoken language and move to a bigger city and eventually to an other country. Another example, maybe from the most famous one: Probably the most famous example of slow rich is Warren Buffet and since in the news just recently his son Peter. He invested 90K USD in stocks of Berkshire Hathaway in 1977 and was able to cash out 200M USD in 2020. Slowly and consistant wins the race. What you see here is: Mindset is everything! E. g. A lottery winner can¬¥t change his mindset fast enough to handle his new fortune properly. He might end up having a good time for 2 years, but eventually ending up poorer than in the beginning. You can¬¥t eat a Lambo nor can you drink from a golden watch. It¬¥s the education of how to handle money and seperation between assets and liabilities. To finish this, a final note to the top answer to this question. It took the example of the gold rush in the 19th century. Keep this example in the back of your head, who do you think will be the one who will get rich slower but more sustainable? The one who diggs for gold and maybe never finds some, or the one who sells the digging equipment?

When they arrived here it was like Africa with megafauna and comparatively lush vegetation. Like any humans arriving in a new place they are not immediately in tune with the environment. Just as the arrival of the Maori in New Zealand resulted in the extinction of the moa, so there were extinctions from over hunting. Then they were using fire, not to take care of the land but to facilitate hunting practices. These repetitive fires resulted in the flora that wasn't fire tolerant retreating from most of the country. This is why Australia is now dominated by fire tolerant and fire encouraging flora. However even fire tolerant trees can't handle fires as small saplings. So repetitive burning eventually created loads of grasslands that the early white explorers wrote about in their journals. Were you ever taught in school about Australia Felix? If you look at drawings done by the explorers, the place was park like and very easy to travel over because of the lack of undergrowth. The aborigines had created a new equilibrium that required constant burning to maintain. They call this taking care of the land, and they were taking care to maintain their harmonious relationship with the equilibrium in nature that they had created tens of thousands of years previously. When the aborigines were prevented from their burning practices, forests grew where there had been grasslands when the whites first arrived. I have seen photos from the late 1800s of grassy hills and then photos of the same hills in the 1950s that were forested. All this also coincided with a changing climate that may or may not have at least been partially worsened by the accelerated retreat of the rainforests etc. Just as the loss of the Amazon rainforest will affect the climate in South America. So the aborigines may have changed Australia as much as whites have, it just took tens of thousands of years for it to happen. They then lived in harmony with this new equilibrium, but they needed to actively maintain that equilibrium with their land care activities of controlled burning."},{"instruction":"Why were William and Kate asked to give up their prince and princess titles?","output":"Where on earth did you see that?

Yes they can, and some of these models are actually manufactured with an optional, manual safety, but the next question is, why would you? They are already manufactured with a built in safety system which prevents the firearm from going off, unless the trigger is pulled all the way to the rear. This renders a modern, semi-automatic pistol as safe as any revolver, which never really had a manual safety included anyway. For those who say because of added drop safety, you clearly have no idea how a manual safety works. The manual safety merely blocks a trigger from engaging the sear. In a drop situation, especially on a striker fired gun, the sear slips off of the firing mechanism due to the impact force on the firearm. A manual safety does nothing to prevent that.

Well underneath all that rhetoric, it‚Äôs not about finches and fossils. It‚Äôs about people, and society, isn‚Äôt it. Behind the propagation of any idea is the money it takes to market it. In Western Europe, that money came from the 19th century Western Colonization. In the US, there was no such money, and so the social implication of ‚ÄúDarwinism‚Äù has never reached the same degree of social consensus. Darwin published his grand opus in 1859. At that time, the Europeans occupied about 10% of Africa. By 1920, that number has increased to 90%. So between 1860 to 1920 was a time of extremely vigorous expansion of European colonization into the third world. [LINKED_TEXT: Scramble for Africa - Wikipedia1880s‚Äì1900s Western European colonisation of Africa Areas of Africa controlled by European colonial powers in 1913 Belgian (yellow), British (pink), French (blue), German (teal), Italian (lime green), Portuguese (purple), and Spanish (mauve) Empires. The Scramble for Africa [a] is a term widely used by historians to describe the invasion, annexation, division, and colonization of most of Africa by seven Western European powers during an era known as \\" New Imperialism \\" (between 1833 and 1914). The 10 percent of Africa that was under formal European control in 1870 increased to almost 90 percent by 1914, with only Liberia and Ethiopia remaining independent. [1] The Berlin Conference of 1884, which regulated European colonization and trade in Africa, is usually accepted as the beginning. [2] In the last quarter of the 19th century, there were considerable political rivalries between the European empires , which provided the impetus for the Scramble. [3] The later years of the 19th century saw a transition from \\" informal imperialism \\" ‚Äì military influence and economic dominance ‚Äì to direct rule. [4] Most of Africa was decolonised during the Cold War period. However, the old imperial boundaries and economic systems imposed by the Scramble still affect the politics and economy of African nations to today. [5] Background [ edit ] By 1841, businessmen from Europe had established small trading posts along the coasts of Africa, but they seldom moved inland, preferring to stay near the sea. They primarily traded with locals. Large parts of the continent were essentially uninhabitable for Europeans because of their high mortality rates from tropical diseases such as malaria . [6] In the middle of the 19th century, European explorers mapped much of East Africa and Central Africa . As late as the 1870s, Europeans controlled approximately 10% of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coasts. The most important holdings were Angola and Mozambique , held by Portugal ; the Cape Colony , held by Great Britain; and Algeria , held by France. By 1914, only Ethiopia and Liberia remained independent of European control, with the former eventually being colonised* by Italy in 1936 and the latter having strong connections to the United States. [7] Technological advances facilitated European expansion overseas. Industrialization brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for tropical diseases, which helped control their adverse effects. The development of quinine , an effective treatment for malaria, made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.

The Germans went to Namibia to rape their women and genocide them all; The Boers didn‚Äôt invade London to rob them of British gold. The Brits went put the Boers into concentration camps and robbed them of their gold mines. So how do you rationalize all these. Mr. Darwin‚Äôs Origin of Species was irrevocably linked to ‚ÄúSocial Darwinism‚Äù at birth. Another of these social interpretations of Darwin's biological views, later known as eugenics, was put forth by Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, in 1865 and 1869. Galton argued that just as physical traits were clearly inherited among generations of people, the same could be said for mental qualities (genius and talent). Galton argued that social morals needed to change so that heredity was a conscious decision, to avoid both the over-breeding by less fit members of society and the under-breeding of the more fit ones.

(zoology) F. Galton , Galton Sir Francis Galton FRS FRAI ( / Àà …° …îÀê l t …ôn / ; 16 February 1822 ‚Äì 17 January 1911) was a British polymath in the Victorian era . [1] He was a proponent of social Darwinism , eugenics , and scientific racism . Galton was knighted in 1909. [2] Galton produced over 340 papers and books. He also developed the statistical concept of correlation and widely promoted regression toward the mean . He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and inheritance of intelligence , and introduced the use of questionnaires and surveys for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his anthropometric studies. He was a pioneer of eugenics , coining the term itself in 1883, and also coined the phrase \\" nature versus nurture \\". [3] His book Hereditary Genius (1869) was the first social scientific attempt to study genius and greatness . [4] As an investigator of the human mind, he founded psychometrics (the science of measuring mental faculties) and differential psychology , as well as the lexical hypothesis of personality. He devised a method for classifying fingerprints that proved useful in forensic science . He also conducted research on the power of prayer , concluding it had none due to its null effects on the longevity of those prayed for. [5] His quest for the scientific principles of diverse phenomena extended even to the optimal method for making tea. [6] As the initiator of scientific meteorology , he devised the first weather map , proposed a theory of anticyclones , and was the first to establish a complete record of short-term climatic phenomena on a European scale. [7] He also invented the Galton Whistle for testing differential hearing ability. [8] He was Charles Darwin 's half-cousin. [9] Early life [ edit ] Galton was born at \\"The Larches\\", a large house in the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham , England, built on the site of \\"Fair Hill\\", the former home of Joseph Priestley , which the botanist William Withering had renamed. He was Charles Darwin 's half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent Erasmus Darwihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton]In Galton's view, social institutions such as [LINKED_TEXT: welfare] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_provision] and [LINKED_TEXT: insane asylums] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital] were allowing inferior humans to survive and reproduce at levels faster than the more \\"superior\\" humans in respectable society, and if corrections were not soon taken, society would be awash with \\"inferiors\\". Darwin read his cousin's work with interest, and devoted sections of Descent of Man to discussion of Galton's theories. The most famous philosopher at the time, [LINKED_TEXT: Herbert Spencer - WikipediaEnglish philosopher and political theorist (1820‚Äì1903) Herbert Spencer (27 April 1820 ‚Äì 8 December 1903) was an English polymath active as a philosopher , psychologist , biologist , sociologist , and anthropologist . Spencer originated the expression \\" survival of the fittest \\", which he coined in Principles of Biology (1864) after reading Charles Darwin 's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . The term strongly suggests natural selection , yet Spencer saw evolution as extending into realms of sociology and ethics, so he also supported Lamarckism . [1] [2] Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, literature, astronomy, biology, sociology, and psychology. During his lifetime he achieved tremendous authority, mainly in English-speaking academia. Spencer was \\"the single most famous European intellectual in the closing decades of the nineteenth century\\" [3] [4] but his influence declined sharply after 1900: \\"Who now reads Spencer?\\" asked Talcott Parsons in 1937. [5] Early life and education [ edit ] Spencer was born in Derby , England, on 27 April 1820, the son of William George Spencer (generally called George). [6] Spencer's father was a religious dissenter who drifted from Methodism to Quakerism , and who seems to have transmitted to his son an opposition to all forms of authority. He ran a school founded on the progressive teaching methods of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and also served as Secretary of the Derby Philosophical Society , a scientific society which had been founded in 1783 by Erasmus Darwin , the grandfather of Charles Darwin . Spencer was educated in empirical science by his father, while the members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-Darwinian concepts of biological evolution, particularly those of Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck . His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer, [7] vicar of Hinton Charterhouse near Bath , completed Spencer's limited formal education by teaching him some mathematics and physics, and enough Latin to enable him to translate some easy texts. Thomas Spencer also imprinted on his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views. Otherwise, Spencer was an autodidact who acquired most of his knowledge from narrowly focused readings and conversations with his friends and acquaintances. [8] As a young man Both as an adolescent and as a young man, Spencer found it difficult to settle to any intellectual or professional discipline. He worked as a civil engineer during the railway boom of the late 1830s, while also devoting much of his time to writing for provincial journals that were nonconformist in their religion and radical in their politics. Writing [ edit ] Spencer published his first bookhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer]was a lifelong friend of Huxley, ran Erasmus Darwin‚Äôs foundation, and advocated ‚Äú imperialism had served civilization by clearing the inferior races off the earth‚Äù. Basically you had the Brits and the French doing the ‚Äúclearing the inferior races‚Äù thing, the Belgians dividing the Hutus and the Tutsis. The Swedes researching eugenics. And the Germans measuring skull shapes and writing up ‚Äúhierarchy of races with the Aryans on top‚Äù. Massive amount of money, and government support, flowed into ‚Äúsocial Darwinism‚Äù, for A WHOLE CENTURY. Finally the whole thing blew up in WWII. Yeah the Nazis. That‚Äôs the logical conclusion of Social Darwinism. The colonizers routinely wiped out 30% - 90% of the native people in the colonies, and nobody batted an eyelash. The Nazis polished off ~ 1% - 2% of the locals in Western Europe, and ~ 10% of the population in Eastern Europe, and people were shocked. Turned out people couldn‚Äôt stomach it when the knives fell on their own backs. The US, by the luck of history, didn‚Äôt have this experience. In fact, the US just fought the Civil War from 1861 - 1865 to end slavery in the South, and then spent the next 60 years digesting the South and the West. America was a much more liberal place in late 19th century than Europe was. It was a poor, small, and weak power, suffering from LABOR SCARCITY, with an army the size of Portugal by WWII. Although there were some businessmen such as Rockefeller, for example, famously claimed ‚ÄúThe growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest...the working out of a law of nature and a law of God.‚Äù the vast majority of the American elites were staunchly anti-imperialist. I mean, do you think they wanted to go back to living under the thumb of the English King? No? Then no to imperialism! The popular narrative simply portrays those Americans who are against evolution as ‚Äúpoor dumb anti-intellectual rednecks‚Äù. Do you really believe that they care so much about finches and fossils? No, of course not. They are worried: If evolution works for finches, does it also work for people? If it works for people, does it mean poor dumb people should be thrown under the bus? ‚Ä¶ so am I the one who‚Äôs gonna be thrown under the bus? You can not explain the enduring support of the US evangelicals unless you are willing to look directly at these ALLIENATED people. 99% of them can add 1 and 2 together perfectly. If they say they can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt like the result (or what they think will be the result).

This is because when asked to pick a random number, we pick numbers that seem random to us, rather than being completely random. For example: if I were to tell you to pick a random number between 1 and 10, you‚Äôre significantly more likely to pick a number like 7. Numbers that have few factors and seem irregular. Another good example of human ‚Äúrandomness‚Äù vs. actual randomness is the shuffle option on music players. People used to complain that apple‚Äôs shuffle wasn‚Äôt random enough, because sometimes two songs from the same album or something would play consecutively. In reality, this is to be expected in a completely random shuffling, sometimes a coincidence like that just occurs. To fix this, they modified the algorithm to prevent things like that from happening. Essentially, they made the algorithm less random so that it feels more random. On the other hand, a computer has no such bias. The algorithm generates a number, regardless of how ‚Äúrandom‚Äù it feels.

The reason is, there is no good gun regulation that has actually worked as sold (notice I didn‚Äôt say intended as it worked perfectly in Australia during the Covid scare and by working perfectly I mean for the government, not the people). Let‚Äôs go down the list of failed gun regulation. 1996 assault weapons ban: not withstanding the horribly vaguely defined terminology gun violence actually increased as did mass shootings because the underlying core problem was not addressed, assessing, diagnosing and treating mental instability.gun free zones , invented after columbine . The result, areas defined as invitations for people whom use weapons for evil or are mentally unstable to use said weapons and cause massive damage with delayed reaction time.universal background checks: as anything installed by government , poorly ran . Not for the obvious loopholes that quite honestly anyone looking to break the law can get around but the actual system itself failing on multiple occasions when people whom did have a record of violence were still allowed to buy a gun legally. The reality is there is no gun control legislation that works because the people that would disobey that legislation would already have intent on disobeying legislation against murder, assault, armed robbery , rape , and a long list of other violent crimes that can be accomplished in a myriad of ways with or without guns doing the same or more damage (for instance making a bomb which is very much illegal as well). There‚Äôs an old adage that serves well here: an armed society is a polite society.

TM is based on the use of a specific mantra, which is repeated silently during the meditation practice. The technique is intended to promote relaxation, reduce stress and anxiety, and increase overall well-being.

I get it, parenting is not easy. I don‚Äôt blame you for this but I find it very hard not to. It‚Äôs not your fault, but if only‚Ä¶ I am writing this as I‚Äôm almost 15. I am not the son you think I am. Yes, I let you into my world a few times but most of me has never been revealed to you. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve been hiding my rebellious streak. I don‚Äôt blame you. But, as many other anonymous answerers have stated, you did not provide a healthy and supportive safety net for me. I‚Äôm sitting here, glossy-eyed, as I think about how I will never experience a proper childhood where my parents will be proud of me. They are proud, but of the me that I disclose to them. You made me feel as if I had to keep things from you. It started when I got a phone. Aged 11, I was starting Middle School. I discovered fanfic, sites like Reddit and Quora, Discord and so on. Slowly but surely, I explored many hobbies, many passions. I knew you didn‚Äôt approve of this online communication. I sidestepped your device restrictions, I lied and hid and covered my tracks. At 1:00 at night, I would explore my secret world, the only thing keeping me happy. You think I sleep in because I‚Äôm a lazy teen. I do it because I spend hours at night keeping myself happy. It‚Äôs probably why I am not depressed or have clinical anxiety. You think I am a good kid, who gets good grades and studies in most of his free time. And I am. I get amazing grades but it never seems like you are proud. You focus on the one grade that‚Äôs lower than the rest, without registering that my results are far above average in every subject. But I never got to have that close relationship that I now yearn for. Because, although you never see it, I too have crushes sometimes. I too like to joke and have fun. I am passionate about the things I enjoy, but you will never learn too much about them because you made me feel like I could not confide in you. I‚Äôm an introvert, it‚Äôs not unclear that I need my space. You would never give it to me. Without privacy or respect from you, I grew to become more secretive and rebellious instead. Apparently very well, since I‚Äôve only been caught once or twice at night and never later than 11:00. You cannot sympathise with me. Relating to me is pointless because you cannot understand what I‚Äôm experiencing. So instead of trying to control my life for me, just be there. Was it so hard? Your double standards hurt me. You‚Äôd tell me to be myself but scorn me if I was. You would rant about why I should do less gaming and confiscate my joy, which only made me resent you. Your reasons were vague and you felt the need to make me unhappy with the excuse of ‚Äòjust because‚Äô or ‚Äòcos I said so‚Äô. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt trust you. I‚Äôm sorry. You would never admit your mistakes. You could never see what I was feeling because you were too busy being right. And I ended up hiding much of it anyway. You didn‚Äôt pay attention to how you made me feel, so why would I feel loved? I did talk back. I do protest and argue. But anything that I could be seriously punished for is 100% covert and expertly done. I learned to be secretive and hide things from the people in my life that spent the most time with me. The truth is, I don‚Äôt even feel guilty about hiding things. The lying, the deceit is all justified because I was looking after myself. I should feel bad, but I see it in the same way as I see Robin Hood: doing morally grey things with a morally superior justification. I can‚Äôt feel shame for this because it was the right thing to do. The thing is, it‚Äôs not my fault. It was definitely you guys that rooted this. My friends know of my night time activities and are supportive in every other way. Yes, I‚Äôm still private about personal things but I sustain a great friendship with them regardless. I separate my friend-time persona from my home-time one, so that I can escape the mindset I take on in my house and be myself. I feel like Dr Jekyll and his hidden persona as Hyde. Your petty rules about screen time and Internet use, restricting which apps I could download, these always frustrated me but I got past them easily enough in the end. I found a way to get Insta and Snap even though you banned me from them, I sustained an online life throughout. Writing this now, all I can do is sigh at 00:48. My friends have healthy and free relationships with their parents and it can be embarrassing for me to tell them that my parents actually don‚Äôt know that I do something or another that we talk about commonly. I would never do drugs, I am cautious always, I never even go out (since I‚Äôm not old enough to roam the streets). I am, by all descriptors, a good kid who has a completely normal life, except that I lie and hide my true self every day and stay up till one in the morning in order to be who I really am. I feel empty inside. The tiny things we fight over are pointless. You make me feel horrible due to them though. It‚Äôs sad that your restrictions that plagued my life are what tore us so far apart. We‚Äôre tired. Our school system is at least three times harder than anything you had to do. We have clubs and other interests and only so much time and energy. We are stressed so we don‚Äôt need you adding to the mix. I shut you out, I feel bad about it but it still wasn‚Äôt my fault. If anything, it came from your parent‚Äôs parents who used this same parenting style to garner obedience. Strict parents makes sneaky kids, that‚Äôs the saying. It‚Äôs unnervingly true. Look, I‚Äôll be honest. I know you, as my parents, love me. You do. I feel it, sometimes. I appreciate everything that you do and I miss the old times when we were so open. But you changed and I have changed too. It's not like that anymore and I don‚Äôt think it can ever be that good again. There is room for improvement but becoming close again may take five years. Recently, it‚Äôs been more of a strain. Things changed, yay a pandemic, and now we argue almost daily. You struggle to relinquish control. To give the reigns to me and let me lead my own life. You love me, yes, but you do not support me. Maybe you‚Äôve got some traditional parenting styles that have rubbed off on you as well, but whatever it is, it sucks for my wellbeing. You can‚Äôt ever sit back and watch. We argue over tiny things that you blow out of proportion because when you are stressed you become perfectionistic and controlling. Thank you. You taught me valuable life skills such as picking the right people to trust, looking after myself and recognising what makes me feel good. I love and appreciate you but I‚Äôm hurt, okay? I bleed red, deep inside, every time you make me feel like I haven‚Äôt done well enough. But I know what values are mine, now that I‚Äôm forced to be independent."},{"instruction":"What are some of the best blogging tools?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: SEO] [URL: https://www.jsvitsolutions.in/] best tools 1.Google PageSpeed Insights 2.Google Analytics 3.Google Search Console 4.Google Ads Keyword Planner 5.Ahrefs Webmaster Tools 6.Answer the Public 7.Google trends & more‚Ä¶.."},{"instruction":"What are those INTP things that no one else can do?","output":"We have the highest natural ability to perceive the actual truth and are most likely to actual find it if we burden ourselves with discovering the truth.

What was the Young Turk's involvement in this genocide?","output":"Talaat Pasha was the ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù of the genocide, he had help of course. Jemal Pasha and Enver Pasha were co-conspirators and even co-sharing the empire with them. The Young Turks party promised the Christians that they could share with their vision of a new Ottoman Empire. The Christians fell for this, since they have suffered heavy persecution for centuries under the Sultans, and especially under Sultan Abdul Hamid the Second, known to Europe as ‚ÄúThe Bloody Sultan‚Äù. Word got out very quickly to the rest of Europe that his massive anti-Christian pogroms were deadly, it was a way of keeping the Christians silent, a way to shut them up when they asked for equal rights that the Muslims had. He saw these requests as threats, even though they had no weapons. The Christians who joined the Young Turks party, saw this as a way of starting over and that they would be able to have equal rights that they did not get under the Sultans. The Ottoman Empire was collapsing, and much of their lost territories were originally Christian dominated. For instance Greece was lost to them in 1822, Georgia and modern-day Armenia were under the control of the Russian Empire, and Eastern Europe was lost to them over a number of years. Remember, Christians and Muslims have a history of fighting one another over land and religion, whether or not we want to admit it. None of these two have a clean record or are free of bloodshed, to say otherwise is very naive. Back to the Armenians, even though the Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians made up a very small percentage of the population of the Ottoman Empire (about 4 to 5 million of them vs 25 million Muslims), the Ottoman Empire couldn‚Äôt afford to loose more land or allow these Christians to encourage the Russians to come in and steal land from them. Here‚Äôs the thing, the majority of these Christians were innocent, they weren‚Äôt even legally allowed to take up arms against the Muslims, especially not in self-defense. Sure there were protests and even some activities of self-dense, but you cannot compare pockets of self-defense vs governmental persecution or genocide. This thinking of Russians coming to take land because the Christians welcomed it, was more or less an example of a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario. Even if the Russians did take land from the Turks, they wouldn‚Äôt have been that nice to the Christians either. That‚Äôs why it was called ‚ÄúThe Russian Empire‚Äù its meant to be more in favor of Russians than Armenians or Greeks. They used this ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thinking, as a perfect scapegoat when the Ottoman Empire tried to take the Caucasus from the Russians, who had Eastern Armenians fighting alongside them. They exaggerated the truth, only a few Western Armenians actually joined sides with the Russians and their Eastern cousins. Enver Pasha was an egocentric moron who got a lot of his soldiers in various battles killed, based on horrible battle tactics and he blamed a lot of these loses onto the Armenians, even after a few Armenians saved his life in battle. So in the first stages of the genocide, they disarmed the Armenian soldiers, and killed them. Next they went after the intellectuals, clergy men, artists, poets, businessmen who had nothing to do with the army or had ever held a gun in their life! When the majority of grown men and teenage boys were gone, the women, children and old people were next. None of these people can be blamed for the lost of territory or of wars in the Balkans, Gallipoli or the Caucasus. As you can see this ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù snowballed into a genocide. All it takes is a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thought to cause a genocide or any crime against humanity. The ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thinking was thought up by Enver Pasha and it spread to Taalat, Jemal and the rest of the Young Turk party members."},{"instruction":"f there is no atmosphere in space, why is it cold?","output":"The Sunüåû is about 150 million kilometers away from Earth, but we can feel its warmth every single day.

Time series models are not causal models but attempt to use patterns in the time series data to predict future events.

Signal VS Whatsapp, WhatsApp is the most popular communications app on the planet with over two billion users using it for messaging. Bought by Facebook in 2014, the service popularised the use of end-to-end encryption in day-to-day communications, introducing it as its default for messaging in 2016. To do so it Here‚Äôs why you should use Signal for any conversation where privacy matters ‚Äì even if that‚Äôs just giving your family the shared Disney+ password ‚Äì and why your friends should, too. 1. Signal has more up-to-date security features New security features come to Signal first. For example, Signal has had disappearing messages ‚Äì which are automatically deleted after a specified period of time ‚Äì since 2016 but the feature is still being tested with small numbers of WhatsApp users. Other mainstream and beta Signal features that WhatsApp users don‚Äôt have include view-oncemedia messages, encrypted profiles, an incognito keyboard switch for Android to keep Gboard from sending your typing history back to Google, and backups that don‚Äôt default to unencrypted storage in Google Drive or Apple iCloud. Signal also has a slightly broader range of clients, with a dedicated client for Linux desktop users ‚Äì likely to appeal to those in the security and data analysis fields, while WhatsApp directs them to its web app. 2. Signal is open source All of Signal‚Äôs source code is published for anyone to examine and use under a GPLv3 license for clients and an AGPLv3 license for the server. This means that you can see what‚Äôs going on inside it ‚Äì or, more usefully, rely on the specialist expertise of people who review the code and know exactly what they‚Äôre looking for. 3. Signal has less potential for hidden vulnerabilities aAs larger platform, WhatsApp is more inviting to malicious actors to start with, but the fact that its codebase is a proprietary closed box means that it may take longer for dangerous vulnerabilities to be detected. Any application can and eventually will suffer vulnerabilities ‚Äì Signal has resolved a few of its own. But WhatsApp‚Äôs closed-source code (beyond its use of the open Signal protocol) means that there are a lot of potential targets that remain unknown until they‚Äôre exploited. A particularly worrying example was a vulnerability in WhatsApp‚Äôs VoIP stack, used by intelligence agencies to inject spyware in 2019. 4. You can run your own Signal server (but probably shouldn‚Äôt) Another advantage of open source software is that you can play with it, if you‚Äôre that way inclined. You probably won‚Äôt want or need a Signal server of your own for either personal or business reasons. It‚Äôs designed as a mass communications platform and isn‚Äôt really intended to scale down, it‚Äôs a pain to build and there are currently no containerised versions for easy deployment. But if you‚Äôre technically minded, you can learn a lot about how a system functions by building a test instance and poking it with a stick. It‚Äôs non-trivial, but community guides are available to help users get a Signal server up and running and some interesting forks exist, including a decentralised messaging system. 5. How much can you trust Facebook? Perhaps the most compelling reason to use Signal is Facebook's long-standing lack of respect for its users' privacy. Facebook has an appalling history when it comes to data collection and handling, from the Cambridge Analytica affair to its practice of sharing data about users with phone manufacturers. It‚Äôs already proved that it can‚Äôt be trusted with WhatsApp user data that should, under EU law, have remained private. In 2017, European regulators took action against Facebook for sharing the WhatsApp users‚Äô phone numbers with its Facebook social network for advertising purposes. Firmly in breach of data protection regulations, it was an opt-out rather than opt-in system. Facebook had previously claimed such a mechanism would never be implemented. WhatsApp co-developer Brian Acton, who left Facebook in 2017 and went on to co-found the Signal Foundation with Marlinspike, has harshly criticised Facebook‚Äôs approach to privacy and revealed that Facebook coached him ‚Äúto explain that it would be really difficult to merge or blend data between [WhatsApp and Facebook]‚Äù when giving information to EU regulators in 2014. Facebook‚Äôs desire to insert adverts and commercial messaging into WhatsApp and potentially compromise its security prompted Acton to leave Facebook early, sacrificing some 850 million in stock in the process. Acton‚Äôs fellow WhatsApp dev, Jan Koum, also walked out on Facebook following reported disputes with the company over its efforts to weaken encryption. Mark Zuckerberg has since publicly supported end-to-end encryption, saying it will also be added to its Messenger app. Facebook was until recently still vacillating over plans to introduce adverts to WhatsApp, with the latest reports indicating that the plan has finally been scrapped. Although it's not clear what will eventually happen to the service when Facebook merges WhatsApp with Instagram messaging and Messenger."},{"instruction":"eard lot of gurus say go deep or go inside.

It is important to note that these are not necessarily the same things: just because you like a particular project does not mean you are qualified to do it. Planning and execution of the project The main activities that comprise of this phase of project development are: 1. Identifying a problem to be solved 2. Generating project requirements 3. Developing a computational model for the solution 4. Performing system analysis 5. Designing of the system 6. Implementing and Integrating the modules 7. Testing the solution 8. Documenting the project 9. Managing the project A detailed explanation of the above activities is given here: [LINKED_TEXT: Steps involved in planning and executing a final year project] [URL: http://www.getprojects.in/blogs/final-year-projects/steps-involved-in-planning-and-executing-a-final-year-project/] Documentation of the project It is extremely important that you document your work at every stage of your project. The best way to organize your writing is to keep a log book of all work in progress. Every thought and observation you have on your project should go into this book, along with notes of meetings with your supervisor, results, theoretical developments, calculations, everything. This log book will become an invaluable source of material when you come to write up your project in the final report. However, don‚Äôt wait until the end of the project to begin the process of formal documentation. Write a formal report on completion of each phase of the project. These reports will become an excellent basis for your final report. Management of the project One of them most important things you will learn when doing your project is the need to manage your time. Final Year Projects require a considerable amount of time. A project schedule is an indispensable tool: building it forces you into thinking about all the things you need to do, their inter-relationships, the time each will take, and what each one will be used for. In drawing up your project schedule, you may find it useful to use a standard project management tool (such as Microsoft Project). These tools make it easy to draw the schedule and to track your progress. However, they won‚Äôt do the planning for you, i.e. they can‚Äôt identify tasks, subtasks, effort, duration, etc. That‚Äôs something you have to do yourself."},{"instruction":"w is Sweden able to send almost no trash to a landfill?","output":"Sweden has a robust recycling program and recycles about 50% of its wastes; 49% is burned to generate electricity and only 1% goes to landfills.

It will take time but in the long run it's well worth it. Photography, can be very rewarding, especially of nature. Get yourself a good camera and find somewhere you can go to take pictures of natural things. Martial arts can be quite therapeutic. Find one that will suit you.

In today‚Äôs environment, a woman merely has to SUGGEST a man was improper with her to ruin his life, his career and bankrupt him. Men need to avoid putting themselves in situations where even the appearance of impropriety is possible are doing so for self preservation, as well as moral reasons. In my job, I am required to meet customers in their homes and businesses, but when I‚Äôm there, I make sure I‚Äôm on an authorized work order, I document the actions taken, and limit my inside work to the absolute minimum to get the job done. I would not, in today‚Äôs environment, meet a woman alone in a hotel room, or get into a car. Any meeting I‚Äôm going to have is going to be in a public place, with lots of people around and arrive/depart in our own vehicles. You‚Äôre probably going to reference Vice President Pence‚Äôs statements on the subject.

While you wouldn‚Äôt lick your own hands after applying lotion (which is what the cat will do when you pet her after applying lotion: she‚Äôll ingest some of it) you‚Äôre not going to get ALL of it on your cat‚Äôs fur - some of it your skin absorbs, plus the first ingredient in most hand and body lotion is water. Harmful ingredients (like propylene glycol) in lotion won‚Äôt be there in amounts to be seriously harmful to a cat, but a cat who grooms will end up ingesting some of it, which could lead to upset stomach or diarrhea, just like what would happen to you if you licked your own hands after using lotion, you weirdo :) So just limit your patting. A pat or two on kitty‚Äôs head is fine; slathering your hands in lotion and then giving an all-out belly rub or scritchy session is risky since a little lotion residue will end up in your cat‚Äôs mouth. Use lotion maybe at work away from the cat, or before bedtime since most cats won‚Äôt wake you up just to be petted, or use manicure gloves (100% cotton gloves just for this purpose, to keep the lotion on and not all over your sheets/clothes/pets)."},{"instruction":"What is anatexis in geology?","output":"Anatexis is a geological process in which rocks are partially or completely melted due to high temperatures and pressures. This process often occurs in the Earth's crust and is typically associated with the melting of metamorphic rocks, such as gneisses and schists. Anatexis can be triggered by a variety of factors, such as the introduction of heat from magma, the increase in pressure due to tectonic activity, or the addition of fluids that can lower the melting point of rocks. As the rocks melt, they may form new igneous rocks or become assimilated into existing magmas. Anatexis plays an important role in many geological processes, including the formation of mountain belts, the evolution of continental crust, and the development of ore deposits. It is also an important process in the formation of many types of igneous rocks, including granite and pegmatite."},{"instruction":"w much money can you make online?","output":"You may be interested in knowing the precise amount of money you can make with a blog before we discuss the ways you might earn money.

Do you bail out every time nasty winds blow around the stock market? If you did that you'd never get anywhere financially. Germany and Austrian Empire were actually some of rhe most open places for Jewish people after the Napoleonic wars ended. Jews were regular citizens and owned homes and businesses on an equal footing with Christians. By comparison in Czarist Russia they couldn't own land, enter professions, get fair legal trials etc. And they would get killed in waves of pograms. Germany was seen as enlightened and fair in comparison. Many Jews thought they could ‚Äúride it out\\" until it was too late. And it gets harder to move to a new country and culture as you get older and you would tend to try to wait it out. Many Jews who did get out got depressed in their new countries.

Then: it is easy to express in FOL that there is a path of fixed length n between A1 and A2, passing through n-1 fixed intermediate vertices B1=A1, B2, ‚Ä¶., Bn, Bn+1=A2;by existentially quantifying B2, ‚Ä¶ Bn, it is easy to express in FOL that there is some path of fixed length n between A1 and A2 (passing through non-specified intermediate vertices);by universally quantifying on A1 and A2 and by writing a disjunction on 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶n, it is easy to express that any two vertices of a graph can be connected by a path of maximal length n Now, this where the problem of expressing ‚ÄúG is connected‚Äù in FOL begins.

He came back with a long face. first of all, the BMW was a little faster in a straight line but neither car would be considered fast compared to the American muscle at that time. But the Fiat handled far better than the BMW which tilted over scary in turns. Road and track wrote if you put a dime on the apex of a turn, you could nick it with the outside of the tire with a Fiat 124 sport 10 out of 10 times. there was an industrial area near my office. There was a railroad track that it‚Äôs sunken about nine or 10 inches below the tarmac. All the cars when approaching it at the slow down to a walk. I could hit it at full throttle and that would deep into the depression, pop out without any additional bouncing and continue on its way. We traded in the BMW and lost control of the car that speed which was about 30 miles an hour. Finally, my favorite thing to do was to race sports cars through the deserted streets near Lincoln Park zoo after a heavy snowstorm. You could slide the corners full throttle in the fiat in the snow and blast out! All three were trouble free for the first 50,000 miles. Then the Burton coop turned to rushed. All three were trouble free for the first 50,000 miles. Then the Bertone coupe turned to rust. For comparison, some of the cars I‚Äôve owned since then were all the different Nissan Z cars, Corvette, 9/11 whale tail Carrera, seven series BMW, plenty of Cadillacs, two different Mercedes-Benz including a big motor model that‚Äôs my second favorite car, but the Fiat coupe remains my favorite car of all time because it was the most fun.

It covers a variety of topics.https://scfacts190511.blogspot.com/search/label/maths?&max-results=5] [URL: https://scfacts190511.blogspot.com/search/label/maths?max-results=5]Yes, we can solve the equation 8x¬≥ - 6x - 1 = 0 using Cardano's method. Here are the steps: We start by making a change of variable to eliminate the quadratic term. Let x = y - 2/3b. Substituting this into the equation, we get: 8(y - 2/3b)¬≥ - 6(y - 2/3b) - 1 = 0 Expanding and simplifying, we get: 8y¬≥ - 36by¬≤ + 48b¬≤y - 27b¬≥ - 6y + 4b = 0 We now look for a value of p such that the equation can be written in the form: y¬≥ + py = q where q and p are constants. We can see that p = -6/8 = -3/4. Substituting this into the equation, we get: y¬≥ - 3/4y = -1/8 We now need to find the values of u and v such that: u¬≥ = -q/2 + sqrt(q¬≤/4 + p¬≥/27) v¬≥ = -q/2 - sqrt(q¬≤/4 + p¬≥/27) where sqrt denotes the square root function. Substituting the values of p and q, we get: u¬≥ = 27/8 + sqrt(729/64 + 27/64) v¬≥ = 27/8 - sqrt(729/64 + 27/64) Simplifying, we get: u¬≥ = 9 + 3sqrt(3) v¬≥ = 9 - 3sqrt(3) We can now solve for y by using the formulas: y = u^(1/3) + v^(1/3) where u and v are the values obtained in step 3. Substituting the values of u and v, we get: y = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) Finally, we can solve for x by using the formula: x = y - 2/3b where b is the coefficient of the quadratic term in the original equation. Substituting the value of y and the value of b = -6/8 = -3/4, we get: x = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) - 1/2 Therefore, the solution to the equation 8x¬≥ - 6x - 1 = 0 by Cardano's method is: x = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) - 1/2"},{"instruction":"What do I need to know about the University of Toronto?","output":"Find a group of like minded friends who you can hang out with.

It has a lot to offer to any tourist. After a week long stay my last place to visit was the East Side Gallery, East Berlin. The remains of the Berlin wall are here and are spread across a mile distance. The entire stretch has around 100 graffitis painted by various artists across the globe. What grabs ones' attention is the Kiss of Death at the end of the wall. The caption of the painting says: ‚ÄúGod help me to survive this deadly love affair.‚Äù Image Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Google] [URL: https://www.google.co.in/search?safe=off&biw=1337&bih=586&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=k_lSW5vdIsvQrQGq1Kq4Bw&q=kiss%20of%20death%2Bberlin%20wall&oq=kiss%20of%20death%2Bberlin%20wall&gs_l=img.3...3459.6165.0.6667.12.12.0.0.0.0.192.1549.0j12.12.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.2.266...0i30k1.0.V39-H3bou_o#imgrc%3D_] Well this image has got nothing to do with the same gender love or even just love for that matter. However the misconception was brought to my notice because I heard the fellow travellers say - Oh they appreciated same gender love back then. But, it's not any passionate kiss at all. Apparently the visitors had no idea who the two famous men in that graffiti were. This was painted by a Soviet artist called Dmitri Vrubel. This is based on a real image from 1979 in honor of the thirtieth anniversary of the German Democratic Republic‚ÄìEast Germany. and was painted in 1989. The Kiss depicts Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev giving the East Germany President Erich Honecker what appears to be a passionate kiss on the lips.

A few websites quoted this back in earlier days as ‚ÄúBoth Honecker and Brezhnev were a little more enthusiastic than your average Communist dictator in kissing.‚Äù also mentioned a popular joke in which Brezhnev supposedly makes this observation about Honecker: ‚ÄúAs a politician, rubbish‚Ä¶but what a good kisser!‚Äù So this ain't any passionate kiss, it was a fraternal kiss between two social dictators.

Hence the need for an [LINKED_TEXT: Automated Business Accounting] [URL: https://www.enkash.com/resources/blog/why-choose-automated-account-payable-platform/] solution.

Raising the invoice requires multiple inputs, from calculations to costs and customer criteria. Manually, these take a long time. With automatic transactions, time and effort can be saved greatly while minimizing invoice error completely. The second most crucial advantage of automated business accounting is double-layered security. Traditional accounting through a ledger system can be lost, stolen, or fall into the wrong hands. Digital accounting stores all the relevant data in a secured cloud-based system that cannot be accessed or breached without permission. The centralized system is foolproof. The third crucial advantage of Automated Business Accounting is the complete transparency in operations. The electronic documentation maintains a detailed digital footprint of the cash flow going into the Financial system. The real-time details of the contact point and sources are all automatically fed into the data storage. It can be accessed anytime and from anywhere through the appropriate authorization. The detailed cash flow structure allows the business development team to analyze and create strategic planning to help direct the flow of funds based on the expenditures and returns generated.

Yes, we have the human time, we as humans have set, where you have to study till 25‚Äì26, start earning after that, then marry around 28‚Äì36, have a family. Bring the kids up, and then go behind the curtains when time comes. So, in this schedule, we have to start attaining success starting from 28‚Äì30, at least by 45‚Äì55. I was very much in this mode 10 years back. I was, totally. Now my concept is different. Think of each human life as a bud, opening one petal at a time. Some particular species open very fast and attract bees (metaphor for success) fast. Some open very slowly taking as long as it needs, taking their own sweet time. But every bud opens, not at the schedule of the human time, but at the schedule of the divine time. The opening of the flower, is actually 'opening of the awareness'. In Hinduism, it is considered the 1000 petal lotus on the crown of the head called, 'Sahasrara'. To really open our eyes with awareness. So, what I am implying is, every one is one our own journey, our own time, our own schedule. Some get success fast, some later, some never. Some earlier, some late in life. Every thing is okay, fine, as long as we are learning, progressing in our soul growth. In this way of perspective, suddenly we are not rushing, we are not in the rat race to achieve success. We are not competing. We are concentrated on our own life, our own soul growth, but always giving others a helping hand, a slight push of encouragement. So, every thing is okay. Every one is on their own journey. The most important thing is the progress of the soul, and the person to become the very best and highest version of themselves, as per their own perspective.

Religions are just ways of life with same motive and preachings which are modified by us to create friction within the society. Now coming to the answer.. First of all it is not at all true the PM Modi celebrates only Hindu festivals and not those of other religions as mentioned in previous answers, he never misses congratulating people from other religions also on specific occasions.Now, consider this, though he is the PM he is also a citizen of our secular country(where secular actually means nothing to do with any religion instead what is usually considered as equality to all religions). So, he has all the rights to celebrate any religion any festival which he may like. Except it is his moral duty and not any constitutional boundation to show involvement and attachment to other religions also.PM Modi is Hindu, and i guess everyone is aware of that fact, So being a Hindu it is quiet obvious that he will be inclined to Hindu Rituals and traditions more than any other religion.Being a secular country doesn‚Äôt mean that the PM of that country has to leave his own religion."},{"instruction":"want to start a diet but I can never go by the diet. I always eat more. How can I keep going along with my diet?","output":"Most diets are designed to lose weight over the short term and have a focus on weight and not holistic health‚Äîas in nutrition and disease prevention/healing through whole plant foods. Consequently, most diets use caloric restriction and just eating less of the food that naturally leads to weight gain. Which will lead your body craving and needing more. Now, a caloric deficit is necessary to lose weight. Yet one can and ideally achieves this through actually eating more! The key to losing weight isn‚Äôt eating less, but actually eating MORE of the right foods. vegetarians, especially vegans, have consistently shown to have lower and normal BMI‚Äôs compared to omnivores or pescatarians for the main reason that they eat more fruits and vegetables which are naturally low in calories. By eating more fruits and vegetables you can eat more, fill up your stomach, and satisfy your hunger and nutritional needs, while still reaching your weight goals. a clear strategy can give us our best results. But diets often fail because they are meant to. When trying to maintain our weight it is best to approach it from an education and holistic health mindset then trying to punish ourselves just to lose a few pounds at any consequence.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"It's a common belief that private schools are better than public schools. But is this actually true? Let's take a closer look. One significant difference between private and public schools is funding. Private schools are typically funded by tuition payments and donations, while taxpayers fund public schools. This can lead to some significant differences in resources. For example, private schools often have smaller class sizes than public schools. They may also have more money to spend on new technology and extracurricular activities. But private schools aren't always better than public schools. It depends on the individual school and what its priorities are. Some public schools may have just as good (or even better) resources as private schools. It's also important to remember that private schools aren't necessarily more expensive than public schools. There are many affordable private schools out there.

Listening to 60s pop/rock I'm impressed by how many instruments seem to fit into the mix compared to when I use synths in a DAW.","output":"Although there are real differences between the way that acoustic instruments sound compared to synthesized instruments, I suspect that what you are hearing is not because of this difference. A skilled engineer works very hard to get a lot of instruments to ‚Äúfit‚Äù into a mix, and there are a lot of techniques that can be used to do this. What you are hearing is the engineers‚Äô mixing skills in the music you are listening to. A few things that you can try in order to get more instruments to fit in your mixes: when you use equalization (EQ), it is better to cut frequencies from one track that is stomping on another, than to boost frequencies on a track that is getting lost.panning is a vital part of differentiating tracks‚Äînever place two similar-sounding tracks at the same pan position. Using your pan control, place everything in a distinct position.If used minimally, you can carefully use different-sounding reverbs (or delays) to differentiate two tracks. The ear can easily tell that they sound like the two tracks are in different places, just because of the reverb that is added to the sounds. When this is overdone, it ruins a mix, though‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want it to sound like every single sound in a mix is coming from a different place.when setting up the entire mix, think very carefully about what frequency ranges each track sits in. In some cases, it‚Äôs alright for a track to occupy the same frequency range as another, e.g. bass guitar and kick drum. But in other cases you will want to carefully work to differentiate two different tracks, using EQ, panning, and/or reverb. There‚Äôs a lot more that you can do, but this is the simple stuff.

You can learn a few things, but you won‚Äôt really be doing it to an acceptable standard unless you play with other people who are better at it than you are. Nothing, and I mean nothing, forces a person to learn how to play, more efficiently and more thoroughly than the experience of trying to keep up with better players. I‚Äôm not saying that you have to sign up for a course of expensive lessons with a teacher, just that if you want to learn to play jazz, you learn it best by‚Äîyes, indeed‚Äîfirst obtaining a solid foundation of how the theory becomes practice through self-study, woodshedding, exercises and learning as many tunes as possible, but if you don‚Äôt then go out and play it with others, you‚Äôre just someone noodling in your bedroom. It‚Äôs not just a matter of knowing the notes and learning the tunes and lots of scales and lots of chords and practising lots of licks. It‚Äôs about communicating with all that knowledge, and I firmly believe that we only learn that from seeing up close how other, better players communicate, and allowing ourselves to be blown away and intimidated and even humiliated by how much better they are than we are. By all means go off and teach yourself the language, but bear in mind that we only learn to speak with authority once we know what it‚Äôs like to hear someone else do it. And I don‚Äôt think we really learn what that‚Äôs like from recordings. It‚Äôs much too easy to treat recordings as if they were simply examples of the kind of thing we could do: harder to hear them as if they‚Äôre someone talking to us. One way of doing this is to sit down and really listen to something‚Äînot to remind yourself of what it‚Äôs like, but to pretend, for example, that you‚Äôre never going to be able to listen to it ever again. Pretend it‚Äôs the last time you will ever hear X play Y. Imagine how hard you would listen. Seeing a good player play live, delivers you that experience without you having to pretend anything. Of course, I realise that it‚Äôs next to impossible to play with others when there‚Äôs a goddamn pandemic raging outside. I haven‚Äôt played with anyone since January 2020.

The most well-known and commonly observed satellites are those of the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is the largest artificial satellite in orbit, and it reflects sunlight, making it visible as a bright moving object in the night sky. The ISS can appear as bright as or even brighter than the planet Venus and can be seen under favorable conditions. Apart from the ISS, there are other satellites, such as the Iridium communication satellites, that can produce brief, intense flares of light known as Iridium flares. These flares occur when the satellites' reflective surfaces align with the Sun and an observer on Earth, creating a sudden and dramatic increase in brightness that can be visible for a few seconds. Additionally, there are many other satellites that can be seen under certain conditions, such as those in low Earth orbit (LEO) and with the right timing. Some examples include satellites from the Starlink constellation, which aims to provide global broadband coverage, and other communication and observation satellites. To observe satellites, it is best to find a location with minimal light pollution, look for passes of the ISS or other satellites using online tools or mobile apps, and be patient as you track their movement across the sky. http://aianditsnewimpact.blogspot.com/2023/03/AI%20and%20its%20new%20impect.html"},{"instruction":"What are interesting facts that everyone should know about India's Mangalyaan?","output":"ISRO has taken just 18 months in building its rocket, its space craft, instruments and readying its tracking system at Byalalu near Bangalore. Mission Objectives: One of the main objectives of the mission to Mars is to develop the technologies required for design, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission. Technological Objectives: Design and realisation of a Mars orbiter with a capability to survive and perform Earth bound manoeuvres, cruise phase of 300 days, Mars orbit insertion/ capture, and on-orbit phase around Mars. Deep space communication, navigation, mission planning and management. Incorporate autonomous features to handle contingency situations. Scientific Objectives: Exploration of Mars surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere by indigenous scientific instruments Mars Orbiter Mission carries five payloads: For atmpospheric studies: Layman Alpha Photometer (LAP): It is an absorption cell photometer. It measures the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from Lyman-alpha emission in the Martian upper atmosphere (typically Exosphere and exobase). Measurement of D/H (Deuterium to Hydrogen abundance ratio) allows us to understand especially the loss process of water from the planet. Methan Sensors for Mars (MSM): It is designed to measure methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere with PPB accuracy and map its source. Data is acquired only over illuminated scene as the sensor measures the reflected solar radiation. Methane concentration in the MArtian atmosphere undergoes spatial and temporal variations. For particle environment studies: Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA): It is a quadruple mass spectrometer capable of analysing the neutral composition in the range of 1 to 300 amu with unit mass resolution. The heritage of this payload is from Chandra's Altitudinal Composition Explorer (CHACE) payload. For surface imaging studies: Mars Colour Camera (MCC): This tri-colour camera gives images and information about the surface mission and composition of Maritan surface. They are useful to monitor the dynamic evenst and weather of Mars. MCC will also be used for ptobing the two satellites of Mars - Phobos and Deimos. It also provides the context information for other science payloads. Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS): This will measure the thermal emission and can be be operated during both day and night. Temperature and emissivity are the two basic physical parameters estimated from thermal emission measurement. Many minerals and soil types have characteristic spectra in TIR region. TIC can map surface composition and mineralogy of Mars. 10 facts: Mangalyaan, which means \\"Mars craft\\" in Hindi is scheduled to lift off at 2:38 pm from Sriharikota, 80 kilometres from Chennai. ([LINKED_TEXT: Full coverage] [URL: http://www.ndtv.com/mars])India will attempt to become only the fourth country or group of countries to reach the Red Planet, after the Soviet Union, United States and Europe.This is India's first Mars mission, and no country has been fully successful on its first try. More than half the world's attempts to reach Mars - 23 out of 40 missions - have failed, including missions by Japan in 1999 and China in 2011.An evolved version of India's domestically developed Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, with extended rockets, will take Mangalyaan into an elliptical arc around the Earth. The satellite's thrusters will then begin a series of six small fuel burns, moving it into higher orbit before it slingshots toward the Red Planet.Mangalyaan has a formidable itinerary: a 300-day, 780 million-kilometre (485 million-mile) journey to orbit Mars and survey its geology and atmosphere.At its closest point it will be 365 kilometres (227 miles) from the planet's surface, and at its furthest - 80,000 kilometres (49,700 miles).Five solar-powered instruments aboard Mangalyaan will gather data to help determine how Martian weather systems work and what happened to the water that is believed to have once existed on Mars in large quantities.Mangalyaan will also search Mars for methane, a key chemical in life processes on Earth that could also come from geological processes.None of the instruments will send back enough data to answer these questions definitively, but experts say the data are key to better understanding how planets develop geologically, what conditions might make life possible and where else in the universe it might exist.In 2008-09, the Indian Space and Research Organisation successfully launched a lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, which discovered evidence of water on the moon. Mangalyaan was developed from technology tested during the Chandrayaan mission. About the launch:India has launched its first mission to Mars on Tuesday at 02:38pm (0908 GMT) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre here in Andhra Pradesh. The spacecraft was carried onboard the indigenous PSLV-C25 rocket which injected it into Earth's orbit after 40 minutes from lift-off. The Mars Orbiter Mission, informally known as \\"Mangalyaan\\", was announced 15 months ago by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh shortly after a Chinese probe flopped when it failed to leave earth's atmosphere. The timing led to speculation that India was seeking to make a point to its militarily and economically superior neighbour, despite denials from ISRO. The 350-tonne launch vehicle will orbit earth for nearly a month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. Only then will it begin the second stage of its nine-month journey which will test India's scientists to the full, five years after they sent a probe called Chandrayaan to the moon. More than half of all Mars projects have failed, including China's in 2011 and Japan's in 2003. Only the United States, Russia and the European Union have successfully reached there. The total cost of the project is just 4.5 billion rupees (73 million), a fraction of foreign equivalents. There have been recent setbacks for India, however, including when Chandrayaan lost contact with its controllers in 2009 and when a new larger launch vehicle blew up after take-off in 2010. India has never before attempted an inter-planetary journey which has required the development of technology enabling the probe to run autonomously. Communication signals take 12 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars. \\"The biggest problem is to understand the navigation issue from the earth's orbit to the Martian orbit,\\" ISRO chief Radhakrishnan said. ISRO said that its technology has helped with economic development through satellites which monitor weather and water resources, or enable communication in remote parts of the country. Lacking the power to fly directly, the 350-tonne launch vehicle will orbit Earth for nearly a month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. Only then will it begin the second stage of its nine-month journey which will test India's scientists to the full, five years after they sent a probe called Chandrayaan to the moon. More than half of all Mars projects have failed, including China's in 2011 and Japan's in 2003. Only the United States, Russia and the European Union have successfully reached there. The total cost of the project is 450 crores, one sixth of the cost of a Mars probe set to be launched by NASA in 13 days. The 1,350-kilogram unmanned orbiter must travel 485 million miles over 300 days to reach the red planet.The Mars Orbiter is expected to reach Mars' orbit on September 14, 2014.

What actions does it perform to do that?","output":"Today we rarely process sound in its natural acoustic form. A car‚Äôs muffler is a true sound processor: it is a low pass filter, absorbing most of the high pitch sounds and outputting only the low frequencies, including of course the engine exhaust gasses. Most of our sound processing is performed electronically on signals that are not sound anymore. The original sound is converted to a sequence of numbers stored in a computer. If the sound is sampled sufficiently fast (say 40,000 times a second), and those samples are stored as digital numbers, each number representing the amplitude of the sound at that sampling instance and we have a reliable representation of the sound stored in memory as a a time-series of numbers. Now can can process the numbers, using a procedure called digital signal processing (DSP). Suppose we want the sound level to be one half the amplitude of what we have recorded, i.e. to adjust the volume down by a factor of 2. All we do is multiply each of those numbers by 0.5. This is a simple computing task. Signal processors can do much more. They can enhance sound frequency range (bass or treble adjustment) or we can add echo by adding the current stream of number to its own version that is delayed in time. Basically, almost any operation you can describe mathematically can be done by DSP. Once we finished the processing, we convert the numbers back to electric signals that feed amplifiers that drive the loudspeaker that makes it sound again."},{"instruction":"Why are people quitting sugar or just antisugar in general?","output":"Because refined sugar is full of calories and little else."},{"instruction":"w did algorithms predicting Hillary Clinton‚Äôs landslide victory in the 2016 Presidential Election get their prediction so wrong?","output":"The polls were not wrong.

There are certain plant foods containing significantly more protein than others. Which may promote muscle strength, satiety and weight loss. Varieties of health and protein supplements are available in the market which claims to build your muscles while going to gym. But the only question is should we consume these supplements available in the market ? The answer is NO. In my personal opinion, as long as protein source is available naturally from pulses, grains and vegetables, we should avoid taking unnatural health & protein supplements. Anyone who is focusing on gaining some muscles and losing fat at the same time must consider including Soya beans and Bengal gram/Chickpea/Chana to their daily diet. Now, you may ask why to suggest including beans to diet? Because beans contain a high amount of plant protein per serving which is also an excellent source of complex carbs, fiber, iron, folate, Omega-3, Omega-6 fatty acids, phosphorus, potassium, manganese and several beneficial plant compounds. Furthermore, several studies show that a diet rich in beans and other legumes can decrease cholesterol, help control blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure and even reduce belly fat. Only 25 grams of soya bean in our regular diet can improve our overall health, reduce chances of heart related ailments and strengthen our defense mechanism Soya beans naturally are reservoirs of nutrition. Because, It contain, 1) Proteins - 35-40% 2) Oil - 20% 3) Carbohydrates - 22% 4) Minerals - 5% 5) Fiber - 3.4 % 6) Moisture - 9-10% ‚ÄúSoya dal has double the protein as compared to other dals‚Äù Soybean is a wonderful substitute for meat - for regular meat eaters, substituting a portion of your meat intake with soybean will provide you plenty of protein - almost thrice of the protein in eggs! The nutrient density in Soy makes it a superhero food. Soybean, over the years, have gained an inauspicious reputation of being difficult on the stomach (mainly due to the abundance of protein in them as well as) due to the presence of 'antinutrients'. What are these antinutrients? These are compounds that do not let our body absorb vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients. However, there are easy ways of destroying these compounds like soaking the beans in water, blanching and cooking, fermenting, roasting, sprouting them etc. (Similar to other high protein beans like Rajma, Chickpeas etc. which are soaked overnight usually before they are cooked well until they become soft and mushy.) Soybean being such nutritional legume is getting compromised with the introduction of GMO seeds into the market. One of the most trusted brands who is practicing organic farming, following all the holistic approach in bringing the balance between the farm and ecosystem is Two Brothers Organic Farmers. TBOF is an organic certified farm by ECOCERT. They are growing heirloom seeds on their farm, Heirloom seeds are those that have come into being, through a natural process of open pollination, have evolved in a specific region over time, some over 50 years or more. They have been passed down generations. The [LINKED_TEXT: Soybean grown on TBOF farms] [URL: https://twobrothersindiashop.com/collections/all/products/whole-soya-beans-high-protein-1kg] is of this heirloom variety only, which is first soaked into water for 3-4 hrs. until enlarged, blanching is done in boiling water and sun dried.

We call those pages [LINKED_TEXT: cornerstone content] [URL: https://yoast.com/what-is-cornerstone-content/]. Secondly, you should tidy up pages that aren‚Äôt getting many (if any) internal links.

As a person who lives alone, and a full-time foodie, I‚Äôm not afraid to admit that I‚Äôve only cooked only a handful of times in the last two years. I obviously didn‚Äôt intentionally think of putting down the knives, the idea of picking up my phone for food just happened when I moved out for work. I mean, what else do you expect from people who never cook? And then there was a sudden rise of delivery giants such as Swiggy and Zomato ‚Äî enabling instant delivery of anything I would want to eat, from any restaurant I‚Äôd want to eat + those mouthwatering discounts. LOL. Suddenly, with these platforms, I had the access to over 370+ restaurants delivering almost any food item I could desire. Heaven? No Heaven On-Demand! With the rise of on-demand food delivery restaurants such as Swiggy, Zomato and Gatoes, people are switching from going out the conventional way to restaurants ‚Äî to various on-demand food delivery services, thus making it a lot more evident that this industry is here to stay. And with the onset of COVID-19, everything changed overnight. People learnt how beneficial on-demand grocery delivery could be. Now you must be wondering how these platforms are able to make it big? The answer is pretty simple. On-Demand Food Delivery is: Accessible: It allows users to order food from any restaurant of their choice without having to trade of their work routine.Convenient: It solves the equation of food demand and supply in a truly unmatched way.Speed: It takes not more than 15 to 50 minutes for the food to arrive when any customer orders it with an on-demand app.Cost-efficient: These platforms are cost-efficient for both the restaurant and the restaurant owners, as none of them has to worry about transportation.Offers and Promotions: It turns out that catching customer‚Äôs attention is not at all difficult with the help of offers and promotions.Simple: And the best thing about these platforms is they are simple. Everything and anything could be done here with a simple click. And when it comes to revenue. I‚Äôd like to give you an example of Gatoes. It is a food delivery app operating in J&K. Launched in early 2020, Gatoes managed to earn a revenue of more than 1 Crore in just 3 months post-launch. Yes, 3 Crores, in 3 months, that too when it was solely operating in a harsh place like Kashmir.

These events allow investors to buy into a new cryptocurrency at a lower price, and if the project is successful, the value of the cryptocurrency may rise, allowing investors to sell their tokens for a profit. In addition to ICOs, some cryptocurrency exchanges like MXC list coins early, which can give investors the opportunity to buy into a new project before it becomes widely available. However, investing in new projects also carries significant risks, as there is often limited information available about the project and its prospects for success. Another potential way to make money from cryptocurrency investments is through staking. Staking involves holding a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in a wallet or on an exchange, which allows you to participate in the network and earn rewards in the form of additional tokens. Some projects, like Stader, offer their own native token (in this case, SD) that can be earned through staking or other means. These tokens can potentially appreciate in value, allowing investors to make money from their investment. In summary, investing in cryptocurrencies can potentially be lucrative, but it also carries significant risks. Investors should carefully consider their individual investment goals and risk tolerance before investing in any cryptocurrency, and should do thorough research to understand the risks and potential rewards of any investment. MEXC is a an exchange that lists a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Stader's native token SD, as well as many other popular coins, but it's important to remember that any investment in cryptocurrency comes with risks that should be carefully considered."},{"instruction":"f the receiver of the CCTV camera is off, does it still record?","output":"Depend on how camera system is set up.

And how can you do that? You can make the best of trading by following some golden rules of intraday trading. Let us quickly have a look at some of them. ‚ÄúTime is money‚Äù and this goes very well with intraday trading. Intraday trading is making more profits in a shorter period. Not just a minute but even a second can cause a difference when you are practicing intraday trading. It is therefore important that you choose the best time frame for intraday trading. The early one hour, which is from 9:30 AM-10:30 AM, is considered the best time for intraday trading. You may ask, why? Now in intraday trading, you need to play with high volatility, so during the early hours, the volatility is high in the market. Not just that, the liquidity is also high, which means that you can easily enter and exit the stocks thus making better profits. It is also the time when the stocks are reacting to the news of the previous night or early morning. So, you need to keep an eye on the market as well. Suppose there is a company ABC and after the market hours on Tuesday, they announced a change in their management. Now, this can impact the stock movement and price the next day. Now other than taking the position, it is also important to consider square-off your position at the right time. If you are having an account with Choice then square off the position by 3:15 PM to avoid losses or any kind of penalty. It is all about picking the right stock when it comes to intraday trading. So, you need to be extra cautious when you are picking the stocks for intraday trading. You need to focus on some key aspects when you are choosing stocks for intraday trading. The factors are as follows: You should choose volatile stocks. Look for stocks that have medium volatility so that you can make good profits. Imagine a stock that fluctuates only 1-2% in a day as compared to stocks that can move at least 10-12%. You will be able to make better profits on the latter.It is important that you focus on the liquidity of the stock as well. If there is no demand for the stock, it can get quite difficult for you to enter or exit the stock.Conduct a proper technical analysis of the stock. Using technical indicators and intraday trading strategies can not only help you in picking the right stock but also help you determine the right entry and exit points.Keep an eye on the news and the stocks that have the potential to reach the same.Study the market trends, so that you can actively ride the tide and make profits out of the same. Define your Risk and Targets Too much greed in real life and intraday trading will not lead you to great results. You need to define your targets before you enter trading of the stock. Suppose you purchased a stock for ‚Çπ100, and currently it is trading at ‚Çπ120. But rather than, selling it off at the same moment, you decide to wait for another 15 minutes. Unfortunately, the stock prices move down to ‚Çπ115 the very next movement and then never climb the ladder. In this case, instead of making a profit of ‚Çπ20 per stock, you just made ‚Çπ15. It is, therefore, crucial to know when to exit. Not only this, but you should also know what is your risk appetite. Every trader has a different risk appetite depending on the capital that is invested, the financial goals, and many such factors. Since the market is very volatile in intraday trading, you need to put and use stop-loss in intraday trading, for every trade. It helps you decide on an exit point and also minimizes your risk even if the market works against you. Make Use of The Margin Facility Margin trading is a boon for intraday trading. It gives you the advantage of trading with money that you don‚Äôt have. Your stockbroker gives you an extra amount to trade. Now there is a lot of advantage to trading using margin. Suppose you have ‚Çπ5000, and you want to buy shares worth ‚Çπ100/each. On the same day, you sold all of the shares at ‚Çπ130/share, thus making a profit of ‚Çπ1,500. If you would have traded the same shares at the margin, then your trading amount would have been ‚Çπ25,000. In this case, the profit would have been ‚Çπ7500. It is therefore great to use the margin trading facility. However, it is also important not to rely completely on the margin trading facility. This is because if the market works against you, there can be massive losses as well. However, there has been a change in the margin recently. Let us have a look at the new margin rules. Initially, the stockbrokers used to provide margins to their clients based on their will. The margin used to be as high as 40X-50X as well. But recently SEBI introduced their new margin rules. So, according to these rules, from the 1st of December,2020, with every quarter the margin was set to decrease by 25%. 1st December 2020- 25% less1st March 2021- 50% less1st June 2021- 75% less1st September 2021- No margin So, now the stockbrokers are allowed to give a maximum of 5X margin. This has caused a lot of intraday traders to trade with less capital and thus generate lesser profits. Now after this rule most traders look for a way how to do intraday trading without margin? It can be done with the capital available to you, but make sure that the fund you use for trading is enough to generate profit in intraday trading. Guard your Emotions It is a common sight that a lot of people start trading with the research tips of known ones or just random ones that they hear. It is possible that the stocks that generated the profits for someone else, might turn out to be a flop show for you. Also, if the market is moving against the grain, then a lot of traders tend to panic and sell their positions. This can cause them to book losses. It is therefore important to guard your emotions when you are trading in the stock market and do your analysis before you make any major trading decisions.

(*): Farming in the region depended on irrigation from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers( the two rivers b/w which the lucky city lied).When irrigation water is allowed to evaporate in the fields, it leaves behind mineral salts. These mineral salts become highly poisonous for the plants. It irrigation water is drained, erosion occurs. Therivers were higher than the surrounding plain because of built-up silt in the river beds, so water for irrigation flowed into the fields by gravity. Once the water was on the fields, it could not readily drain away because the fields were lower than the river. As the water evaporated, it not only left its dissolved mineral salts behind, but also drew salts upward from lower levels of the soil. By 2300 BC, agricultural economy of the Mesopotamians began to shatter as the soil could no longer support plants. 2.Overpopulated and polluted city:Some say that there was overcrowding which subsequently led to pollution along with other reasons like war and changes in the environment. Mesopotamian cities also had major pollution problems. Lack of indoor toilets and ineffective garbage collection led to contaminated water supplies and frequent epidemics such as Typhus. 3.Wars:In 2000 BC, the last Sumerian dynasty fell and for almost a century, Mesopotamia was a place of chaos and confusion. In 1900 BC, Amorites captured the region and centralised the government over various city states. Finally, it was the invasion of Hittites which marked the end of Old Babylonian Empire in Mesopotamia during 1900 BC to 1600 BC. Now, Let me briefly give u the sequence of events that led to present-day crisis in Iraq: 1.World War I:Iraq was under the control of the strong Ottoman Empire(Turks).The Ottoman Empire was aligned with Germany and Austria against England, France, Italy, and Russia in a clash of empires.. The defeat of the Ottoman Empire meant the British and French took large parts of the conquered region to administer for themselves. The British turned the new state into a kingdom, and placed on the throne, Faisal, who had fought alongside T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) when that charismatic gentleman had led an Arab rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in favor of Britain. Faisal's rule was oppressive especially to the Shiite population which was given little say in the government. 2.Birth of Baathist party:Iraq gained its independence from Great Britain in 1932. But in the 1930s two dissident parties formed, the Communists and the Baathists. The communist influence came out of the Soviet Union. The Baathist party was a fascist organization very much along the lines of Hitler's Nazis. A young Saddam Hussein was part of the resistance. He participated in a failed assassination attempt on General Qassem. But the Baathists finally succeeded in overthrowing Qassem's government in 1963, instituting a blood bath of human destruction in an attempt to secure their political victory. Even so, the Baathists still faced opposition from the Communists who led a successful counter-coup that was just as violent and vicious as that of the Baathists. 3.Rise of Saddam hussain:The communist regime in Iraq was also discredited by the defeat against Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.. The Baath party stepped up with yet another coup in 1968. The new leader was Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr.Saddam Hussein was a member of al-Bakr's staff, serving as chief administrative assistant and head of the secret police. In this position he filled important posts with his own [LINKED_TEXT: cronies.By] [URL: http://cronies.by/] 1979 Saddam Hussein had gained enough power to ask al-Bakr to step down. During the 1980s, using primarily oil revenue, he built a formidable military force and amassed modern weapons, doing research into chemical and nuclear weapons. 4.Wars with Iran and Kuwait: Saddam stated his goal as surpassing even the United States, China, and the Soviet Union in world influence. To launch this brave new Iraq, Saddam Hussein ordered his army to invade Iran in 1980. This war became a brutal slug-fest that lasted eight years, mixing trench warfare with missiles, tanks and even chemical weapons. It was a war which cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Iraq, a nation of around 20 million could ill-afford the losses. The war also seriously depleted Iraq's capital reserves.In yet another aggressive move, in 1990 Saddam Hussein launched an attack on Kuwait largely in order to acquire that small country's oil reserves. He seems to have believed that, like Hitler's swift and well-nigh unopposed move into Austria prior to World War II, he could take Kuwait without any long-term opposition from the great powers. The [LINKED_TEXT: Gulf War] [URL: http://www.indepthinfo.com/iraq/index.shtml] in 1992 was the result. The United States and its allies launched an air campaign that tore apart the Iraqi command and control structure. The subsequent ground campaign quickly pushed Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. Although Iraq was soundly beaten, it was in effect a local victory for the allies, local to Kuwait. 5.Unstoppable Saddam: Saddam worked assiduously to build his military, and consolidate his hold on the country. There were many mass killings, concentration camps, torture chambers and prisons used against the Iraqi people. Estimates are that over 300,000 people were killed by the regime. Even children were imprisoned in harsh conditions to ensure the good behavior of their parents.All efforts by the U.N. to get Saddam Hussein to discontinue this process were met by a bureaucratic stone wall. To make matters worse, Saddam instituted a program where he paid the families of suicide bombers 10,000.00 to attack Israel. After an attack on U.S. soil by terrorists in 2001 at the Twin Towers and the U.S. Pentagon, the United States became very concerned about the possibility that Saddam Hussein's government was close to developing a super weapon that could be placed in the hands of terrorists.After many attempts by the U.N. to get Saddam to allow inspectors to do their job within Iraq, and an untold number of resolutions demanding he do so, the United States, Great Britain and several other allies decided to end the threat imposed by Saddam Hussein once and for all. Iraq itself was invaded. Iraqi forces were swiftly defeated in a textbook campaign by the allies. Saddam was deposed and captured, eventually to be tried and hung by a new Iraqi government. 6.Present Scenario:In subsequent years there was a degree of turmoil. A republican form of government was established. However, violence and division continued for some time within the state, probably because of the diverse ethnic groups within the population (especially the Sunni and Shiite Muslim sects) as well as the infiltration of foreign terrorists bent on destabilizing the regime. At the time of this writing this process is continuing with U.S. and coalition forces maintaining a strong presence within the country in an effort to bring stability to Iraq and by extension to the region which surrounds it...."},{"instruction":"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) worth watching if you found Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) to be plodding and maddeningly slowpaced?","output":"It has Ricardo Montalban in it.

Transductive learning assumes that even though we don't have the labels of the test set, we have some other information we can take advantage of information.

The phone carrier may be able to provide you with the call history for a specific phone number. However, they may require you to provide proof of ownership of the phone number before they will release the information.Use a third-party call tracking app. There are a number of third-party call tracking apps that can be used to track the call history of a mobile phone number. These apps typically require you to install the app on the phone you want to track. Once the app is installed, it will start recording the call history and uploading it to the cloud. You can then access the call history from any web browser. It is important to note that it is illegal to track someone's call history without their consent. If you are considering using a third-party call tracking app, it is important to make sure that you are in compliance with the law. Here are some additional things to keep in mind when trying to find the call history of a mobile phone number: The phone carrier may only keep call history records for a certain period of time. This period of time may vary depending on the phone carrier.The call history may not be complete. The phone carrier may not record all calls, or they may only record calls that meet certain criteria (such as calls that are made or received outside of the country).The call history may not be accurate.

Unpacking and cleaning was an ongoing project, and one day I was vacuuming under the couch cushions and found a sock. It was a Christmas sock, so it was obviously not his and had obviously been there for months or even years when an ex-girlfriend or niece must have lost it. Luckily for my husband this set the stage for what I found next . . . One day I decided to vacuum under the bed. I found a pair of underwear, a pair of pink panties that were not mine. Based on the size we figured out which ex-girlfriend they belonged to. Luckily for him, I trust him and understand that he never cleaned under his bed.

The previous weekend, we were visiting his parents for a family function, which included his two small nieces and a hot tub. Sure enough, when he called his sister-in-law later, she confirmed that one of the kids changed for the hot tub and asked what to do with her underwear.

Going in order, JFK's father, Joseph Kennedy, carefully curated his public image as a family man, but behind closed doors, he was a prolific womanizer who didn't bother to hide his affairs from his family. As a father, I'm sometimes surprised at how many meaningless (to me) things that I do/say ultimately resonate with my children, but there's no mystery about the Kennedy household: the boys were taught that they didn't owe their wives faithfulness and that they could do whatever they wanted in their private lives as long as they were sufficiently careful to maintain public appearances. As a child growing up in such an environment, JFK was likely to go in one of two directions: either he would reject his father's behavior or imitate it. He obviously went with door #2. And second, I'm reminded of an old Norm Mcdonald joke about Tiger Woods; the punchline was that given the hundreds of opportunities he had to cheat every day, he was actually a pretty good husband in comparison to the average guy who might have 5 chances to cheat in his lifetime. Now obviously, JFK was not anyone's idea of a model husband, but he did have women throwing themselves at him right and left, which he obviously took advantage of as a reckless playboy."},{"instruction":"w do I install luxury vinyl flooring?","output":"It's likely that you bought your vinyl plank flooring as much for ease of installation as you did for its looks.

Are they likely to crash like Transformers at some point?","output":"There is one fundamental difference between Marvel and Transformers, or any other franchise like Bond, Fast and Furious, etc. The latter are all very narrow in scope ‚Äî the same set of characters, a limited universe, repetitive storylines. The Transformers have mostly the same set of characters, and even the newer ones that are introduced (like the Fallen) are forgettable. Also, since they are all giant mechatrons, it is hard to give them all distinctive personalities. The same is with Fast and Furious. Sure, they introduced a new villain in Statham‚Äô Shaw, and now Idris Alba, but there is not even differentiation or character development there. Marvel has the advantage of falling back on 80 years worth of comics source material for newer storylines. Despite the fact that Endgame had about five dozen characters [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #dkGUe] , the number pales in comparison to over 60,000[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #OxRUw] total named characters in Marvel‚Äôs kitty. There is also the distinctive upper hand of having a wide-range of characters ‚Äîtechnological geniuses, gods, monsters, anthropomorphic beings, cosmic entities, super-powered humans, sorcerers, supernatural being, androids, and so on. They have leveraged this fact wonderfully to create a universe whose movies can‚Äôt be classified in a single genre. Iron Man series was like 007 on steroidsCaptain America flicks were war and espionage themedGotG was a space operaAnt-man movies were heist action featuresThor was mythological, fantasy filmsSpider-man: Homecoming was a teenage comedy + drama + romance rolled into one The upcoming Black Widow movie will likely be a crime action thriller. Shang Chi will introduce Martial arts to the MCU. Blade will be supernatural action extravaganza. When they (eventually) reboot the X-Men series, they will get their hands on a property imbued with themes of social oppression. Fantastic Four could be a family space adventure. Moon Knight would lend itself beautifully to a psychological thriller with flavors of Split and Nightcrawler. Man Thing could potentially open up the creature horror sub-genre. So, no. Marvel is not over-saturating the market. They have released two movies a year starting 2013, then amped it up to 3 from 2017. There are only 5 flicks slated for release over the next 2 years which is their usual run rate. They have also done the smart thing of focusing on TV shows to address any impending movie fatigue. If anything, the market is over-saturated with articles stating that the superhero genre, and especially Marvel, has saturated.

I am not a doctor, but if I remember correctly, COPD is a way that the body copes with all of that. If you stopped, COPD might hang around, but it will disappear (especially if you really don‚Äôt want to kill your lungs earlier than they should be). You only have one pair of lungs that are yours.

When you are listening to radio or having a phone call, you are actually hearing light: All of the wireless communication is based on the electromagnetic wave or simply light.

The reciever detects these and the original sound is then extracted. 2. Computers are not very smart. Not at the fundamental level. To make a computer do simple arithmetic, lots of circuitry is required. This is compensated for by the size of these circuits as billions such can be crammed into the palm of a hand. So, a good sized machine acting smart is bullying hoards of little dumb circuits. 3. Ground or 0V doesn't really exist. Its a matter of convenience rather than actual existence. 4. A ‚Äòreal' laser doesn't produce a single wavelength of light. Technically, it only does so when it is kept on forever, which of course is never the case.

Thus for your advantage I have made a rundown out of these 15 factors with the goal that you can pick achievement instead of battle in your life and business. who succeed fast? 1.) The individuals who battle have a \\"Can't Do\\" disposition and the individuals who are fruitful have a \\"Can Do\\" frame of mind. 2.) The individuals who battle don't accept guidance, get outraged by analysis as opposed to utilizing it, and don't prefer to be instructed or even imagine that they don't have any of the data/assets that they need, or that they ought to learn and attempting to improve. The individuals who succeed are continually looking for information and exhortation, are open to instruction adn trainable, use analysis to make course redresses and flourish with it and learning, and look for guides and instructors and are continually improving regardless of how far they get. 3.) The individuals who battle are apathetic and reckless, the individuals who succeed are basic masterminds. 4.) The individuals who battle enable themselves to be harmed and become negative when terrible things transpire. The individuals who succeed remain positive despite the fact that awful things transpire as well. 5.) The individuals who succeed know what their identity is, the thing that they are about and esteem, what their lifes reason for existing is and what they need throughout everyday life, what their objectives, dreams and yearnings are, and in this way they have complete thoughts regarding what they are doing and what they will achieve and how (/why). The individuals who battle don't have authoritative thoughts regarding such things, yet have a non-descript thought of and wish for progress, which is unattainable due to the way that it is too conceptual and indistinct. 6.) The individuals who succeed deal with their egonomic assets (time, vitality, cash and different assets) well and work on contributing instead of spending. The individuals who battle don't deal with their assets cautiously and burn through cash, time and vitality recklessly instead of seeing everything as a speculation. 7.) The individuals who battle are searching for employer stability and just have a sense of security being a representative of somebody elses, however then regularly get themselves not progressing expertly quick enough, and even wind up out of a vocation now and again, in light of the fact that they are not the ones responsible for their own profession. The individuals who succeed are self starters with an entrepreneural attitude who are answerable for their own vocation and who contribute their cash and develop various floods of pay so they are constantly dealt with and accumulating increasingly more cash. 8.) The individuals who succeed keep up a solid healthy adjusted way of life and the individuals who battle don't deal with their wellbeing and live imbalanced lives. 9.) The individuals who succeed practice long range informal communication and develop loads of sound connections and develope an enormous interpersonal organization. The individuals who battle stick to shut groups of friends and have constrained public activities and restricting social practices. 10.) The individuals who battle will surrender when they get dismissed or come up short, the individuals who succeed persevere through dismissal and disappointment, improving their strategies and attempting over and over until something works. 11.)

The individuals who succeed are receptive, appreciate attempting various things and getting things done in new manners, and will test and investigate various choices to locate the best ones and are continually searching for defects and blames to address and approaches to change and improve what they do. 12.)

The individuals who succeed are pleased with their uprightness and keep up it in their strategic approaches. The individuals who battle are simply hoping to prevail for doing as such. 14.) Effective individuals assume liability for their lives and possess their mix-ups and issues and are accountable for their very own outcomes. The individuals who battle censure others for their issues and seek others for hand outs and openings. 15.) Fruitful individuals realize that they are not their practices and are continually developing and building up their characters and persona and bettering themselves and transforming their shortcomings and social dangers into qualities and openings. The individuals who battle feel that they are what their identity is and dont create themselves or their practices, way of life, character, picture, and so on. Notice any examples there?

Furthermore, appreciate the extraordinary achievement that you will have with these standards, and the improvement of your fantasy life! who succeed slowly ? Most importantly, I got various measure of direction and pleasure realizing that I am taking care of an excruciating issue that is tormenting numerous entrepreneurs. In spite of advances in information investigation innovation changing over information into significant bits of knowledge stays a significant agony point for many entrepreneurs around the globe ‚Äî and ordinary I am eager to get up and chip away at taking care of this issue for those individuals. Besides, the experience I've picked up building Humanlytics made be amazingly intrigued by the convergence of computer based intelligence and the examination world, particularly relating to its capacity to mechanize a significant part of the exhausting and troublesome work that people can't do (or can't do effectively) these days . I discover extraordinary bliss building something that I think will take care of this issue. At last, all through my voyage building Humanlytics, I have been acquainted with individuals from varying backgrounds who are incredibly enthusiastic and driven. Their help and friends en route makes the way to progress considerably more charming. Now, does making progress still issues to me? Without a doubt YES. However, it never again is my solitary objective. I am superbly fine taking the moderate way to progress and I will appreciate the view en route. On the off chance that I am at last effective, I need my prosperity to be advantageous to society, to take care of individuals' issues, and I need to carry individuals around me with me if conceivable. I've additionally started to understand that there are huge amounts of effective individuals that likewise took the \\"moderate\\" way also. As of late, I turned out to be amazingly fixated on Hamilton, the melodic by Lin-Manuel Miranda, so we should utilize him for instance. To many, LMM is a virtuoso. His first melodic ‚Äî In the Statures, guaranteed the Tony for the best melodic of the year, and Hamilton is one of the most noteworthy netting musicals in Broadway history. Notwithstanding, it's critical to comprehend that In the Statures was an undertaking he started in 1999 during his Sophomore year at Wesleyan College and the show didn't debut until 2007. The year it won a Tony (2008) was very nearly 10 years after the show's underlying origination. Something very similar applies for Hamilton. He had the thought for it in 2009 .He at that point went through a year writingits best tune \\"My Shot\\", and made progress 6 years after the fact in 2015. Something very similar can be said for Google, Walmart, and numerous other incredibly fruitful individuals and organizations on the planet today. Considering my encounters alongside the experience of individuals I realize that have turned out to be effective has driven me to a solitary end: achievement doesn't originate from diligent work ‚Äî it originates from reliable, energetic work over an extensive stretch of time. In the event that you hope to work 80 hours per weeks for a year and make a million dollars you will be frustrated. Rather, you should work for 60 or 40 hours every week on something that you can see yourself accomplishing for the following 5 years and do it with incredible consideration and energy. For me, the vision of utilizing innovation to assist individuals with bettering comprehend their information may take 5 years, 10 years, or even 20 years to achieve, however I am alright with that. I feel that it is both beneficial work and at some point that I can bring home the bacon off of. In view of this I am alright taking a shot at it for a long time before I see genuine achievement. Truth be told, I am additionally alright with the way that I may never progress toward becoming \\"fruitful\\" in the feeling of the present feeling of the word. Achievement is a discretionary judgment society places e work of an individual and I have no control of who lives, who kicks the bucket and who recounts to my story. To me, it presently has turned into a probabilistic game that you have an extremely high possibility arriving on an inappropriate side of it on the off chance that I make a decent attempt seeking after it.

Examples: dry sense of humour (Ritchie Blackmore) versus practical jokes (Ian Gillan). Worst combination ever that would often let infighting break loose;walking-on-eggshells feeling. That is what you get when your guitar player is Ritchie Blackmore, whose control over his bandmates and music was legendary;drug abuse (alas). Unfortunately, there was one lineup in which a couple of Deep Purple members used to be keen on substances. This, too, added up to their trouble history. Sad but true. In spite of their place among rock gods, Deep Purple have always seemed a step behind other greats like, say, Led Zeppelin, because of their utter lack of stability. You need to match a face (a lineup, in this case) to a string of successful songs, if you want your success to endure and stand tall against time. In the case of Deep Purple, although that string of hits does exist, you get to match it to different faces - think of Hush (Deep Purple‚Äôs Mark I), Smoke On The Water (Mark II), and Burn (Mark III), for instance. Three different frontmen. Three different lineups. That could be enough to get even most of hardcore rockers confused, couldn‚Äôt it?

A human big toe, a liberated phalange, a left big toe from the look of the curve. I picked it up carefully with a sheet of notebook paper as my guard. I wrapped it up, and presented it to my biology teacher in 4th period. I have no good explanation as to why it lasted first though third period in my locker wrapped up within notebook paper. Perhaps I needed time to process why this little piggy was so set on going to market that he abandoned all the other piggies in such a permanent fashion. But that is what happened. Upon presenting it to my Biology teacher in front of the class he examined it with an eyepiece and proceeded to put it in a small jar of Formaldehyde, with a wide eyed giant grin of approval, and displayed it for several days there in class. He soon turned it into the police to learn it was from a man mowing his lawn who had an accident with his lawn mower. I really didn‚Äôt perform well in that class but yet I got an A for interesting, I suppose. The preceding is very true, the proceeding in mere conjecture, and morbid curiosity.

It was mid summer a few years back. My girlfriends and I would get together weekly with all our young children, 8 in total, ranging in age from 1 to 6 years old. They would play in my fenced back yard while the moms would move between the kitchen, the deck (just off the kitchen), and the lawn, watching kids and cooking dinner.To explain the layout, my kitchen and deck are both approximately 7 x 12 ft in size. The entry from the garage to the kitchen is near the northwest corner of the room on the west wall, and the door from the kitchen to the deck is near the southeast corner of the room, on the east wall. The steps from the deck to the lawn are at the north side of the deck. The door from the deck to the house was propped open, so the multitudes of small children needing mom or the restroom could come and go freely (bug counts were low, and the door-pounding way too frequent).One of the kids claimed they saw a large rat running along the fence in the back yard. We don't have rats in my neighborhood, so all the moms were outside running around, looking in every corner for something that could hurt one of the children. We didn't find anything, and forgot all about it, and went back to sitting on the deck, talking and watching the kids. A while later, my friend went in the house to get a diaper for her son out of her diaper bag, which was sitting right next to the door to the garage. She came right back out and announced there was a live animal in her diaper bag. I told her that was impossible. It was most likely a stuffed animal with realistic fur. She insisted it was alive. I went in with her, and saw a rounded, salt and pepperish colored hump right at the top of the bag (this was a well-packed bag, so the opening was at least a solid 12 inches off the ground). I nudged the bag with my foot, and sure enough, it moved! We didn't know what it was, and didn't know what to do! I grabbed the bag by the handles, held it out from me like it was some kind of bomb, and ran across the kitchen and out the open door with it, as if it might explode any moment! I dropped the bag on the deck, and jumped back. Nothing happened. I edged forward and nudged it with my foot. It didn't move. I kicked it again and knocked it over, and sure enough a baby possum - probably 6 inches long - rolled out, and scampered and down the steps and under the deck. We grabbed all the kids and brought them in the house - we didn't know why a possum would be out during the day, and around people! What if it had rabies! What if the mother had rabies and was looking for it!We eventually figured out that the 'rat' the kids saw was probably the baby possum. While we were searching the yard for him, he must have come from under the deck, travelled all the way across the porch, into the house, and all the way across the kitchen before crawling into my friends diaper bag. We think the mother must have been killed, and the baby got desperate for food. I couold be wrong though. I really don't know that much about possums. I'm sincerely glad he stopped there though, and didn't go into one of the kids' bedrooms to hide. We might not have found it for days!"},{"instruction":"Do you agree with Pope Francis' decision to canonize Popes John Paul II and John XXIII as saints?","output":"With the canonization of John Paul II I certainly agree wholeheartedly. There was great acclaim even at his funeral, if you remember the crowd shouting ‚ÄúSanto subito!‚Äù i.e. Make him a Saint immediately. He was a pillar of strength in the Church and one of the greatest Popes we have ever had. He suffered much under both the Nazis and the communists, and was a major actor in the fall of communism and disintegration of the Iron Curtain. John XXIII had been eclipsed a bit since his death in 1963. There was not much cultus in his favour. He was declared a Beatus in 2000 after a nun with an incurable stomach cancer was miraculously healed after asking his intercession. Pope Francis dispensed with the second required miracle for canonization, and pushed John XXIII forward because he called the Second Vatican Council. Pardon me, but numerous Popes have summoned Ecumenical Councils and not been canonized. It‚Äôs hardly a sufficient reason. What is better proof of John XXIII‚Äôs sanctity is his successful efforts during World War II, to save tens of thousands of Jews. He was Apostolic Delegate to Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. He issued false baptism certificates and obtained visas allowing thousands upon thousands to evade the Nazis and the feath camps. Personally I think Pope Francis should have waited for due process, a second miracle, rather just push ahead with a canonization because he wanted to promote Vatican II. Paul VI (Montini) has also been beatified. And John Paul I (Albino Luciani). If we are not careful we will end up with automatic beatifications/canonizations of every Pope, and I don‚Äôt think that is a good idea. Too much of the ‚ÄúAll shall have prizes‚Äù mentality.

The truth is, there is no clear-cut answer to this question as there are pros and cons associated with this type of cooking. To understand if food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health it is important to understand how microwave ovens work and the science behind them. A microwave oven works by emitting a type of electromagnetic radiation, known as microwaves, which heat the food through a process called dielectric heating. Dielectric heating occurs when microwaves excite the water molecules in food, causing them to vibrate and produce heat. As a result, the temperature of the food increases and it is cooked. Given that microwave ovens use electromagnetic radiation, a common concern is that the radiation may be harmful to your health. However, this is not the case as the type of radiation used in microwave ovens is non-ionizing and is far too weak to cause any long-term damage to the body. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also stated that microwaves are safe to use and that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that microwave ovens pose any health risks. Despite the fact that microwaves are safe to use, there are still some potential health risks associated with microwave cooking. For example, some studies have suggested that microwaving food can reduce the nutritional content of certain foods. For example, studies have shown that certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B and vitamin C, can be lost when food is cooked in a microwave oven. In addition to this, microwaving food can also cause chemical changes in the food which can lead to the formation of compounds that have been linked to certain types of cancer. For example, when microwave-cooked meats contain nitrites, they can form compounds called nitrosamines which have been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer. Overall, it is difficult to definitively say whether food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health or not. While microwave ovens are safe to use, there are still some potential health risks associated with them which may make them a less than ideal choice when it comes to cooking meals. If you do decide to use a microwave oven, it is important to make sure that you follow all safety guidelines and that you are aware of the potential health risks associated with microwave cooking."},{"instruction":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","output":"Here are 3 tips to get relief from your back pain üëá 1‚Ä¢ Sleep Better When you have back pain, sleeping can be hard. It can be a vicious cycle because when you don't get enough sleep, your back pain may feel worse. A poor sleep position can also aggravate back pain. Try lying on your side. Place a pillow between your knees to keep your spine in a neutral position and relieve strain on your back. If you need to sleep on your back, slide a pillow under your knees. Be sure to sleep on a comfortably firm mattress. 2‚Ä¢ Good Posture Grandma was right! Slouching is bad for you. And poor posture can make back pain worse, especially if you sit for long periods. Don't slump over your keyboard. Sit upright, with your shoulders relaxed and your body supported against the back of your chair. Try putting a pillow or a rolled towel between your lower back and your seat.

Let‚Äôs see: The require a great deal of exercise and so they aren‚Äôt good dogs for most older people or sedentary ones - Younger people, who spend a great deal of time outdoors, are the best owners for Huskies, but most people don‚Äôt realize that.They are very territorial - It can be difficult to have other pets and have a Husky move in. At best, they are likely to bully other animals; at worst you might come home to a dead pet. A number of people don‚Äôt realize this, or somehow believe that they are immune to harsh realities.They can be aggressive - Few people want to deal with an animal which is still very aggressive after you have it neutered. Basically nips and bites aren‚Äôt appealing to people, and they can become costly if they occur to an elderly person or to a child.They tear sh*t up - Most of the Huskies that I have run across are destructive dogs, and that dims their appeal to new owners. Having a dog cause thousands of dollars in damage doesn‚Äôt make them appealing.They aren‚Äôt necessarily good with children - Anecdote: A friend had joint custody with her ex, and her child spent every other weekend with him. She bought a Husky and tried to integrate it into their family. Unfortunately her child being gone and coming back was something that the Husky could never grow accustomed to. It would growl at the child, and it soon worried my friend that the dog might bite her. She finally found a home for the dog and to be blunt, no one really missed it when it was gone. Huskies are working dogs that probably should only be owned by young adults without other pets or children. The dogs can be aggressive and territorial, and that‚Äôs often a great deal more work than most people want to put into owning an animal. Rather than researching the breed carefully and making sound and logical decisions beforehand, most people fall in love with the puppies, and then come realize that their beliefs and wishes don‚Äôt match the realities on the ground. People then abandon them because they (the people) make poor decisions and then someone or something has to pay for those decisions. Unfortunately that‚Äôs usually the animals.

Some people may choose healthful meals throughout the day, while others have a small breakfast and dinner. Some people may also find that eating smaller, more frequent meals makes them feel less hungry. Whatever way you select, it is critical that you continue to acquire the nutrition your body needs. If you're not hungry between meals, you might want to examine your diet to ensure you're receiving enough calories and nutrients. But, do you know how to trick your brain into eating less? Please watch the video below to get the answer: [LINKED_TEXT: How to Trick Your Brain into Eating Less?Tired of failed diets? Eating less might have more to do with our eyes than our stomach. Here's why.https://www.ganjing.com/video/1fcf5otqh413YGp2k02hMxMAr1hl1c] [URL: https://www.ganjing.com/video/1fcf5otqh413YGp2k02hMxMAr1hl1c]How does it work? When we eat, our intestines release cholecystokinin, which triggers the release of another hormone leptin. Leptin helps make us full. But this process takes time. So, we keep eating without realizing that we‚Äôre full. So, we also rely on our eyes to tell us when to stop. (Image: Mediamodifier/Pixabay) 2 sorts of fullness signals One comes from nerve cells in your stomach's wall, and the other from hormones secreted by your gut when food digests. The stomach signals detect how much the stomach wall is expanding, which indicates the amount of food consumed. These go quite quickly from the stomach to the brain.Your gut hormones have a distinct function. They register the nutrient content of what you've eaten, and they take longer (approximately 20 minutes or more) to transfer all the information from gut to brain. (Image: [LINKED_TEXT: Engin_Akyurt/Pixabay] [URL: https://pixabay.com/photos/breakfast-table-food-macro-2649620/]) How to Train Yourself to Eat Less 1. Train yourself to take smaller portions Controlling your portion sizes, on the other hand, isn't just lip service. There are some genuine benefits, both physically and financially, to reducing the quantity on your plate, Make use of a smaller plate. On a bigger dish, a standard-sized serving will appear little, leaving you unsatisfied. To avoid overloading, use a smaller plate,Drink a glass of water. Filling your stomach with water will naturally make you less likely to overeat.Vegetables and Fiber. Adding veggies to your meals is a simple way to minimize calories while feeling satisfied.Slow down your eating. Slowing down when eating boosts satisfaction and minimizes quantities. To make your food last longer, eat gently, set your fork down between pieces, and sip water. (Image: RitaE/Pixabay) 2. Train yourself to eat slowly Chewing your meal for a longer period of time breaks it down more, which aids digestion. Furthermore, by eating slowly, you give your brain a heads up to notify your stomach to begin digesting,Enjoy your food: It‚Äôs hard to enjoy your food if it goes by too quickly. If you eat them slowly, you can get the same amount of great taste, but with less going into your stomach.Improved digestion. Eating slower allows you to chew your food more thoroughly, which leads to improved digestion, (Image: [LINKED_TEXT: Croisy/Pixabay] [URL: https://pixabay.com/photos/mushrooms-tomatoes-parsley-1351561/]) 3. Train yourself to eat till 80% full The idea is to eat like the Okinawans and quit when you're 80% full. Or, in their words, eat until you're no longer hungry, rather than until you're stuffed. In practice, one method to do this is to eat more slowly.Eating until you're 80% full has been demonstrated to help Okinawans live longer, healthier lives. Slowing down when eating has various advantages, including feeling more filled and content with less food and lowering overall calorie intake. In conclusion As you can see, the simple design of physical hunger and satiety is often overshadowed by other bodily cues, habits, needs, and emotions. Therefore, the need to identify and deal with them appropriately is an important step in the process of recognizing true hunger. Learning to eat intuitively - meeting your body's true physical needs for fuel and nutrients - will help you reach your healthiest weight naturally for a one-of-a-kind body."},{"instruction":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","output":"Marmite."},{"instruction":"What is happening on Earth in the 'Dune' series?","output":"It's spoken of in the books the same way we speak of Atlantis or Kumari Kandam: it no longer exists.

Earth is frequently referred to as ‚ÄòOld Earth‚Äô or ‚ÄòOld Terra‚Äô or just ‚ÄòTerra‚Äô by the characters of the Dune universe, but it does not feature in any of the novels, and there are numerous explanations and theories why. Just remember that there are various different explanations. Frank Herbert‚Äôs original series, the prequel and sequels written by his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Andersen, and the non-canon (but adequately well-written and thought-out) Dune Encyclopedia. In the Original series- what was written by Frank Herbert himself- within Children of Dune, Leto II stated that historical figures like Chaucer were known to few, though Saint Thomas was referenced in the Orange Catholic Bible and Azhar Book. But he noted that the only place people of his day and age would know as London was a village on a planet called Gansireed. Very few if any would have heard of Canterbury, or earth itself. Leto II claimed that Earth was ‚Äòno longer existing‚Äô. Whether he meant it was lost or had been destroyed, or rendered inhabitable, either way, if there were any people left remaining on earth, they had long since lost contact with the rest of the galaxy‚Äôs civilisation. It was not a part of the Empire. In Chapterhouse: Dune, set several thousands of years after Paul Atreides, Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade also claimed that earth was ‚Äògone‚Äô. We don‚Äôt know what happened or how it came to be lost to humanity, but it was still inhabited during the time of the Butlerian Jihad or Machine Crusade, when humanity went to war against their Thinking Machines, or Artificial Intelligence overlords and eventually won their freedom (rendering all A.I taboo). What was presumably one of the last things that happened on earth, was the Commission of Ecumenical Translators, a large assembly of people, gathered on neutral islands (implied to be the Hawaiian islands), where they came together to create the Orange Catholic Bible and the Azhar Book for the Bene Gesserit. This meant that the Bene Gesserit were present on mankind‚Äôs last years on Earth itself, if they didn‚Äôt originate there. It was also likely that they composed their famous Litany Against Fear, on Earth. The Orange Catholic Bible was a fusion of all significant religious thought in the universe. By the time of Paul Atreides, religions had been merged together, like Buddhism and Islam (the Fremen were descendants of Zensunni practitioners, who merged Zen Buddhism with Sunni Islam). The ‚ÄòCatholic‚Äô here, may refer to the fact that the word ‚Äòcatholic‚Äô meant ‚Äòall‚Äô or ‚Äòuniversal‚Äô, but it could also likely mean the traditions of the existing Roman Catholic church. But the ‚ÄòOrange‚Äô here might also refer to the Orange Institution, a Protestant Christian movement which was often at odds with the Catholic church itself. Therefore, it meant that these various, previously conflicting Christian beliefs had now merging together. In the Expanded Universe books, written by Brian Herbert, Earth was still a fixture and the centre of human civilisation during the days of the ‚ÄòOld Empire‚Äô, whoever was in charge. During that period, however, humanity, having been too successful, grew stagnant, hedonistic, lazy and complacent. They fell into decline, only for a radical movement to grow. The followers of this movement called themselves Titans and later became ‚Äòcymeks‚Äô or cyborgs, to start a movement, yearning for the old days of conquest and glory, because their lives lacked meaning. Earth fell under their control, and the Titans had huge frescoes and grand monuments built in their image, like in the Golden Age Square, where countless slaves laboured in constructing a frieze depicting the victory of the Titans. Eventually, the Titans themselves were overtaken by their seemingly omniscient A.I system Omnius, and the rest of the Thinking Machines. It became the central world of the Synchronised Worlds, as it was known, under the control of Omnius. Omnius was actually a collection of powerful, artificially intelligent entities or systems, Omnius Prime, the most senior and powerful in control, was housed on Earth. The human population there were almost all enslaved and the Thinking Machines were unable to grasp or comprehend human emotion or the value of human life, so unless they proved somehow useful, they were meaningless except as Beasts of Burden. Countless innocents died during that period. One of them was an innocent baby boy, the son of a captured and enslaved noblewoman named Serena Butler and Xavier Harkonnen (who ironically was Vorian Atreides‚Äô friend, in contrast to later generations of their descendants). The robot Erasmus thought the infant was a distraction and a hindrence to the work effort, killed him and subsequently removed Serena‚Äôs uterus to prevent her from having another child. Led by Serena Butler, the humans subsequently rose up against the Thinking Machines and the Titans in a revolt, joined by Vorian Atreides, son of the Titan Agamemnon (meaning that House Atreides was not actually descended from the mythical Agamemnon, as they later claimed). In response, Omnius ordered the genocide of all human populations on every planet under his control, and proceeded to exterminate the human population on Earth first. But his orders never went beyond Earth itself as Vorian Atreides and Xavier Harkonnen led an army which intercepted the ship carrying the orders. They were then able to evacuate many of the surviving humans on earth. The Butlerian Jihad had begun, and the Army of the Jihad, as it was known, launched an Atomic Strike on Earth in an attempt to exterminate Omnius and all Thinking Machines, rendering Earth a barren, desolate place. It remained uninhabitable for centuries, until humanity returned and the Orange Catholic Bible was written and compiled there, millennia later. It was rebuilt environmentally, but became a minor planet with a population of just over 2.5 billion. Eventually, as in the original series, humanity saw the creation of Artificial Intelligence, even computers with automated responses and actions, as taboo. In the Original series, Expanded Universe and Dune Enclyclopedia, the Orange Catholic Bible‚Äôs first rule is often quoted: ‚ÄòThou Shalt Not make a Machine in the Likeness of a Man‚Äôs Mind.‚Äô In the non-canon Dune Encylopedia, Earth somehow never had any sort of democracy, or maybe all records of it were lost (deliberately wiped out, or mankind lost all concept of it, when they fell into stagnation and decline). The First Empire founded on Earth was recorded as being Alexander the Great‚Äôs empire (or Aleksandr, as they called him), roughly around 16500 B.G (circa 300 B.C.E) which saw humanity‚Äôs advancing from bronze-age tools and weapons, to iron ones. Even though we know that Alexander‚Äôs dynasty, the House of Argead, and his conquered empire fell not long after his death, records in the Dune Encyclopedia refer to a single ‚ÄòImperial Seat‚Äô as being the centre of humanity‚Äôs civilisation and its empire, the centre of government and all rule of humanity throughout the course of history. Records show that it moved to Byzantium in 15800 B.G, when there were provincial rebellions and minor jihads. But in 14700 B.G there was the period known as the Great Struggle, a century of conflict where there was no emperor, what was referred to as a Dark Age. But Madrid became the new Imperial Seat in 14608 B.G, when discoveries in America began (presumably referring to Christopher Columbus‚Äô voyage and the rule of Isabel I and Fernando II of Spain). But after ‚Äòthe Battle of the Englichannel‚Äô as it was called (perhaps they misspelled it because they didn‚Äôt know what England was, let alone its channel), 14512 B.G, London became the new Imperial Seat. They were referring to what we know as the invasion and defeat of the Spanish Armada during Tudor times. Then Washington became the new Imperial Seat in 14255 B.G after the first Atomics were unleashed in a ‚Äòprovincial war‚Äô (aka World War Two)! But then a ‚Äòplanetoid‚Äô or possibly asteroid decimated Earth, and the Imperial Seat moved to the asteroid Ceres, in 13402[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/13402_BG]B.G (2798 CE). The following year, the Rescue of the Treasures rescued significant historical relics, including priceless works of art, and dispersed them throughout the galaxy, while Ceres became the new Imperial Seat for centuries. Eventually, in 13360 B.G (2840 C.E), Earth was re-seeded with both plant and animal life, and set aside as a natural park. The Commission of Ecumenical Translators met on the Hawaiian islands to compile the Orange Catholic Bible, not long after the Butlerian Jihad. By 2800 A.G (c. 19,000 CE) Old Earth, as it was known by then, was now a Barony, an imperial fief ruled by House Corrino (the ruling imperial dynasty by the main events of the first Dune novel). The Terrans- the denizens of Earth- enjoyed exemption from being conscripted into military service or being drafted from interstellar colonisation efforts. At this late period, deserts including the Sahara Desert, were populated by the Zensunni ancestors of the Fremen. However, upon the discovery of the planet Potritin, Emperor Elrood V decided to break tradition and ordered colonists from Old Earth would populate this new planet. The Siridar Baron Charles Mikarrol (who governed Earth) feared a widespread revolt amongst the population, so he decided it was better to send the Zensunni than anyone else, even against their will. These people would eventually make their way to Arrakis. Was Earth destroyed? Slowly fell into decline, and its plant and animal life died out? Did its human population eventually leave completely to resettle elsewhere or died out? Whatever happened to earth, we can be certain of one thing, by the events of the main series, it was lost. Earth is referenced in Dune Messiah, when the Face Dancer Scytale wonders about a period in history known as the Golden Age of Earth, when mankind only inhabited their native earth, and their civilisation flourished before its stagnation, decline and eventual servitude to Thinking Machines or Artificial Intelligence. The ‚ÄòGolden Age of Earth‚Äô is referred to more in a mythical way, more than a historical one. The way we romanticise the past today as a time of knights in shining armour, beautiful princesses locked in towers waiting for someone to rescue them, or glamorous balls and floaty ballgowns, the period of human history, by the events of the series, has been romanticised and much-idealised. Some people might never have even heard of earth, as Scytale reflected. Others thought it was a myth. When Paul asks Stilgar how much history he studied, Stilgar proclaims that he knew about human migrations throughout the Imperium. Paul interrupts him and asks whether he knew about the Golden Age of Earth. Stilgar‚Äôs response was: ‚Äò‚ÄúEarth? Golden Age?‚Äù Stilgar was irritated and puzzled. Why would Paul wish to discuss myths from the dawn of time?‚Äô Of course, Paul- as the Kwisatz Haderach with access to ancestral memories- knows better. He‚Äôs seen and remembered Earth. He knows it‚Äôs no myth. But Stilgar doesn‚Äôt. To the majority of people in the Dune Universe, Earth has become to them what Atlantis is to people today in the real world. But those like Paul and his children Leto II and Ghanima, know better due to their access to their genetic memories. The Bene Gesserit knew it existed for certain, and even possessed a painting by Vincent Van Gogh (Thatched Cottages at Cordeville/Thatched Cottages and Houses).

For the sake of discussion, let's say you have a domestic violence/alcohol call, and you are told that the man is a former heavyweight boxer.","output":"How do police arrest large, aggressive men? For the sake of discussion, let's say you have a domestic violence/alcohol call, and you are told that the man is a former heavyweight boxer. This question reminds me of Thomas Waltz, the so-called \\"midget cop\\" who works, or at least once worked for the City of Davis, California. Many people I know have anecdotes of their encounters with (now?) Lieutenant Waltz. Specifically, one woman I know was pulled over by Waltz when he was a patrol officer, and she could not see him when he approached the driver side window of her car. It was all she could do to stop herself from laughing out loud. She literally thought it was some sort of prank when this disembodied voice asked for her license and registration. [LINKED_TEXT: Tom Waltz - Davis - LocalWiki] [URL: https://localwiki.org/davis/Tom_Waltz] On one apocryphal occasion, then Officer Waltz was off duty and out of uniform when he tried to intervene (without backup) with a group of rowdy frat boys who got out of hand at a local Davis bar. The frat boys took him outside and beat him up. As far as I know, the frat boys were never caught, and never punished. I often wonder why people are drawn to professions where violence is part of the job, but even more so when they are of such small stature. I am sure that Lt. Waltz packs a punch and knows how to shoot a gun, but there's just no way that he can possibly command any sort of \\"officer presence.\\" This mysterious and magical quality is what most police officers use to keep the peace when they are outmuscled."},{"instruction":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","output":"You can simply earn 1000 monthly through freelancing if you do it the right way. thus, the following ways are proven to help greatly if applied correctly: Step 1: Figure out what you're good at, and make sure you can deliver your very best. Step 2: Build a profile. The importance of having a full and presentable profile cannot be overstated. It's a one-stop shop for your personality, resume, portfolio, and expertise. It's also a useful method for persuasion. Step 3: Look for projects to bid on and begin bidding. This is where you start making money. Every day, hundreds of projects and competitions in various categories are uploaded. Check the Jobs or Contests page often to find the ones you want to work on. You'll find appropriate projects available for bidding on the jobs side. You literally enter competitions by submitting an entry. Step 4: Get to work. This is the most difficult but also the most satisfying move. Before you begin work, double-check that you and your boss are on the same page in terms of project scope, deadlines, and Milestone Payments to avoid any problems down the road. To close the contract, you will want to have a signed agreement in place. Step 5: Get paid and get 5-star reviews. You can withdraw your funds via PayPal Wire Transfer, Moneybookers, or your designated local bank account once you've been paid (works through our Express Withdrawal System). Also, always strive for five-star reviews; building up a portfolio of great, high-quality feedback is a great place to start."},{"instruction":"What are the similarities and differences between the different classical dance forms of India?","output":"I have been attending a beautiful dance program recently. This is whau I got to know about classical dance forms. May become very handy! Katthak- the main emphasis is based upon the exoressions of whole body and face. Suitable for botj men and women.Bharatnatyam- it is geometrical in nature. Here various shapes are being formed with different body moves.Kathakkali- a dance form with heavy garments and has heavy makeup! Performed mainly by male dancers! Theme is fight between good and evil ‚Äã‚ÄãOddissi- the main feature of this dance form is its Tribhangi.Mohiniattam- sister dance form of Bharatnatyam. Performed by women only.

Could that be why Thanos broke it so easily?","output":"Well, no. That absolutely could not be the reason. Thanos‚Äô blade is incredibly sharp. So sharp, that it can cut through vibranium. Listen, this may sound crazy, but its very possible and likely what had happened. Now let me put this into perspective, you have a block of wood and a sharp knife. You hit the wall with the block of wood, It does relatively nothing. You hit it with a knife, its gonna put a massive scratch against that wall. Sharpness is measured in two ways, but I‚Äôm gonna use one of them. Basically, it‚Äôs how easily you can cut through something without putting in much effort. Now imagine how much stronger Thanos is than a normal human. How much force Thanos would exert? But MAYBE he wasn‚Äôt hitting him that hard and he was using blunt force to break it. Yeah definitely not hitting him hard, geez Thanos, don't go that easy on him. To add to that, it‚Äôs definitely not blunt force either. Are you telling me a shield that could withstand Mjolnir couldn‚Äôt withstand a hit from Thanos? Blunt force is HORRIBLY ineffective against vibranium. The entire point of vibranium is to absorb kinetic energy Which it will very much do against blunt force attacks. However, not so much against sharp attacks. Just look at Black Panther and his claws for an example. So, you‚Äôre telling me the only two things that have done significant damage to the shield are sharp attacks? Normal, metal would also be too heavy for Steve to throw around as vibranium is more durable but only 1/3 of its weight. So to conclude, no. Absolutely no way It could've been made of normal metal. Knowing who directs these films though, they‚Äôd probably make this official canon. But no, It was not made from normal metal."},{"instruction":"Which is the best theme restaurant in Bangalore?","output":"1. Village ‚Äì Soul of India, Sarjapur RoadAmbience, ambience and ambience!

I procrastinated a bit and took longer to find private healthcare insurance than I should. But, heck, I was in great shape and the odds were with me. Within three months of retiring, my legs went numb. After examinations, doctors discovered a spinal tumor. It was not cancerous but was cutting off nerve impulses to my legs. After a couple of operations, and a stay in hospital, I was facing a rather large bill without insurance. And I was looking at future procedures to monitor my condition. That was not part of my plan. Right about this time, the U.S. stock market took a huge dive. My stock portfolio was reduced almost by half. That was not part of my plan. What a surprise that my blood pressure, which had been very good my entire life, shot through the roof to the point I was worried my head would explode. This required me to go on blood pressure medication for a few years. That was not part of my plan. My six-month, bed-ridden convalescence, caused me to lose muscle definition and gain weight. That was not part of my plan. I met my current wife. For many reasons, we decided to buy another house rather than build on my property. That was not part of my plan. Although I bought our current house when the real estate market was bottomed, that same bottom made it very difficult to sell my large undeveloped property. I am still stuck with a very nice property I am unwilling to sell for a bargain-basement price because the real estate market has not yet recovered. That was not part of my plan. Although the outcome is not a complete departure from my original plan, it only vaguely resembles what I had in mind before retirement. There were many twists, turns, unexpected hurdles, and joys that were not part of my plan. Lessons I would pass along (and if you are like me, you may feel you can completely ignore them as we are all unique individuals) are these: Have a larger monetary buffer than you think will be needed for retirement. Have contingency plans. What to do if the original plan goes tits up? Be adaptable. Adapt and overcome because plans are nice but, as a retired architect, I can say they seldom turn out as they were originally visualized."},{"instruction":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","output":"Raw tobbacco cigarettes.

Upscaling is the process of transforming low-quality media to a greater resolution. To upscale a video from 1080P to 4K, you need to add 6 million pixels and much more for upscaling old videos. Based on the surrounding pixels, AI video upscaling software like Topaz Video Enhance AI can figure out what each new pixel should be. Let's see how effectively AI can upscale video up to 8K. [LINKED_TEXT: [Tutorial]How to Upscale Video to 4K 8K by AI-Best Setting for Animation[Online and Desktop]How to Upscale Video to 4K 8K by AI with the Best Settings for Animation Videos in [year].https://mysolutions.tech/upscale-video/] [URL: https://mysolutions.tech/upscale-video/]Step 1: Add Video To upscale videos to 4k or 8k, you must first import them to the AI upscaler. Import using Browse or drag-and-drop. You can also load the last auto-saved project by selecting ‚ÄúLoad Last Auto Save.‚Äù Using Topaz Video Enhance AI, you may batch upscaling videos and customize the AI engine. 2. AI Model A proper AI model will outperform. Presets in Settings can be chosen or suggested by selecting video quality, type, and artifact kind. You can also compare the AI models to discover which one you like. Step 3. Set Size Topaz can upgrade videos to 8K. Set the upscaling resolution. If you select 100% denoise and deblocking, only those effects will be applied. Step 4: Grain Settings The AI upscaling program calculates the grain settings automatically based on your video. You can adjust the amount and size, but I recommend keeping the default. For me, the default setting is fine. Make sure you understand how it works. Step 5: Format Video Video output is currently available in MP4 H.264 and MOV ProRes 422 HD. So we'll see what happens. Using lossless PNG or uncompressed TIF (8 bit) or TIFF (16 bit) is recommended by Topaz. Other software is believed to produce superior results when combining upscaled photos frame by frame. For me, MP4 H.264 works well for AI video upscaling. Step 6: Trim and Preview AI video upscaling takes a long time. Don't want the whole video upscaled? Trim it with Topaz. To trim, click ‚ÄúMark start frame(I)‚Äù and ‚ÄúMark end frame(O)‚Äù. You can also preview the selected AI model or all suggested AI models before deciding which to use. Default previewing is 30 frames. Step 7: Start Upscaling Process AVI, MKV, MP4, WebM, and WMV films to 1080p, 4k, or even 8K.

He wrote: It doesn't. Wavefunction collapse is not a physical process. It is a mental model, arguably a flawed one, of the most problematic aspect of the quantum theory. My answer is based on Quantum Field Theory. In QFT there are no ‚Äúwave functions‚Äù, there are only fields and these fields exist in the form of independent holistic (Mani Bhaumik‚Äôs term) units called quanta. When a quantum collapses it is indeed ‚Äúa physical process - not a mental model. Here are three excerpts from my book ‚ÄúFields of Color‚Äù, which explains QFT to a lay audience without using math: Chapter 1: Quanta evolve according to the deterministic equations of QFT, but there is one event that is not described by these equations. When a quantum transfers energy to an absorbing atom it disappears from all of space; it cannot continue to exist without energy. Although we don‚Äôt have a theory for quantum collapse, we can predict its probability (see ‚ÄúThe Gaps‚Äù in Chapter 10). Chapter 9. In QFT the wave-particle duality paradox has a simple resolution. Each quantum is a holistic piece of field that acts as a unit. If it is absorbed by an atom, all its energy is deposited into that atom and the quantum disappears from all space. Even if only some of its energy is transferred, as in scattering (see cloud chamber photo in Fig. 6-6), the entire quantum collapses. While this process is not described by the field equations of QFT, it is a necessary consequence of the holistic nature of quanta (see quantum collapse in Chapter 10). Chapter 10: If fields evolved only as described by the field equations, nothing of significance would happen, because these equations don‚Äôt describe the transfer of energy or momentum. For example, they don‚Äôt describe how a photon transfers its energy to a photoreceptor in your eye. I call this process quantum collapse because when a quantum transfers its energy it disappears from all space; it can‚Äôt continue to exist without energy.[LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-wave-function-collapse-in-quantum-mechanics-physics] As Art Hobson wrote, referring to the two-slit experiment: The entire spread-out field‚Ä¶ must deposit its quantum of energy all at once, in a single instant, because the field cannot carry some fraction of one quantum‚Äîit must always contain either exactly one or exactly zero quanta of energy. When the field deposits its quantum of energy on the viewing screen, the entire spread-out field must instant¬≠aneously lose this much energy. ‚Äî A. Hobson Quantum collapse is similar to collapse of the wave function in QM, but the concepts are very different. The QM wave function describes the proba¬≠bility that a particle is in a given place or that the system is in a given state, and when a measurement is made the probabilities ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù into a certainty. In QFT the collapse is a physical process and it happens whether or not a measurement is being made.

If you are thinking that you will chant OM NAMAH SHIVAYA 1 billion times in an entire life and then you will relax by considering that you will get moksha then I don‚Äôt think that it will work 100 %. Chanting mantra alone won‚Äôt be beneficial. You will have to surrender yourself to Shiva(Parabrahmn) and you will have to become free from the hands of vikara like kaam(desires), krodha(anger), lobh(greed). moh(attachment), mad(arrogance) and matsarya(jealous). According to many higher intellectual and spiritual people the person recalls everything at the end of his life which he did whole life and that becomes path of leading for him and decides what he will get next. Mostly people who were in the hands of vikara will only recall all these things in their last breathe. So make sure to keep Shiva always in your mind no matter the situation is good or bad. Before sleeping and after waking up the first thing which should come to your min must be just Shiva. No one knows when our last breathe will take place so be prepared for this always. In your last breathe you must only have one desire and that should be to attain moksha."},{"instruction":"What are some unique facts about Telugu?","output":"It is an interesting question. Since we are talking about language itself rather than its history or culture of Telugu people, I will answer this question from that view point. The points I am mentioning below are not any grammatical rules. They have just evolved with the time. 1. If you remove the first syllable of any noun and replace it with ‚Äògi‚Äô and add a deergham to the last syllable, then you are emphasizing the noun. for ex: ‡∞™‡±Ü‡∞≥‡±ç‡∞≥‡±Ä ‡∞ó‡∞ø‡∞≥‡±ç‡∞≥‡±Ä,‡∞ö‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞µ‡±Ç ‡∞ó‡∞ø‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞µ‡±Ç,‡∞™‡±Å‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞§‡∞ï‡∞Ç ‡∞ó‡∞ø‡∞∏‡±ç‡∞§‡∞ï‡∞Ç ‚Äú‡∞™‡±Ü‡∞≥‡±ç‡∞≥‡±Ä ‡∞ó‡∞ø‡∞≥‡±ç‡∞≥‡±Ä ‡∞ö‡±á‡∞∏‡±Å‡∞ï‡±ã‡∞°‡∞Ç ‡∞â‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞æ ‡∞≤‡±á‡∞¶‡∞æ?‚Äù Here you are emphasizing the word ‚Äòpelli‚Äô 2. If you add ‚Äôam‚Äô at the end of some non Andhra places Telugu equivalent name of that place is created ex: ‡∞ï‡∞ü‡∞ï‡±ç becomes ‡∞ï‡∞ü‡∞ï‡∞Ç in Telugu ‡∞¨‡±Ü‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞π‡±ç‡∞Ç‡∞™‡±Ç‡∞∞‡±ç becomes ‡∞¨‡∞∞‡∞Ç‡∞™‡±Å‡∞∞‡∞Ç in Telugu ‡∞ï‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞£‡∞æ‡∞ü‡∞ï‡±ç becomes ‡∞ï‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞£‡∞æ‡∞ü‡∞ï‡∞Ç in telugu 3. If you remove the last letter of any statement and add ‚Äòaa‚Äô for non Telangana slang and ‚Äôa‚Äô for Telangana slang, the statement becomes a question ex: ‡∞Ü‡∞Æ‡±Ü ‡∞µ‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞ø is a statement ‡∞Ü‡∞Æ‡±Ü ‡∞µ‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞æ? is a question. 4.If you add a deergham to the last syllable of any statement it becomes an exclamation ex: ‡∞Ü‡∞Æ‡±Ü ‡∞µ‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞ø is a statement and ‡∞Ü‡∞Æ‡±Ü ‡∞µ‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±Ä! is an exclamation. 5. You can make any non Telugu word a Telugu word by adding ‚Äòu‚Äô at the end of the word. Ex: ‡∞¨‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞∑‡±ç English ‡∞¨‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞∑‡±ç‡∞∑‡±Å Telugu. 6. If you add ‚Äúkonnadu‚Äù or ‚Äúkonnadi‚Äù or ‚Äú konnaaru‚Äù at the end of any verb, it implies that he/she/they have done the thing for himself/herself/themselves but not for others. Ex: ‡∞™‡∞æ‡∞°‡∞æ‡∞°‡±Å Sang for others ‡∞™‡∞æ‡∞°‡±Å‡∞ï‡±ä‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞°‡±Å sang for himself 7. If you change the gender of any person, it indicates love and affection. Ex: A father may call his daughter ‚Äú‡∞á‡∞≤‡∞æ ‡∞∞‡∞æ‡∞∞‡∞æ ‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞æ!‚Äù though the word ‚Äúrara‚Äù is second person masculine. A mother may call her son ‚Äú‡∞á‡∞≤‡∞æ ‡∞∞‡∞æ‡∞Æ‡±ç‡∞Æ‡∞æ ‡∞ï‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞æ‚Äù though ‚Äòraamma‚Äô indicates second person feminine.

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","output":"I dont think you do understand why the electoral collage was created. It wasnt due to communication, it was so that the President was elected by the states. Hr is the President of the United States not the President of the people. Direct election would assure the President was elected by the 20 or so largeest cities and thats where all the campaigning would be and where all the promises and benefits would land. South Dakota might as well take a holiday on election day because the biggest district in Chicago would nullify their votes. Lets say New York and California had huge turn outs and the rest of the nation had miserable weather and very few voted. Those two states alone could mount a near insurmountable lead, but the President serves all the states. Much the same reason South Dakota gets two Senators and so does New York. Thr belief that the electoral collage was set up because it took so long to get the votes counted is a myth. States managed to elect senators statewide . The other myth is that had we used direct elections that Mrs Clinton would now be President. That is false and here is why. Even though she received more votes than any other candidate,she still failed to get a majority, because other candidates took enough votes to prevent her from getting 50% plus one vote. There is and likely will never be a provision in thr constitution for a candidate to win without surpassing the 50% mark and there certainly will never be run off elections for the Presidency. Can you imagine after a campaign having to do it again. Therefore as the founders designed the election would have gone to the house of representatives, and since republicans held the house Trump would likely have still been elected even though they could elect anyone but if they ignored both candidates there would be a revolt from both sides. The electoral collage isn't perfect but has served us fairly well for almost two and a half centuries."},{"instruction":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","output":"A plea!

When the child was born he looked a little like me but was hard to tell because he was only a baby. The gf at the time also had similar features as me. The whole time I was with her she was extremely disrespectful and resentful of me. I don‚Äôt think this was all hormones, I feel this was guilt coming out of the subconscious. It wasn‚Äôt until a few months later when my parents saw the baby. My father was the one who purchased the DNA test because he strongly felt the baby was not mine.

I lost a baby, trust in a girl and more so looked stupid in front of my peers and family. Wasted time I would never get back.

While there is no perfect system that assures consistent gains, there are a few key guidelines to follow that can increase your chances of success in sports betting. Consider the following important factors: 1.Research & Gain Knowledge: Researching the players, as well as their previous performances, current form, injury news, head-to-head records, and other pertinent facts. The more information you have, the better decisions you will be able to make. 2. Bankroll Management: It is critical to manage your bankroll correctly. Set a budget for your gambling habits and stick to it. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. It's normally advised to bet a modest amount of your whole bankroll on each individual bet, usually around 1-5%. 3. Value Betting: It entails searching for value in the odds. Successful sports bettors look for wagers when the odds offered by the bookmakers are greater than the actual possibility of the outcome occurring. This requires examining the chances and comparing them to your personal opinion of the possibility of an event occurring. 4. Maintain Discipline: Avoid impulsive and emotional betting with discipline and patience. Stick to your predetermined betting methods and ideas. It's critical to keep calm and avoid chasing losses with risky plays. Discipline and patience are required for long-term success in sports betting. 5. Stick to your Best Sports: Instead of betting on every sport or event, consider concentrating in one or a few sports in which you have extensive knowledge. This helps you to narrow your study and build knowledge in specific areas, providing you a competitive advantage over more generic gamblers. 6. Compare Odds: Different bookies may provide somewhat different odds on the same event. Consider comparing odds from several sources and selecting the best possible pricing. Even slight differences in odds might have a major impact on your overall profitability over time. 7. Review and Analyse: Keeping a complete record of your bets, including the type of wager, odds, stake, and outcome, is essential. Review your performance on a regular basis to find strengths and faults. Analyzing previous bets might assist you in learning from your mistakes and refining your methods. Note: Never forget that sports betting contains an element of chance, and there will always be ups and downs. It is critical to approach it with a long-term mindset and not anticipate rapid reward. Responsible gaming is critical, and it's best to get treatment or support if you suspect you're developing a gambling issue."},{"instruction":"WW2? Why did we appease the USSR so much?

Here are a few valuable things things that I learned when becoming a professional writer. I hope some of them will help you in your work. 1) Finish what your start. There is a famous quote that says, ‚ÄúIf you write, you‚Äôre a writer. If you wait, you‚Äôre a waiter.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be the writer who only ‚Äútalks‚Äù about their story and writing. Write it. Yes, it takes self-discipline to sit down and write, edit, and finish a work, but in the end, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done. 2) Be in a strong writers group. Writers do well in a community and not so well in a void. A trusted network of writes in various genres to bounce ideas off of is a treasure. Plus, a community keeps writers from being hermits. 3) Focus. When evaluating the lives of successful self-published writers (writers who were able to quit their day jobs and support themselves by writing) there was one thing in common: unrelenting focus. I have multiple skills and tried doing all of them while trying to be a writer at the same time. But this phrase says it best, ‚ÄúJack of all Trades, Master of None.‚Äù Focusing on just the writing doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm not a musician or artist anymore. Those skills and loves are still with me and will be with me when I‚Äôm ready to use them again. 4) Perfectionism is a stumbling block. For fantasy, I work as a co-author with my husband, and truthfully, our first book suffers from ‚Äúfirst-bookitis.‚Äù That means it has some raw spots and could be better. However, many, many well-known writers have raw first books. You will, too. We have matured immensely as writers since then, but after the last rewrite of book 1, we decided to leave it and move on. Always do your utmost creative and professional diligence, but at some point, finish it, learn from it, and move on to the next and then the next."},{"instruction":"Why do you think that Target has been so successful in the United States but not in Canada?","output":"I‚Äôve heard a lot of people a lot of people talk about how it‚Äôs challenging moving to a new country, especially to Canada due to different cultures and infrastructures. Nonsense. Canada isn‚Äôt that different from the US and it‚Äôs obvious what they want the most is competitive prices, which is what everyone in the world wants. But Target somehow failed to provide that. It had similar products to its competitors but significantly higher prices. How does an experienced retailer bungle something like that? There can only be two possible explanations: Target management were idiots, idiots so stupid they thought they could set their prices as high as they felt with complete disregard to the competition and Canadians would somehow be obligated to pay it.Target management were idiots, idiots so stupid it never occurred to them to give look and the infrastructure they were buying to see if it would allow them to set competitive prices. Number 2 seems a better description of the thoughts of a failed CEO, but then why did he even authorize entry to Canada if he couldn‚Äôt bring a low price? The other issues like their useless supply system definitely hurt them and made it worse, they still took a back seat to this intellectual triumph. If you were a movie executive, and you realized you hadn‚Äôt sent a well-known, successful action movie had been screened around the world, but not in Canada, how hard can it be to make it a success there, too? If you realized that for some reason you couldn‚Äôt play the movie on Canadian projectors, would just set up a TV at the front each cinema or would you wait until you could provide the same cinema experience as in the states? If you picked the second option, congratulations, you too can be a CEO with a multi-million dollar golden parachute! The most infuriating thing is that Canadian wanted Target to come.

The latest example is the success of Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome missile-defense system in reducing casualties and damage from rocket attacks. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces says that Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Iran-backed terrorist groups based in Gaza, had fired some 1,700 rockets against Israeli cities this week as of Thursday evening. But the defining image of the conflict so far isn‚Äôt Israeli infantry maneuvering into enemy territory. Instead it‚Äôs the night sky over Tel Aviv that lights up as batteries of Iron Dome missiles, using radar and sophisticated computer systems, track and shoot down 90% of the incoming weapons. Israel and the U.S. have worked on missile-defense systems for decades, but most efforts have focused on shooting down long-range missiles. The Iron Dome is tailored to defend a small territory with threats concentrated along Israel‚Äôs borders. An Israeli firm, Rafael, developed the technology in the 2000s, and in the 2010s the U.S. pitched in for deployment and to acquire some of the systems. In 2020 the American firm Raytheon announced a partnership with Rafael to build Iron Dome in the U.S. Iron Dome saves Israeli lives and property, but it also changes the propaganda calculus for Israel‚Äôs adversaries.The high rate of missile interceptions gives Israel‚Äôs leaders more flexibility in how they respond to the attacks. Fewer Israeli casualties means there‚Äôs less political pressure for a full-scale invasion of Gaza or for indiscriminate air attacks that could kill civilians. Palestinian casualties are a propaganda coup for terrorists, and Israeli restraint saves lives and extends the window for its defense forces to act before they come under opportunistic condemnation from abroad. If the rocket attacks continue, Israel will have to make difficult decisions about how to stop them. Israel also needs to send a message to Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon on its northern border, which has tens of thousands of missiles. Meanwhile, Israel‚Äôs missile defenses are saving lives and perhaps reducing the chances of wider escalation."},{"instruction":"Why is Armenia so conservative?","output":"ƒ∞t is like greece they have only history and not future."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"The simple answer is that the fire from the thousands of gallon of jet fuel burning weakened the steel they were maid of and it bent on the floor where the fire was the hottest.

The main reason is that if you push things or join in the anti-PRC bandwagon of other countries, no one will take Taiwan seriously. You‚Äôll be seen as a proxy and will be treated like so. As demonstrated multiple times, no one is gonna save your ass going against a nuclear armed space faring missile waving behemoth like China who is about 100 miles (160 km) away. If you rock the boat and join in with the others to spite the Mainland at the fullest, the PRC will speed up the process of trying to reunite Taiwan instead of taking their time. If you drag out the status quo, you might, emphasize MIGHT, be able to wear out the PRC‚Äôs ambitions. If time passes long enough, they may actually leave Taiwan be, and Taiwan can continue being itself albeit with some reservations and concessions. The most important thing to the PRC is that Taiwan won‚Äôt be used as a platform against China, be it local Taiwanese or Foreign Powers. Be seen and treated as a neutral party, and it will be a live and let live scenario. Though you have to remember, this process will have to take generations to achieve. It be hard to swallow with such a big threat against Taiwan, but they‚Äôll have to take the heat if they want to survive as is without being fully annexed. No one is going to save them, and they simply cannot win a huge physical modern fight with so much striking power from the PRC, who don‚Äôt even need to invade the island to achieve their aims. They might not even need military means to reunite, as there are those within Taiwan who can do work to do so, be it reunification supporters or opportunists who have no political loyalty and will do anything for compensation. So Taiwan has to play smart. With that said, the second thing regarding increasing and maintaining the people‚Äôs confidence in the political system, is that the only thing keeping the ROC alive is its political system. Due to that reason, no matter what flaws it has, Taiwan is not a failed state. It‚Äôs only when you reach a fail state situation is where other countries will truly take advantage of you. When people lose trust and respect to the political system, and people start doing things outside the legal boundaries with impunity, then Taiwan is pretty much fucked. The PRC will tear Taiwan apart when that happens, and the foreign countries will test the waters but won‚Äôt be all there to help you if they see that. They don‚Äôt want that type of liability. At the moment, it hasn‚Äôt gotten to that stage because of how political minded and socially active the Taiwanese are, including those who claim they‚Äôre not political. However, things can change anytime, and they just gotta be careful and work hard at keeping it together."},{"instruction":"Who represents the GOP in 2021?","output":"Hopefully the majority of patriotic, legal,God loving, intelligent, taxpaying citizens.

Been there, done that. My common law wife became pregnant even though we were using birth control. She made it quite clear she had no intention of carrying a child for 9 months or risking her life giving birth. I was of a different opinion. This is called a disagreement, it happens to couples all the time. I highly recommend the following treatment. Talk to each other. Don‚Äôt talk to friends, parents or siblings. Skip the clergy and Facebook until you have had a lot of very long conversations with your partner. Long story short, never had any children. Do I regret that? A little yes, I think I would have been a good parent. My wife passed away so I‚Äôm alone now, But I will never begrudge her decision. She was the only person entitled to decide what happens to her body. This is me recognizing her rights over mine because I‚Äôm not physically involved. I may regret never having children but I do not regret not forcing someone I loved to go through an unwanted pregnancy and birth. If the discussion were over an embryo in a test tube that would grow to maturity there and then just pop out it would be different. I learned a long time ago that in order for a civilization to function and flourish, nobody gets everything they want. Everybody gives up something in order to live together.

If you have questions about the content, look it up online. If you can't find the answer, write it down so you know what to ask (given the opportunity) or at least when to pay more attention during the lectures. If you go into a lecture unprepared, you will miss so much, and regret it come exam time. For the best time of your life: It is much easier to choose friends in school than at work. The more people you meet, the more likely you will find friends for life, maybe even a future spouse. So, don't be afraid to leave your social circle (anyone you knew from high school) especially if they don't want to do the same things as you‚Ä¶ meet as many people as you can. Try new things. You are almost an adult and you can make choices you never made before. If you are invited to an event, try to say yes. The experiences you have (good and bad) will shape you - those memories will stay with you for a very long time. If you choose to have positive experiences, you will remember many of them as the best time in your life. I say ‚Äúchoose‚Äù because I knew some people who chose to hate the institution, and go home right after class every day rather than participate, they probably missed out on many good memories. If you are at the St. George campus, try the ‚Äúhammer‚Äù wings at Einstein's. Best wings ever. For your health: Sleep! It is easy to stay up late studying or partying, but reserve some evenings to give your body a rest. Don't sleep too much. Many people get overwhelmed and feel depressed. If this happens, force yourself out of bed and talk to someone. Work out! You might not find time to use the athletic centre, but everyone has time to do 10 push-ups and 10 sit-ups every day. Don't go to sleep until you do at least this! If you find you want more in your routine, add 10 donkey kicks. Soon enough you might be doing 100 of each every night."},{"instruction":"As a player, are there any game functions you have noticed that you wish more developers would include in games?","output":"The Nemesis System : Whenever I answer questions about my most hated Videogame enemies I tend to go with the more traditional enemies that many other gamers have loathed along with me the Sephiroths, the Liquid Snakes , the Bowsers and Dr. Robotniks of old . But you know who I really hated ? A character you couldn‚Äôt have possibly ever met because he only existed in my game. Prak the Elder‚Ä¶ the first Uruk to kill me in Shadow of Mordor , he was a pinkish uruk with long light white hair and yellow eyes . It‚Äôs been years since I beat that game and even longer since I beheaded that jerk but I can still hear him screaming ‚Äú YOUNG MAN !‚Äù in my head like he did whenever he saw me across the room . I hated Prak for lots of reasons , I hated that he was the first no name NPC to to kill me as I hastily tried escape from a battle early on in the game . I hated how Prak had a knack for spotting me whenever I was infiltrating an area doing a mission that had nothing to do with him. I hated how he grew stronger as I was murdered by his ‚Ä¶.uhh.. coworkers and fellow uruks . I hated how he came back after I back stabbed him to death ‚Ä¶ and then became impervious to stealth death blows ‚Ä¶ I hated how he forced me to run away from fights with him 3 times and later gloated about his victories. I REALLY hated him when I burned him in an explosion and he chose to come back with rags hastily covering his now melted face . As a fan of good stories and solid lore my 7 hour personal war with Prak the Elder as I played through Shadow of Mordor stands out as one of my favorite gaming periods ever. The beauty of the nemesis system was that it throws away the notion of faceless generic NPC‚Äôs , how ? Because if an NPC kills you you validate his existence in the world in a very real way . He gets a name ,perks, souped up armor, he has memories of your last fight , he carries scars from previous battles , and now he has traits . I butchered thousands of orcs in Shadow of Mordor and was happy to do it but years later , many games later , numerous gaming hours later I remember that one stupid archer who got a lucky shot on me and the intense rivalry and disdain I held for him as he grew stronger and I grew stronger and as I watched as my main character finally sent his head flying from his body to never be heard from again . I wish more games made me care and develop personal relationships with NPC‚Äôs the way Shadow of Mordor did . I think the hierarchies and the rivalries, and just generally being apart of a living and breathing world where you aren‚Äôt the only one changing and growing as your game progresses was amazing . I would love it if more games implemented the Nemesis system or something like it into their games. It gives the opportunity for players to create and engage in personal narrative creation. My Greatest enemy and our longstanding struggle spanning numerous deaths , defeats, and retreats of our own was a personal chess match I engaged in with Prak creating a very personal history of conflict. I think it‚Äôs a brilliant system and I‚Äôd relish seeing more of it in other games."},{"instruction":"As an IITian, what is the best piece of advice you would give to a JEE aspirant?","output":"the best advice I can give you is to remember JEE is not everything, I have seen many students suicide just because they don‚Äôt clear JEE so please remember JEE is not everything and secondly Do not expect a lot from yourself because expecting much and then not getting things will stress you up.

It‚Äôs Tuesday. I woke up at seven thirty with my alarm going off. I turned it off knowing it‚Äôs spring break. I went back to sleep and got up at eight thirty. I put my clothes on and went downstairs to eat breakfast. I poured myself a bowl of cereal and ate it when my mom came in.‚ÄúI have tons of shopping and driving to do today so I want you to drop off your stool sample at King‚Äôs Daughters,‚Äù she said. I sighed since I had a dentist and doctor appointment in one day yesterday which was exhausting.‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say yesterday you were going to do it for me?‚Äù I asked.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I said yesterday, but I don‚Äôt have time, so drive over there for me,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said with another sigh.Even though I didn‚Äôt want to leave the house again, I could only complain and head out sometime during the evening.‚ÄúOh yeah, bring down your bed sheet so I can give you a new one since it‚Äôs ripped,‚Äù she said. I shrugged my shoulders as I went upstairs. I grabbed my charger, phone, iPad, glasses, and roll of toilet paper before going into our guest bedroom. I set all that down on the desk that has the huge computer set. However, I was about to get on it and go to Quora to answer a question regarding genies when I spotted something weird out of the corner of my eye.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I asked, staring at the dresser nearby full of books and items. I felt an unusual attraction, to a particular bottle sitting on the dresser. I walked over confused and observed it. It looked to be an old wine bottle. I slowly reached over and was about to touch it when my mom yelled for me downstairs. I quickly left the room because my mother and father can be scary. Along the way I grabbed my bed-sheets.‚ÄúYes mom?‚Äù I asked.‚ÄúYour dad took your car today, so you‚Äôll have to drop it off tomorrow,‚Äù she said as she laughed at a prank video on her iPad.‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd he take it? I‚Äôll just take his truck then,‚Äù I said with a shrug as I put my bed-sheets in the laundry room before throwing away the ripped bed-sheet. I went back upstairs and revisited the guest bedroom. I decided to start up a novel website because I love reading. However, I suddenly remembered that bottle. I got up and walked over to it confused once again at it‚Äôs attractiveness. I carefully touched it and felt a smooth flow of electricity flow through my body. It didn‚Äôt feel unpleasant nor shock me. I felt the strange urge to rub it. When I did, blue smoke appeared everywhere and formed into a genie.‚ÄúWhat the hell?!‚Äù I yelled as I fell on my butt startled.‚ÄúHa-ha~! You have rubbed the bottle that contains me, the great a glorious genie!‚Äù said the blue genie that had strange Egyptian clothes on that reminded me of a very similar movie with this setting. You could see the pride on his face. I‚Äôm just staring at him, in shock. It‚Äôs taking a very long time for me to process this. Who would‚Äôve thought that there was a genie in my place? I was also about to answer a question on Quora regarding genies and wishes. What luck! Excitement began to coarse though my veins as I got up carefully with suspicion in my eyes. Even if it‚Äôs a true genie, there‚Äôs no way it would be simple.‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm a merciful and wise genie, I will grant you a wish mere mortal. You should be thankful and begging for such an opportunity!‚Äù it said with disdain, pride, and arrogance on it‚Äôs face. To be honest, I hate arrogant people. I was about to retort when my phone ringed in my jacket. Are you serious?! I looked at it and it was my dad! What does he want this time?! I clicked the green icon and put it up to my ear.Dad: You‚Äôre going to your doctors appointment today?Me: Yes, I am.Dad: Okay, if you‚Äôre gonna take my truck, then along the way, I want you to stop at the car-wash near speedway and wash my truck, especially the trunk.*a faint sigh*Me: Sure. Fine.Dad: it‚Äôs about six or seven dollars.Me: Yes-yes. I‚Äôll do that, I‚Äôll see you later then. I hand up the phone and sigh once again depressed.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with that look?! You dare ignore me?!‚Äù yelled the genie with anger in his face. I look over at him with a sneer and disdain on my face.‚ÄúWho the hell do you think you are?! My day‚Äôs gotten shittier because of my dad, and you want to yell at me?!‚Äù I yelled as my face turned red from anger. Truly pissed of now!‚ÄúI can end your life mere mortal with the flick of my finger! Bow beneath me!‚Äù it yelled. I can feel a strange force pull my body down but I resisted.‚ÄúI can give a shit less! If you‚Äôre a genie, then your only role is to grant wishes. Now, tell the catch!‚Äù I said as my anger slowly calmed down.‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù roared the genie. I‚Äôm surprised nobody has heard me yet.‚ÄúThe catch. What‚Äôs the catch? Nothing is granted without a price,‚Äù I said with an evil grin beneath the surface. I‚Äôm not stupid.‚ÄúAhem. Right, the catch,‚Äù said the genie who calmed somewhat down, ‚ÄúThere is no catch.‚Äù‚ÄúBull crap. Positives and negatives are closely intertwined. Reactions are always equal and opposite. Equal exchange. There‚Äôs no way in hell that a wish can be exchanged without there being a catch,‚Äù I said. The genie scratched it‚Äôs bald, blue head in confusion.‚ÄúWell, I guess the only catch is that you have to be careful in what you ask,‚Äù is said.‚ÄúAlright then, I wish for three more wishes,‚Äù I said.*flicks his finger* ‚ÄúDone, wait! You‚Äôre not supposed to do that!‚Äù yelled the genie in anger, but it was too late.‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say anything about not asking for more wishes. Plus, isn‚Äôt a genie supposed to be granting three?‚Äù I asked with an evil grin.‚ÄúShit! You got me, the great genie.

Now I have four.‚ÄúThis is bullshit!‚Äù yelled the genie whose face was distorted.‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs see.

Responsibility, as the owner of the weapon and most likely the person firing the weapon, you will be liable for where your projectile(s) finally stop their forward motion. What I‚Äôm saying is that when the weapon is fired and the bullet hits and penetrates a body, a wall, a window, a door or even through the roof, where that bullet or projectile lands and any damage it does becomes a liability for you. I‚Äôve been witness to several home invasions where the homeowner used a handgun to defend his home and family. Several times multiple shots were fired and missed the target but the bullet(s) continued on out of the house to a neighbors house. In one instance the bullet killed a refrigerator but twice they ended up in a living space, a bedroom dresser and a living room chair. There are several documented cases where bullets were fired in the air during a celebration or accidentally, the bullets came down and caused damage. You‚Äôre going to say, a shotgun round won‚Äôt penetrate a wall or a door, maybe, but it will penetrate glass. How many windows are in the average house and how do you get the home invader to stand in a safe place so the shotgun pellets don‚Äôt leave your property. Think about all the deaths from drive by shootings where the bullets penetrated the house and killed or injured a person in the house. I don‚Äôt like using names so it becomes difficult to provide specific details and information related to examples I would like to use. One example is a police tactical situation where a SWAT team was at a residence, the suspect had already stabbed two women in the house and was holding a third at gun point. The sniper was given permission to take out the suspect. He fired a round from a.308 rifle. The bullet killed the suspect but penetrated the body, two walls and the exterior of the house. It finally stopped two blocks away in a kitchen wall. Yes there was a lawsuit and the Police Department was held accountable for damages. Just something to think about. Even when you‚Äôre 100% in the right, you can be wrong."},{"instruction":"What travel destination turned out to be a huge disappointment?","output":"All my travels have been wonderful so far, but if I had to pick the least favourite one, it was Niagara Falls from US side.

I just played through the remake of the original Dead Space. I had never played it. It's been a while since I've played a compact, high quality game like that. They've become rare. Games like the Mass Effect trilogy or the Dark Souls trilogy. And it's not even about gameplay time. Most small, compact, high quality games... I end up playing through multiple times. But massive open world games, I'm so sick of them by the time I get through with them that I never replay them. For example, take movies. Most are 90 min. to 3 hours long. But when they film it, it's usually longer than that, but then it goes to the cutting room and all the lowest quality content is cut out, leaving just the best and essential parts of the story. Quality is more important than quantity. For some reason, that logic has been lost on game developers. They just make games bigger and bigger because they can, and the overall quality takes a nosedive as a result. Now I understand that some people like huge open world games that they can endlessly wander around in. And that's fine. But I wish some developers would rediscover the beauty of smaller, more compact, high quality games."},{"instruction":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient that they‚Äôre vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they‚Äôre in a care facility‚Äîassuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","output":"If you think the family member would appreciate it Any positive thing that helps someone feel less pain and confusion is okay by me.

The Standard Model has been on the market since 1949 and in its most recent update - the Mark IV, is still going strong. A similar system is used in the Austrian Roth-Steyr. The folding ‚Äútoggle lock‚Äù of the Luger is another alternative to the ‚Äúpistol slide‚Äù. Works just fine. There are drawbacks of course . The toggle lock is expensive to manufacture. It requires precise machining to function properly. If just a little bit of dirt, sand, mud, get into the toggle lock, the gun will malfunction. It must be kept clean. Those are the two alternative systems that come to mind, but there may be others. I hope this helps."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?","output":"We are well aware with the popularity of the leading frontend technology Angular.

We live in SoMa and have pretty easy access to: Chariot and other van pools the Caltrain to go to the Peninsula (e.g., Palo Alto), UberPool, LyftLine, UberX, Lyft, etc. public transportation trolleys, street cars, buses (muni, SamTrans), subways (BART), GetAround rental car (in our case, in our building) Free city bikes. Or ride your own. Some folks skateboard, esp. using a Boosted Board. Others like me like to walk a lot. Sometimes I walk 45 minutes to a meeting. Then I can skip the gym. Lastly Amazon Prime Now, Google Express, Postmates, Eat 24, etc. all deliver on-demand, often for free. And we have vending machines with pretty good food and drink in our building. My wife sold her car when we moved up here. I keep a car in L.A. when I go back. We find it more convenient to not have a car than to have one. We don't have to deal with parking, fight traffic, navigate, etc. I lived in Manhattan and it was similar except there the subways and cabs were even more convenient than they are in SF."},{"instruction":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","output":"Few days before, i was returning home from market with an e-rickshaw .Maybe you know them as they are quite famous here in India especially these days.

People were staring at her that how can a girl drive e-rickshaw but i was feeling super happy.I talked to her and was calling her didi (sister)during the whole ride . I love how she is breaking the stereotype that only men can drive rickshaws .

Living thing can grow, can move by itself, can breathe, can do reproduction, have consciousness and further human beings have self-consciousness, can digest, that is metabolism, so finally hunger is the base of all living beings. For metabolism food is required. For getting food human beings have to work. For doing work human beings have to get permanent Jobs. If there is no Job, there is no Life. No Jobs. No Life. Wellbeing of the World. Equality, Humane and Humanity. Inequality is a very, very Horrible Corruption in the world and in India. No Equality. No Skilled Education. No Permanent Job. No Quality Healthcare. In the name of God, in the name of Religion, in the name of Caste, in the name of Sanatana Dharma, in the name of Region, in the name of Rich, in the name of Poor, in the name of Language, in the name of Color, in the name of Race, in the name of Capitalism, in the name of Corporatism, in the name of Communism no one can divide or prevent the Equality, the Humane and the Humanity. Hence, henceforth, only a person or a political party who concerns about Equality, Skilled Education, Permanent Job, Quality Healthcare for all the people of the world and especially for the people of India, will become the Prime Minister or President globally especially in India. Ramalinga Adigalar's Equality and Global Well-Being. Caste and religious differences will eventually disappear. Universal brotherhood will come. It will be established in India.

I was struggling with something. The meditation guide simply said, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you throw away the struggle and what‚Äôs blocking you with the meditation method?‚Äù. I remember scrunching my eyebrows and going, ‚ÄúYea‚Ä¶that is a solution. Never thought of that before...‚Äù The solution was so incredibly easy. I tried it. It worked. I‚Äôm grateful. Scene 2: I was trying to help promote meditation at a booth outdoors on a weekend. Day 1 was fantastic, everything went well. Day 2 was incredibly hot, and I felt irritated. I stopped helping and went back to the meditation center. The meditation guide asked, ‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù. I said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too hot. I‚Äôm irritated‚Äù. All the meditation guide said was, ‚ÄúThrow away the irritation‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt accept the advice. I got irritated at him as well and decided to ignore him. The frustration lingered throughout the day and thoroughly spoiled the day too. When I finally let down my pride and threw away the frustration, I felt better. Scene 3: I had a medical appointment with the doctor from a year ago. I called the insurance provider about my medical bill and did not like what I heard. I told insurance they were being ridiculous. To top it off, the results from the medical appointment led to more medical appointments. I got home feeling frustrated. As soon as I stepped into the house ‚Äì dad saw my face. He said, ‚ÄúThrow away!‚Äù. I looked at him, and I had to break into a smile. He was right. I was carrying unnecessary frustrations just because things did not go my way. That night, I penned down the frustrations in my journal and threw the frustrations away as well during meditation class. I felt so much lighter after throwing away. I‚Äôm grateful. Scene 4: I was getting a CT scan. I felt a sharp pain in my hands as the contrast agent (dye) enters my body. I shouted. Medical staff quickly assessed me and said, ‚ÄúYour hand is ok, there is no swelling. You‚Äôre feeling pressure from the contrast going in. Please bear with it for a while. We are closely monitoring you.‚Äù I gritted my teeth. A few minutes later, medical staff injected saline into my vein. I shouted even louder. Aah! After the procedure was done (30 minutes max), I checked my hand. It felt tender. The vein looked slightly bigger but there were no bruises. It looked generally ok. But the pain ‚Äì stayed very strongly in my mind. That evening, I went to the meditation center to meditate. I threw away the pain from my mind. After an hour, the pain reduced so much from my mind. I felt relieved and grateful. Finally, the mind was in sync with the actual condition of the body, which was actually ok. There are many more scenes like the above. The advice - throw away - quite simply is a life saver. By throwing away my pain and negativity from today, I carry less of these burdens through to the next day. It leaves tomorrow free and fresh from today‚Äôs burden. This itself, is already life-changing for me. üíõ Thanks so much for reading! I‚Äôm also dropping a link to the meditation for those who are interested.

Here are a few examples: Physical sensations: As a purely digital entity, I don't have a physical body, so I cannot directly experience sensory inputs like touch, taste, smell, or pain.Emotional experiences: While I can comprehend the concept of emotions and have been trained on vast amounts of text data that discuss emotions, I don't have subjective feelings or personal experiences. Therefore, I may not fully grasp the depth and complexity of certain emotional states.Consciousness: The nature of consciousness is still a topic of philosophical debate, and it remains a mystery in many ways. Although I can discuss and provide information about consciousness, I don't possess personal consciousness or subjective awareness.Human intuition: Human intuition often involves subconscious processing and pattern recognition that is not easily explained or replicated. While I can analyze patterns and make predictions based on data, I don't have the innate human intuition that can come from years of experience and social interaction.Unfathomable complexity: There are aspects of the universe, such as the origins of the universe itself or the intricacies of quantum mechanics, that are incredibly complex and still not fully understood by humans. These topics may be challenging for me to grasp fully, just as they are for many experts in those fields.

The Founding Fathers lived through a government becoming tyrannical, and so they overthrew it. They were able to overthrow the Crown in large part because Americans had lots of guns - a right that was, by the way, first recognized in England. Because of the way our country was born, the Founding Fathers understood that government was inherently prone to tyranny, and needed significant checks to prevent it becoming tyrannical. And so in our Constitution, they wrote in checks - a bicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, an executive separate from the legislature, etc. They also added a Bill of Rights, based loosely on the English one, to permanently block the state from interfering in certain areas - including the right to keep and bear arms. The Founders were deeply concerned with liberty. And because of this, they gave us four proverbial ‚Äúboxes‚Äù on which liberty rests: The Soap Box - Free speech. You have the right to believe whatever you want, and to voice your opinion. Government cannot punish you because they disagree with what you say, no matter what. The Ballot Box - Elections. We have no King who rules by divine right. Our government officials are elected, and can be voted out if need be. Ballots are secret, and as such no reprisal can be made against a citizen for any vote he casts. The Jury Box - Trial by jury. The state cannot arbitrarily imprison anyone. We cannot have a Friesler or a Vyshinskiy on the bench who passes sentence at a whim. To imprison anyone, the state has to convince a jury of his peers - random people with no interest one way or another - that he deserves to be imprisoned for an actual crime that he committed. And finally, the Cartridge Box - The right to keep and bear arms. If the other three fail, a citizen can assert his liberty through force of arms. This is the last resort, and the one that enforces the others. If we lose this, our other freedoms are nothing more than words on paper that can be repealed at any time. With this right, our others are guarded by the force of one hundred million armed citizens."},{"instruction":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

It was a Thursday night, and I suppose some context is needed to explain why watching this movie was literally (yes, literally) a painful ordeal. I had spent almost all of the night before finishing up an essay, and what little sleep I received was interrupted when I had to get up at four a.m. to partake in my school‚Äôs early morning ocean swim program ([LINKED_TEXT: we were preparing for a particularly important swim] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-was-your-most-badass-moment-in-high-school/answer/Quinn-Hesters]). I suppose some people wouldn‚Äôt say that staying up like this is that bad, but I wasn‚Äôt really used to that sort of thing. The exhaustion and the headache didn‚Äôt really catch up with me until I was in line for Man of Steel with a friend. As we entered the theater around midnight, my friend convinced me to sit near the front, ridiculously close to the screen. Normally, I would have protested with him and fought to sit a little further back, but I just submissively obeyed because I wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly. Before the movie began, a guy working at the theater announced that they‚Äôd be using a new, louder-than-ever sound system for this ‚ÄúIMAX Experience‚Äù. He rather ominously warned that this was their first time using it and there would be no way to turn it down. I was so out of it mentally that I didn‚Äôt fully comprehend what this meant‚Ä¶ there have been some trailers, after which the attack on my sensory faculties started. It wasn‚Äôt as bad in the beginning, but once the action scenes became more frequent, I realized that I‚Äôd made a huge mistake. There were nausea-inducing swirls of motion dancing across the massive screen. Waves of sound bombarded my skull with merciless force. I was sure that my sleep-deprived mind was gently pouring out of my ears like it had been smashed to a pulp. My deep-fried condition of consciousness tip-toed in the side of darkness, and I needed to get fully up and then leave the movie theater for a few minutes. After splashing some water on my face and waiting for my headache to die down a little, I dared myself to go back in and watch the rest of the film. The picture above pretty much explains how I believed viewing the remainder of Man of Steel. I was rather worn-down and mentally broken from staying awake and trying to follow what was happening on-screen (the sound system made sleep impossible). I was so delusional that I could have sworn there was a part where Superman pretty much destroyed a city and snapped a guy‚Äôs neck‚Ä¶"},{"instruction":"w can I lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without exercising?","output":"Losing weight quickly requires a balanced approach of healthy eating and regular exercise.

The New Delhi Railway Station has the world's largest Route Relay Interlocking System, an achievement that has won the station a place in the Guinness Book of Records. 4. You probably already are aware of the fact that railway stations are super crowded and its because the Indian Railways takes 2.5 crore passengers daily to their desired destinations. 5. The Fairy Queen between New Delhi and Alwar in Rajasthan is operated on the oldest functioning steam engine in the whole world. 6. Ib Railway station of Odisha has the shortest name of all stations on the Indian Railways system. 7. You can only understand how vast the Indian railways network is when you get to know that if the tracks of Indian railways were to be laid out, they would circle the earth almost 1.5 times. 8. Indian Railways run 11,000 trains a day to make sure everyone reaches their destination in a timely and efficient manner, making it a hugely successful operation. 9. The Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corporation website is rather busy for it gets close to 12 lakh hits each minute. 10. The toilets found in Indian trains have always been a rather talked about feature but did you know that our trains got toilets only after Indian Railways completed about 50 years! 11. Indian Railways have always been the backbone of our country‚Äôs public transport system with 16 zones which cover a route of 65,808 km with 7,112 stations. 12. The Darjeeling toy train is still running on a steam engine that was made all the way back in 1881. 13.

There are no conservatives at all, none, zero who are in favor of that. The bailouts that occurred in the 2008 time frame, and in others were government actions that were undertaken because in the Judgment of the Federal Reserve and several other key government agencies, allowing all of those Banks to collapse would have threatened the stability of the financial system and would have produced massive societal chaos. As for borrowers getting student loan relief, because 90+% of those loans are government backed loans, forgiving those loans amounts to an expenditure by the federal government, which has to originate in and be approved by the house of representatives, per the constitution. It cannot occur just because the president wishes it to be so or thinks it would be a good idea. It is flat out illegal. Plus, if that loan forgiveness were to occur, you would see a great many people who never went to college bailing out students who borrowed to go to college, presumably to obtain higher paying jobs, and now cannot service their loans. That seems grossly unfair, and it is unfair to the people who have actually paid off their student loans. This loan forgiveness is nothing but a vote buying scheme to use taxpayer money to buy votes. It's disgusting."},{"instruction":"What is your say to All India Muslim Personal Law Board's plan to open Sharia courts in all districts?","output":"Do our laws permit dissolving of a marriage between two Hindus (or between two Sikhs or two Jains, for that matter) by a Khap Panchayat? The answer is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Then, why should there be such retrograde private bodies or private courts to decide the personal (civil) matters between two Muslims? In my humble opinion, the proposal of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) to introduce Shariat courts in all districts of India is a retrograde step, designed to introduce the centuries-old practices in India. What is needed is a uniform civil code (UCC) in India based on the modern concepts of equality, justice and gender-neutrality, as mandated in Article 44 of the Constitution of India as a directive principle of state policy. India is a secular country. We must encourage secular practices in civil law (personal matters) in India instead of encouraging practices on the basis of religion. Practices that do not respect the equal rights of women, such as polygamy and unilateral divorce, etc., need to be shunned in a secular India. It is in the interest of the Muslims themselves that they should oppose such proposal. The need of the hour is to move forward and adopt the best practices, and not to look backwards. I am writing all this, in spite of being fully aware of the provisions of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, which I feel should give way to a secular and modern uniform civil law. Uniform Civil Code, for example, would not mean that Muslims will have to take Saat Pheres or that Hindus will have to perform Nikah; it means that the general principles of a valid marriage / divorce, etc., will be laid down in the law, while the actual customs of performing the marriage may still vary as per the religious practices. I believe that it was a folly on the part of the first Government led by Pandit Nehru to codify personal laws of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, etc., on modern lines, but not touch the Muslim personal laws. When India accepted a secular Constitution in 1950, and our Muslim brothers and sisters also decided to happily continue to live in a secular India, there was no place for the above 1937 Act in India, which should have been repealed in the 1950s only. The way forward is a common and uniform civil law based on just, fair and reasonable concepts. Uniform civil law does not mean adopting a law that is presently applicable to Hindus or any other particular religion in India. It means accepting the best secular practices that should be acceptable in a modern secular society, based on the principles of equality, justice, gender-neutrality, etc. Moreover, the justice even in personal matters should be delivered by secular courts set up under laws of the land, and not by private courts set up by some organisation such as AIMPLB or by any religious courts or by any Khap Panchayats. Therefore, I am completely against the introduction of Shariat courts in India. Let me clarify in unequivocal manner that I respect all religions and I am not against any religion. What I am against is only the unjust and unfair practices prevalent in various religions."},{"instruction":"What puzzles you most about humans?","output":"Absolutely nothing anymore.

How does that work?","output":"So you‚Äôre wondering how ‚Äúoverwatering‚Äù can be such a big deal when plants are out in the rain all the time? Good - and very interesting - question. First of all, plants don‚Äôt always ‚Äúdo great‚Äù after alot of rain. The whole idea of ‚Äúoverwatering‚Äù is intimately connected to the type of plant, and the soil moisture plant are adapted to. If there‚Äôs way more rain than normal for an area, there are going to be plants there that will die, and others that will be weakened. If times of increased rain continue for many seasons, you might see the whole eco-system begin to change (By way of example, some years ago in Florida, we had a wet winter - it rained almost every day. This was totally unusual - winters in Florida are usually pretty dry, with rain generally every two to three weeks, and a whole month without rain isn‚Äôt unusual. The result was that the cactus garden I had planted was totally destroyed, the citrus trees in our yard were weakened and died within a year, and during the summer the number of large oaks and other trees around the city blown over by winds was noticeably higher than normal.) The reason is this - roots need air just as much as they need water. When the soil in which the roots live is too wet for too long, longer than the roots can handle, the roots begin to ‚Äúdrown‚Äù - the root cells are damaged, and the roots become prey to anaerobic bacteria and malevolent fungi - in other words, they rot. Now of course there are plants that live where the soil is soaking wet all the time - so what‚Äôs up with that? Easy answer - adaptation. Some plants have roots that are able to function in very wet soil - they have different ways of moving water and minerals into the plant, and different ways of combating infectious organisms, than do plants that live where the soil is drier. But, if their natural habitat dries for too long, they‚Äôre at serious risk. A side point here to your general question - it‚Äôs hard to get meaningful answers when you ask about ‚Äúplants.‚Äù The word ‚Äúplants,‚Äù refers to the gigantic kingdom of living things that are generally sessile and use light to make food through the process of photosynthesis. Beyond those, there are few generalities to be made about ‚Äúplants.‚Äù Some plants live in bogs; some plants live in deserts. Some plants sink their roots scores of feet into the earth; some plants dangle their roots in the air while hanging from trees. Some plants rise only a few centimeters above the ground, and live less than a year; some plants soar hundreds of feet into the air and live for centuries. So it always helps to question in terms of specific species, or specific growing conditions. Succulents are a specific type of plant that are adapted to living in dry regions, or regions that experience significant periods of drought. They look forward to rainfalls, times when the ground is saturated, so they can store up water for the dry times ahead. But it‚Äôs always possible to have too much of a good thing - if the rain goes on for too long, succulents start to suffer. There‚Äôs also another whole area of horticulture called ‚Äòindoor potted plants.‚Äô It‚Äôs often said that overwatering is the number one killer of indoor plants, and I think that‚Äôs pretty much true. The reason is two-fold. First, as I mentioned at the beginning, if roots stay too wet for too long, the plant usually dies. The second thing has to do with the conditions inside a pot, and how the movement of water differs from that of the outdoor world. That movement of water is usually called drainage. A pot is a tiny, tiny little place. In the open, the rain water spreads out, runs through the soil and away into the layers of soil beneath the plant roots, while the rain as it continues to fall saturates all the soil. In a pot, water movement is somewhat different. It runs through the soil toward the bottom of the pot, pulled there by gravity; then some of it works its way back toward the top of the pot by capillary action while some exits through the drainage hole; but some actually stays in the bottom of the pot, above the drainage hole (or ‚Äúdrainage layer.‚Äù) The water that rests in the soil above the drainage spot is called the perched water. The idea of perched water is kind of counter-intuitive, but it‚Äôs a very real thing. [LINKED_TEXT: Perched Water Table In Container] [URL: https://www.houzz.com/discussions/3806644/perched-water-table-in-container]. It explains why the idea of a ‚Äúdrainage layer‚Äù is an old plant care myth. It also explains why understanding the soil moisture all the way through the pot, not just on the surface, is so important to successful houseplant care. Drainage is why potting soil is not just some dirt dug up from the garden, but is a mixture of fertile soil, and other materials added to improve drainage -- in other words, to make sure the water moves through the soil easily, rather than sticking around too long. Things like sand, charcoal, compost, bits of bark, coir, peat, vermiculite, or perlite are the ones most often used. Another type of potting mix is something called ‚Äúsoilless mix,‚Äù composed primarily of peat or coir, bark fines, and perlite - since there‚Äôs no actual soil in this, fertilizer is added regularly. Most plant people recommend against using a potting mix with added ‚Äúmoisture managing‚Äù or ‚Äúmoisture retention‚Äù product - these just seem to keep the soil too wet. Besides using a good potting soil, it‚Äôs important to be aware of soil moisture, not just on the soil surface but all the way through the soil mass, and to allow the soil to lose the amount of moisture (aeration is the term for this) that‚Äôs required by the particular species of plant, before more water is added. So, for the succulents you mentioned in particular, the soil in the pot will need to be dry before more water is added. To find out what the soil moisture level actually is, we test soil moisture, with either an electronic moisture meter or some kind of probe. Drainage - the flow of water through the soil and its effect on the plants growing there - is one of the most basic and most important things to understand about growing plants. Hope this helps."},{"instruction":"medication always needed for ADHD no matter how good or bad your ADHD is?","output":"That's a really good question.

Oh, and my wife is always right. :-) Whether or not you need medication for your ADHD is a highly personal decision, and one size definitely does not fit all. Some (~20%) people don't respond to the standard stimulant meds, and others have other disorders (co-morbid) that don't respond well to stimulants meant to mitigate ADHD symptoms. Some people might have mild symptoms or have adjusted their lifestyle around so that the impact of ADHD is minimal in their lives or even beneficial. I think about entertainers and athletes, who gain from some of the ‚Äúsilver linings‚Äù or control symptoms with constant exercise. Anyone with ADHD or parents with ADHD kids have to evaluate: Is it impacting my life? At home? In relationships? At school? Work? How much? In order to evaluate that, it's important to first identify and understand the symptoms, so you can see them in your life. It's not obvious if its always just been that way. Another key factor to consider is how are your symptoms affecting the other people in your life, something us ADHDers aren't always the best at doing.

Extend that for the full 30 years and you have with ZERO payments a debt of: 29.024 trillion in nominal debt, 11.957 trillion in real debt (assuming 3% CPI) and 10.052 trillion in real debt pro rated per capita. Do nothing and the debt pays itself off 50%. Welcome to the magic of a AAA rated balance sheet with low low interest rates. The best thing you can do is float 100 or 250 year bonds - after 100 years of making no payments at all on the 20 trillion you end up reducing your debt from 20 trillion to 3.6 trillion in real terms or 2.02 trillion pro rated per capita. So grab a beer and relax mate.The unfunded liabilities: First you‚Äôve double counted these. As the current year‚Äôs unfunded liabilities are funded and form part of the budget deficit. Next point is that these are liabilities that crystallise over time. So if you funded them then you‚Äôd not only have a balanced budget for this year, but you‚Äôve balanced the budget in respect of these liabilities for all time. Given the interest rate environment best thing for it is to kick these down the road too. A good 250 years would be very nice. But OK I get it. You are arguing that the US Government should take care of liabilities as they accrue. That‚Äôs sensible, prudent governance. I get it. But that requires you to be a fund manager in order for you to manage your technical reserves that provide the cover for the future obligations. You do understand how much bitching that will create right? 100 trillion dollars of funds under Government management. Talk about flopping the elephant dick on the table. The total exchange capitalisation of the NYSE is only 30 trillion and the NASDAQ 19 trillion. And remember how badly Republicans bitched when TARP was supposed to take equity in banks for providing equity level risk? So what if now the US Government can buy control of every US listed company in the world and still have 50 trillion left over to fuck with entire industries globally. We‚Äôre not socialists or communists even if we think the government should actually own the means of production. Right? This would be 15x the size of BlackRock - the world‚Äôs largest fund manager and over 50x the size of Norway‚Äôs GPFG the world‚Äôs biggest SWF. And of course there would never be any graft of politicisation or the fund. But hey pump it why not. Are you really sure this is the way you want to go?Social not corporate welfare: Currently one reason why the budget is in deficit is because the budget is designed to benefit corporate donors. The policies of Warren, Sanders and Cortez for instance were costed and came with funding mechanisms.

I think both of them just thought Anakin quickly wanted power for its own sake and didn‚Äôt have the patience to obtain it slower through the light side. Yoda and Obi-Wan likely took it for granted that Jedis knew that the dark side doesn‚Äôt do or is capable of such compassionate acts as altruistic healing or resurrection, but Anakin apparently did not know this and was emotionally desperate enough to believe Sidious‚Äô bullshit about the dark side being capable of such things. Everyone focuses on Sidious‚Äô force lightning abilities and strategic planning skills, but for the above reason I think Sidious‚Äô greatest power was his ability to read and plant thoughts, suggestions, and visions into others‚Äô minds. Sidious is the source of Anakin‚Äôs dreams about Padme dying (maybe even also the visions of his mom dying), which set in motion Anakin‚Äôs dark path and really make Vader a victim. Similarly, (and I hate to say this because I hate the sequel trilogy and resent those movies being canon), Sidious was the source of Ben Solo‚Äôs dreams about communicating with Vader and his corrupted thoughts, which caused Ben to reject Luke and his parents and turn dark."},{"instruction":"it possible to use an extensive vocabulary without being a jerk?","output":"I agree with Vic Young: If you have a substantial vocabulary and use words others don't understand, they might label you a jerk, but that doesn't mean you're being one.

(Maybe I'm a jerk for writing in books, but only in my own books, and I do it in pencil and with the utmost respect.) I communicate with all the words I know. I'm not always sure which of those words others might or might not know. Isn't it more jerkish to dumb down your speech? Who am I to assume how limited or unlimited a person's vocabulary is? I once used the word bifurcate when rearranging furniture with a friend. I said, \\"You can use the couch to bifurcate the living room.\\" He started laughing, then made fun of me in a good-natured way: \\"BIFURCATE?! Well, hello, Maidel \\"Big Word\\" Barrett!\\" That nickname stuck with me for years. Yeah, I could have used the word divide, but bifurcate is more specific. I didn't know bifurcate was over the line.

Granted, Daenerys had no reason to listen to Tyrion when she found out that Cersei betrayed her even though Tyrion uncharisteristically trusted her. However, she decided to keep Tyrion as Hand. Killing his brother would have divided her advisors. Daenerys let the matter go, and that was wise. She would have gotten too much fallout for satisfying her wish to punish Jaime for killing Aerys.

This not only generates content but also shows that you value your customers and their experiences.Trending topics: Keep an eye on trending topics and hashtags on social media and find ways to tie them into your brand or industry. This can help you stay relevant and engage with your audience.Behind-the-scenes content: Share photos or videos that give your followers a behind-the-scenes look at your business or brand. This can include photos of your team working on a project or a video tour of your office.Infographics: Create visually appealing graphics that convey information or data in a clear and concise way. Infographics can be a great way to share industry insights or statistics.Curated content: Share content from other sources that are relevant to your audience and industry. This can include articles, blog posts, or videos that you think your followers will find interesting or valuable.Live streaming: Use live streaming to connect with your audience in real time.

Vaping is a way to get the nicotine without all the other harmful things that are in tobacco. Tobacco is an extremely unhealthy and dangerous way to stimulate dopamine. I believe that the chemicals in tobacco damage the body‚Äôs ability to stimulate dopamine. It is more intelligent to vape than to smoke tobacco. I started using a vape because I still had a positive outlook on life and I believed that I had a good future to look forward to. Therefore, I wanted to stop being addicted to tobacco and eventually stop being addicted to nicotine. It actually was not too difficult to get to a point where I would not use the vape for an hour or so, then 3 hours, then 6, then a whole day‚Ä¶ all I did was start using vape juice that had lower nicotine % and eventually, I would realize that I was beginning to ‚Äúforget‚Äù the vape, which means that I was no longer addicted to nicotine."},{"instruction":"What is the practical value of the bottom number in a time signature? I get the top number intuitively but the bottom number remains a mystery to me as a decent guitarist of 25 years only now trying to learn theory.","output":"The figure at the bottom only has value when the music is written down. If all you are doing is playing by ear, or by rote, it has no benefit. When the music is written down, it helps you interpret (in terms of beats) what is written down. There is much to be said for the way ABRSM teach it. They talk about duple, triple and quadruple time, based on the number of beats per bar (which you get purely from the top figure) and simple and compound, which describes how the beat subdivides, into 2 or 3. So 2/2, 2/4, 2/8 are all simple duple metres. 4/2, 4/4, 4/8 are all simple quadruple metres. Listening to a piece, it is impossible to say which simple quadruple metre it is."},{"instruction":"w long does it take to travel from one end of France to the other by car?","output":"YOU GOOGLE A MAP"},{"instruction":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","output":"You may want to do your research. It was the British and the British crown that did the heinous acts. Our Founding Fathers also knew that tyranny wasn‚Äôt just relegated to Britain. They put fail safes to protect Americans in the case something like this happened again. Unfortunately, things like this have indeed happened again and again by other governments. It‚Äôs still as relevant as it was in the 1700‚Äôs as it is today. Furthermore, you may want to take a look at the history of native Americans, slavery and the like by the US government. Any civilized government shouldn‚Äôt feel threatened by armed civilians willing to protect their rights from any who may seek to deny Americans their rights. We also have the right to bear arms to protect us from others, not just our government, to protect us, our rights and our security from those that would seek to deny us our natural and God given rights."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990‚Äôs which ended any major threat from Communism, caused a dramatic shift to the right of US Politics. Progressive politics in the US was historically centrist. It was a movement to reform Capitalism and alleviate it‚Äôs worst harms in order to prevent a Socialist revolution. When the threat of Communism went away, formerly moderate Social reform policies became the far left. In the 1960‚Äôs, New York and California already had free public Universities and most other States had very affordable subsidized tuition. Medicare was passed to cover the most expensive part of the population and it was understood that it would be extended to everyone else. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs MediCare not ElderCare. This was all a done deal, very much moderate status quo policy, not the agenda of the left. The Environmental Movement was just getting started in the late 60‚Äôs, but otherwise AOC wouldn‚Äôt have been considered very far to the left then. The far left in the 60‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt have called for increasing the marginal tax rates on the rich back to what they had already been a few years before, they‚Äôd have called for confiscating their wealth."},{"instruction":"What shall I do if I wiped out all data from my internal storage and do not have a backup while flashing a custom ROM through TWRP?","output":"Not sure I fully understand your question but you have to do that to install the custom ROM if you do a dirty install it, it will be buggy or just not install properly.

The answer depends on what all the non care giving person requires of the caregiver, and how they expect the children to be raised. Without going into details of my life, she needs time to herself, she needs the kids to be in activities so she can do chores (which does not always result in time to self or enough time to get things done). She needs to have vacations without you. She needs to have vacations where you don't attempt turn the woman's retreat into a family trip. She needs time to be away from all yawl without phone calls. If you tell her she can stay in a hotel for 3 days, don't nag her to come back at day 1.15. I wish I would have had this as the mom assistant, but let alone being the mom.

What do they do to grow their company every day?","output":"A couple weeks ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Oisin Hanrahan, the founder and CEO at Handy in New York, a platform that connects individuals to household service professionals. In the Q&A session he talked about the 5 tasks a startup CEO must take care of. 1. Set a vision The word vision is used quite often without properly explaining its context. I understand vision as the high level, long term plan where you want to go with your company. This is the highest level of guidance that you set for your startup. Once this is done, you start breaking things down to goals, strategies, tactics and activities. A nice vision could be: ‚ÄúBe Switzerland‚Äôs largest (in terms of users) job platform.‚Äù More on this topic [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://blog.intercom.com/why-startups-need-a-strong-vision/]. 2. Recruit people This is probably the most important task that you will be responsible for as a CEO. A wrong hire cannot only harm your culture but also end up in a very expensive nightmare and waste of money (we have been there and it‚Äôs not fun). Just some quick thoughts on this topic: Hire effectively ‚Äì meaning hire for quality and not quantity ‚Äì don‚Äôt hire out of need but because you feel the person is a great fit and adds value. Look for people who are willing to grow and ask them specifically about this during the interview. Check for cultural fit from day one and make sure that you are consciously building the culture. Finally, establish a fast and simple recruiting process ‚Äì when you know you want to hire someone, just do it! 3. Fundraise Bootstrap, if possible, until you reach product market fit. Fundraising is very important yes, but also very time consuming and a huge distraction for you to build a business. Additionally, the longer you wait for getting funded, the stronger your negotiating power becomes (assuming you are positively developing your business). Also challenge yourself and ask: Do I really need other people‚Äôs money to build my business? The ideal pattern looks like this: You start working on your idea and build first traction. After iterating based on customer feedback you hit strong numbers to proof your product market fit and are heading towards a cash flow positive business. Now you can either run the business profitable on your own, or, if this is a bigger opportunity, get investors on board to make your business big and scale things up. This is over simplified and will be elaborated in more details in different posts but shows how things look like in an ideal world. 4. Motivate people You are now a role model. Of course, you also have better and worse days and moments where everything just doesn‚Äôt work out as planned. However, you are now fully responsible for your team and act as a role model. Even when you have a bad time, you must stay positive and make sure that your team is surrounded by a positive vibe. There are a lot of startups that fail due to people problems. Don‚Äôt be one of them. The most powerful and probably also sustainable motivator for any employee ‚Äì but especially for startup employees ‚Äì is the sense of meaning derived from work. Create learning opportunities for your team, make sure they can take over responsibilities and make decisions and build a great culture that bonds your team. Sounds simple but is way more complex in real life. 5. Spread the word about your company You are also responsible for getting the word out there about your company. No one really cares whether you exist or not if they have never heard about your company ever. Of course, this means attending conferences, holding speeches and workshops but also building a (personal) brand around your topic. Just make sure that you first spend enough time to actually develop a business that you can talk about instead of spending time on spreading the word too early without building the business first. The latter would be a huge waste of time."},{"instruction":"it hypocritical for libertarians to be prolife?","output":"Libertarians are INDIVIDUALS and individuals have individual opinions.

Is it during composition, after composition, or a combination of during and after?","output":"When is the best time to format? Is it during composition, after composition, or a combination of during and after? I do basic paragraph and font attribute formatting as I compose; leaving more complex formatting and all page formatting until later. With Microsoft Word, a template will bring in the typical style and page layout formatting needed for the different types of document. Even if you don‚Äôt create (or use) customized templates though, do learn & use the keyboard shortcuts to apply built-in heading styles: Ctrl-Alt-1 applies Heading 1; Ctrl-Alt-2 applies Heading 2, etc. Why use heading styles? Word can use the outline levels built in to the 9 heading styles to help structure your document. The ‚ÄúHeadings‚Äù tab of the navigation pane (Ctrl-F in recent versions) will show your document heading levels to let you easily jump from one to another; the Outline view lets you collapse your document by heading levels and use drag & drop to reorganize and promote/demote heading levels; and a table of contents can be built automatically from the heading levels. Moreover, cross-references can be created to make automatic hyperlinks to specific headings or to the page number where they exist. What other styles have shortcuts? You can add meaningful shortcuts to any style definition, and even set them up so they automatically switch to another style after you press Enter. I typically like a paragraph immediately following my second and third level headings to have no first line indent, but all other paragraphs to have a first line indent. This is easy to manage with styles, and can be done automatically without needing to remember shortcut keys. To do this, I use the Modify Style dialog (Shift-Ctrl-Alt-s to display the Styles dialog, then right-click a style‚Äôs name to choose ‚ÄúModify‚Ä¶‚Äù). For both my Heading 2 and Heading 3 styles, the ‚ÄúStyle for following paragraph‚Äù option is set to the Body Text style.For my Body Text style, the ‚ÄúStyle for following paragraph‚Äù option is set to the Body Text First Indent style. For the formatting, I set the paragraph‚Äôs first line indent to zero. While in the Modify Style dialog, I also use Format > Shortcut key‚Ä¶ to create a shortcut of Alt-B,T so I can apply the Body Text style elsewhere if needed.For my Body Text First Indent style, the ‚ÄúStyle for following paragraph‚Äù option is left to the default (i.e. continue with the Body Text First Indent style). I also create a shortcut of Alt-B,F so I can apply it elsewhere. Here‚Äôs what the Modify Style dialog looks like with the ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù option and shortcut key being set: Now as I type, I can press Ctrl-Alt-2 to start typing a heading level 2. When I press Enter to finish it, Word will use my modified style definition to automatically set the next paragraph as Body Text. When I press Enter to end that first paragraph, its definition will automatically set the next paragraph as Body Text First Indent. When that firs paragraph is ended by pressing Enter, the next paragraph will be set as Body Text First Indent ‚Äî and that formatting will stay in effect for all paragraphs until I specifically set another style. Note that in cases where a heading level 3 immediately follows a heading level 2, I do need to use Ctrl-Alt-2 to override the automatic ‚ÄúBody Text‚Äù style that would be applied by the Heading 2. The fine details for formatting are done after the content is basically finished. If other people are reviewing the document, I tend to use fairly basic formatting using the built-in style names, then work on the final design details later. Styles can be modified, so there is seldom any need to create custom ones."},{"instruction":"the U.S., you need a birth certificate to get your Social Security card, and you need your Social Security card to get your birth certificate, so what do you do if you have neither?","output":"Birth certificates are issued at birth.
