Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above.

Moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere, Sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller, taking it's time, establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. Director Llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. But this film is far better than his Stallone/Stone travesty The Specialist. Billy Zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture.

The controversy may lead to increased calls for greater transparency and accountability from public sector agencies, where executive compensation has become a contentious issue. Some argue that executives in the public sector should be held to more stringent standards of accountability than their private sector counterparts, given that public funds are at stake. However, others argue that it is important to attract top talent by providing competitive salaries, and that public agencies need the flexibility to match market rates in order to do so.

This period began in the late 16th century and lasted until the early 17th century. During this time, Matthias and Frederick III/V, who were both members of the Habsburg dynasty, were vying for control of various territories in central Europe. The rivalry between Matthias and Frederick III/V had its roots in their family history. Both men were descendants of the Habsburgs, a powerful family that had ruled much of Europe for centuries. However, Matthias and Frederick III/V represented different branches of the family and had conflicting claims to various titles and lands. The rivalry between the two men began in earnest when Matthias was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1612. This position gave him considerable influence over many of the territories that were in dispute between him and Frederick III/V. The two men engaged in a protracted struggle for control of these territories, which included parts of Germany, Austria, and Hungary. The rivalry between Matthias and Frederick III/V was complicated by the fact that they were related. This made it difficult for them to engage in open warfare against each other without risking damage to the reputation of the Habsburg dynasty as a whole. Instead, they engaged in a series of diplomatic maneuvers, alliances, and betrayals in an attempt to gain the upper hand. In the end, Matthias emerged as the clear winner in this conflict. By the time of his death in 1619, he controlled most of the territories that had been in dispute between him and Frederick III/V. Although the rivalry between the two men had been intense, it did not significantly weaken the Habsburg dynasty as a whole.

Tuning your bow ensures that your arrows fly straight, true, and consistent. However, tuning a bow can seem complicated and intimidating, especially if you're a beginner. But the truth is, tuning your bow is a straightforward process that we'll break down for you. Firstly, you need to install all accessories on your bow, such as sights, stabilizer, and quiver, and attach them securely. Once you've installed your accessories, you can begin tuning your bow. The first step is to center your arrow rest with the nocking point on your bowstring using a bow square or other tool. Ensure that the arrow rest is perfectly aligned with the center of the bow so that each shot is consistent. The next step is to make sure that you're using the correct arrows for your bow setup. Your arrows' weight and length should correspond with your bow's draw length, draw weight, and the arrow rest height. Using the wrong arrows can lead to inaccurate shots and damage your bow. After you've installed your accessories and selected the correct arrows, you can start the tuning process. Frame a piece of paper a few feet in front of an arrow backstop. Shoot a fletched arrow through the paper into the arrow backstop. This will create a hole in the paper that you can examine for tuning adjustments. Use the appearance of the hole in the paper to adjust the nocking point on the bowstring. If the hole appears high on the paper, move the nocking point up. If it appears low, move it down. Ensure that the adjustment is minimal, as too much movement can cause significant changes in your arrow's flight path. Additionally, if you notice side-to-side wobbling, adjust the level positioning of your arrow rest to eliminate the issue. Test your bow again from further away to ensure that your adjustments have improved the flight trajectory. In conclusion, tuning your bow is a simple process that can be achieved by installing accessories, centering the arrow rest, selecting the correct arrows, and examining the hole in the paper after shooting. Ensuring that your bow is correctly tuned will significantly increase your shooting accuracy, consistency, and overall enjoyment of the sport."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: A.S.

He threw touchdown passes to players on both teams, but it was with the Colts that he had the most success. During his 13 seasons with the Colts, Manning threw touchdown passes to a total of 39 different players. His most prolific target was future Hall of Fame receiver Marvin Harrison, who caught 112 touchdown passes from Manning. Other notable players who caught touchdown passes from Manning in Indianapolis include Reggie Wayne (67), Dallas Clark (44), and Edgerrin James (11). After missing the entire 2011 season due to injury, Manning was released by the Colts and signed with the Broncos.

The old line of thinking, based on research done in the 1980s, is that a great white could snack on, say, a 60pound seal pup and go six weeks without another meal. As it turns out, it's more like two weeks, max, say researchers at the University of Tasmania, reports AFP. In fact, the sharks are likely to be feeding every few days, not every few weeks. The findings are based on a meticulous study of a dozen sharks that factored in their metabolic rate and swim speeds. So why was the old study so far off? The best guess is that they picked a shark that probably wasn't working very hard at the time when they did it, one of the new researchers tells Australia's ABC News. Expand this summary.","output":"According to a new study, great white sharks are hungrier and need to eat more frequently than previously thought. Previous research from the 1980s suggested that the sharks could go up to six weeks without eating after consuming a 60-pound seal pup. However, the University of Tasmania's latest research found that the sharks actually need to eat every few days, with a maximum of two weeks between meals. The study's conclusions were based on research into a dozen sharks that took into account their metabolic rates and swim speeds. The researchers have suggested that the earlier study might have been affected by factors such as the health of the shark."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Select a pair of sharp, clean scissors, preferably barber's shears.

To get a polished look, start by selecting a pair of sharp, clean scissors. Barber's shears are a great choice, as they are specifically designed for trimming hair. Next, use a comb as a guide to help guide your scissors and prevent uneven cuts. Start on one side of your face and trim slowly and carefully, taking care not to remove too much hair at once. Repeat the process on the other side of your face, making sure to keep the lengths on both sides even. If you have a mustache, spend some time carefully trimming any stray hairs and shaping it to your desired length and style. For those with a beard or goatee, use the scissors to shape these areas as well, being sure to keep everything symmetrical. When you're satisfied with the length and shape of your facial hair, finish by using the scissors to create a clean edge around the perimeter. This will give your beard or mustache a polished look and help it to look well-groomed. In summary, with the right tools and techniques, it's easy to groom your facial hair at home. By using a pair of sharp, clean scissors and a comb as a guide, you can achieve a stylish and polished look."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called engram or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting aftereffects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007).

He was born into slavery but eventually bought his freedom and became an entrepreneur and community leader. Vesey was also a devout Christian who attended the Second Presbyterian Church in Charleston, South Carolina. However, despite his dedication to his faith, Vesey was deeply dissatisfied with some of the practices and beliefs of his church. One of the main things that Vesey did not like about his church was its support for slavery. The Second Presbyterian Church, like many churches in the South, saw slavery as a necessary institution sanctioned by God. They used biblical passages to justify the ownership of slaves and believed that it was their duty to convert enslaved people to Christianity. Vesey, who had experienced the horrors of slavery first-hand, could not reconcile these beliefs with his own understanding of Christ's teachings of love and equality. Vesey was also critical of the Second Presbyterian Church's elitism and exclusivity. The church was made up of white, wealthy and powerful members who were mostly indifferent to the plight of enslaved people. Vesey felt that the church was more concerned with maintaining its own power and status than with serving the needs of its community. He longed for a more inclusive and compassionate Christian community that would work towards the betterment of all people, regardless of their race or social status. Finally, Vesey was troubled by the lack of agency that enslaved and African-American members had in the church. Although he attended the Second Presbyterian Church, Vesey was not allowed to participate in decision-making or hold leadership positions. He felt that his voice and the voices of other marginalized members were not valued or heard, and that the church did not reflect the diversity of God's creation. In response to his dissatisfaction with the Second Presbyterian Church, Vesey helped to establish the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church) in Charleston. The AME Church was founded by African-Americans and was committed to advancing the cause of social justice and equality. Vesey found in the AME Church a community that shared his values and beliefs and was inclusive of all people, regardless of their race or social status. In conclusion, Vesey's objections to the Second Presbyterian Church were rooted in his experiences as an enslaved person and his understanding of Christ's teachings of love and equality. He sought a more compassionate, inclusive and equitable Christian community that recognized the worth and dignity of all people. Vesey's criticisms of the Second Presbyterian Church and his leadership in the founding of the AME Church were a testament to his faith and his commitment to justice and equality for all."},{"instruction":"What is the name of the toning that produces brown and white photographs?

The findings of this study are eagerly anticipated, as they are likely to shed light on the effects of different foods on the human body. One food item that will be included in the study is the deep-fried Mars bar, which has been a Scottish favourite since it was first introduced in 1995. This particular food item has become synonymous with Scotland's 'high-fat, high-sugar diet'. Whilst it may be considered a tasty treat by many, the deep-fried Mars bar has been heavily criticised by health experts due to its high calorie content and potential negative impact on heart health. It is hoped that the findings of this study will help provide a greater understanding of the effects of high-fat, high-sugar diets on individuals, and potentially lead to changes in eating habits. It's important to note that whilst the deep-fried Mars bar may be a symbol of Scotland's high-fat, high-sugar diet, it is not the only food item associated with this. Other traditional Scottish dishes, such as haggis and shortbread, are also high in saturated fat and sugar. Scotland has also been noted for having one of the highest rates of obesity in Europe, with excessive consumption of such foods thought to be a major contributing factor. It remains to be seen what the findings of this study will reveal. However, it is hoped that it will encourage individuals to rethink their eating habits and make healthier choices for the benefit of their long-term health.

The good news is that with practice, anyone can improve their reading skills and even learn to enjoy it. Here are some tips on how to do so. Firstly, practice a little every day. Like any skill, reading requires regular exercise to improve. Set aside a few minutes each day to read something, whether it's a news article, a short story, or a book. Over time, you'll start to notice an improvement in your reading comprehension and speed. Secondly, start with easier material. If you find yourself struggling with reading, don't start with challenging texts. Choose something you are interested in and that has a lower reading level, such as children's books or young adult fiction. This helps build your confidence and gradually challenges you. Thirdly, use your finger or an index card to set the pace. One common challenge many people face when reading is maintaining a steady pace. Using your finger or an index card to guide you can help you track your progress and stay focused. Fourthly, read for longer periods of time to improve your focus. Start by reading for 10 minutes, then gradually increase the time each day. This helps improve your focus and concentration, making it easier to read for longer periods of time in the future. Fifthly, change your attitude towards reading. Many people find reading boring, but this is often because they view it as a chore instead of a pleasure. Try to change your attitude towards reading by finding topics that interest you or books that you enjoy. You may be surprised to find that reading can be enjoyable! Lastly, know when to slow down. Reading isn't a race, and it's okay to take your time. If you find yourself struggling with a particular text, slow down and take the time to understand it. You'll gain more from the reading if you take it slowly and absorb the material. In conclusion, improving your reading skills is a matter of practice and perseverance. By practicing regularly, starting with easier material, using aids to set the pace, reading for longer periods, changing your attitude towards reading, and knowing when to slow down, you can improve your reading comprehension, speed and even come to enjoy reading!"},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"positive"},{"instruction":"ere is a premise: White dog leaping across a small body of water.

It is high in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, lignans, and other beneficial nutrients that can improve digestive health, heart health, and overall well-being. However, to get the most out of flaxseed, it is important to prepare and consume it in the right way. One of the most important things to keep in mind when using flaxseed is to always grind it before use. While whole flaxseed is difficult for the body to digest, grinding it makes it easier to absorb all of its nutrients. You can grind flaxseed using a coffee grinder, or you can buy ground flaxseed in bulk. Once you have your ground flaxseed, there are many ways to incorporate it into your diet. One popular method is to mix it with other liquids, like water or juice, and drink it straight. Another option is to soak the seeds before adding them to smoothies or juices. This helps to soften the outer shell of the seeds and make them easier to digest. Flaxseed can also be sprinkled on top of cereal or yogurt, or added to salads and soups as a crunchy topping. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even bake with flaxseed! Try adding it to muffins, cookies, and cakes for an extra boost of flavor and nutrition. No matter how you choose to consume flaxseed, it is important to store it properly. Keep ground flaxseed in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, and refrigerate whole seeds to prevent spoilage. In conclusion, flaxseed is an excellent addition to any diet, and with a little bit of preparation and creativity, you can easily incorporate it into your daily routine. So next time you're at the grocery store, be sure to pick up some flaxseed and start reaping the many benefits of this superfood!"},{"instruction":"Paragraph: Mary loved walking through the woods with her dog, Max.

It was not just the fact that he had died, but the circumstances surrounding his death that left a bitter taste in the mouths of the people that knew him. Reports revealed that Private Chen had been bullied by fellow soldiers who consistently racially teased him. This is a very unfortunate state of affairs that should never have occurred. It is disheartening that people can still be based upon the color of their skin or their origin in this day and age. It is even more concerning that these beliefs are harbored by those who are supposed to protect us. The military has always been an institution that prides itself on its principles of honor, respect, and camaraderie. These are values that are ingrained within its members from day one, and it is particularly disappointing that some have failed to adhere to them. The tragedy of Private Chen's death underscores the importance of the military inculcating and enforcing its values of respect towards others. It is incumbent upon military leadership to maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination or harassment in the armed forces. The onus is on all members of the military to uphold these values and propagate them to those around them. While there are undoubtedly cases of bullying and harassment that routinely go unreported, educating soldiers that they shouldn't be afraid to come forward is crucial to breaking this vicious cycle. The death of Private Danny Chen is a stark reminder that the military must do more to ensure that its values are upheld by all.

He is one of the most accomplished kickers in NFL history, with numerous records and accolades to his name. One of the most impressive statistics associated with Carney is his total field goal yards, which serves as a testament to his longevity and consistency. Over the course of his career, John Carney kicked a total of 2,062 field goals, which ranks third all-time behind only Adam Vinatieri and Morten Andersen. Those field goals were worth a total of 8,477 yards, which is another mark of his remarkable accuracy and power. While Carney was primarily known for his ability to make shorter kicks with great accuracy, he still managed to convert a significant number of longer attempts throughout his career. Breaking down Carney's field goal yards by distance reveals even more of his impressive resume. He made 1,076 field goals from 39 yards or shorter, which accounted for more than half of his yards. Another 664 field goals came from distances ranging from 40 to 49 yards, while 284 came from 50 yards or more. Carney's longest career field goal was a 57-yarder he made in a game against the Atlanta Falcons in 1998. Of course, field goals are just one part of the kicking game, and Carney also had a successful career as a kickoff specialist. He kicked off 2,055 times, with an average distance of 63.0 yards and 264 touchbacks. He also punted the ball 3 times for an average of 29.3 yards. When it comes to total field goal yards, John Carney's impressive career speaks for itself. His 8,477 yards are a testament to his tireless work ethic, incredible skill, and his ability to maintain a high level of performance over the course of more than two decades in the NFL.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"A new study from Oxford University has revealed that children conceived using in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be at a higher risk of developing asthma. The study, which is the first of its kind in the UK, found that IVF children were twice as likely to develop wheezing and up to four times more likely to have taken anti-asthma medicine by the age of five. While the reasons for this increased risk are not yet fully understood, the study suggests that factors like the severity of infertility and the use of fertility treatments may play a role. However, the researchers caution that further research is needed to fully understand the link. The study included over 18,000 children born between 2000 and 2002, of which 1,556 were conceived using IVF. The children were followed up to the age of five to assess their risk of developing asthma and other respiratory conditions. The findings are of particular concern given the increasing use of IVF in the UK and around the world. According to the authors of the study, around 2-4% of all births in the UK are now the result of IVF, and this number is expected to continue rising. While IVF is generally considered to be a safe and effective method of assisted reproduction, the study highlights the importance of monitoring the long-term health outcomes of children born using this technique. The researchers stress that parents of IVF children should not be unduly alarmed by the study's findings, but should instead work closely with their doctors to monitor their child's respiratory health and seek medical attention if necessary. Overall, the study provides important new insights into the potential health implications of IVF, and underscores the need for continued research into this important area of reproductive medicine."},{"instruction":"ly a thorough eye examination can diagnose the corneal diseases.

Scott is mentally ill and should not be put to death' Panetti and his exwife have a daughter Amanda who is now in her early twenties.","output":"Scott Panetti: Schizophrenia and the Death Penalty Scott Panetti, a man diagnosed with schizophrenia, was convicted of killing his estranged wife's parents in Texas in 1992. His case became a focal point for mental health and death penalty advocates, as his illness raised questions about his competency and ability to understand the consequences of his actions. In a last-minute effort to save his life, Panetti's lawyers made an appeal on the basis of his mental health, stating that he \\"stands on the razor's edge of competency.\\" Panetti, now 56, has claimed that Satan is working through Texas prison officials to execute him and prevent him from preaching the Gospel. Panetti's mental health struggles began 14 years prior to the killings, when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has since exhibited symptoms of delusion and paranoia, including claiming in 6th grade that he had a fight with future President Obama at a Chicago museum, and that his tooth told him to write a letter of apology. During his trial, Panetti acted as his own lawyer and dressed in a purple cowboy suit. He attempted to subpoena Jesus and JFK and frequently went on nonsensical tangents. Despite these clear manifestations of his illness, Panetti was found competent to stand trial and was ultimately sentenced to death. In 1999, Panetti's ex-wife Sonja Alvarado petitioned against his trial, stating that \\"Scott is mentally ill and should not be put to death.\\" She also stated that she does not hate Scott, but rather hates what he did. Panetti and Alvarado have a daughter, Amanda, who is now in her early twenties. The case of Scott Panetti highlights the need for greater understanding and compassion towards those with mental illness within the criminal justice system. It also raises important questions about the ethics of executing someone who is not able to fully comprehend the consequences of their actions due to mental illness."},{"instruction":"Reuters Circuit City Stores Inc. , onFriday reported a smaller quarterly loss as it kept a tightrein on expenses and demand increased for digital televisions,notebook computers and other popular products.

Two of the most common expressions that originated from the First World War are \\"plonker\\" and \\"cushy.\\" Plonker is a derogatory term used to describe someone who is foolish or stupid. It is believed to have originated from the French word \\"plonk,\\" which means cheap wine. The soldiers would refer to their officers as \\"plonkers\\" because they believed they were as cheap and easily replaceable as the wine they drank. The term \\"cushy\\" is used to describe something that is easy and comfortable. It is believed to have originated from the Hindustani word \\"khush,\\" which means pleasant or agreeable. The soldiers would refer to a position that was safe and comfortable as a \\"cushy\\" one. The Oxford English Dictionary is appealing for help from the public to find more examples of First World War slang. They believe that there are still many expressions that have not yet been documented, and they are asking people to come forward with any information they may have. The First World War was a time of great hardship and suffering, but it also gave birth to many expressions that have stood the test of time.

If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river.

Targeting Russia's business community would be one way of sapping their support for President Putin, she says. But she says Europe would have a hard time keeping its factories going without power from the east. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Europe must prepare itself for the fact that imposing sanctions on Russia will hurt both sides, warns financial journalist Nina dos Santos. Although targeted sanctions against Putin's supporters may be one way to weaken his grip on power, Europe may struggle to maintain its industries without the energy provided by Russia. Sanctions have long been used as a diplomatic tool for punishing and pressuring rogue regimes, with the aim of changing their behavior. However, they often come at a cost, as they can cause economic pain to both the target country and to the countries imposing the sanctions. In the case of Russia, dos Santos suggests that sanctions against its business community could be used as a way of undermining Putin's support base. However, she acknowledges that Europe is heavily dependent on Russian energy supplies, which could cause significant economic disruption if reduced. Europe has been trying to reduce its reliance on Russian energy for years, but progress has been slow. Russia is still the largest supplier of natural gas to the EU, providing about a third of its total gas imports. While Europe has made some strides in diversifying its energy sources, the transition is far from complete. The potential impact of reduced energy supplies on European businesses is a cause for concern. Factories and other industries require a steady supply of energy to operate, and any disruption could lead to major economic consequences. Dos Santos also notes that Russia may respond to sanctions by cutting off energy supplies, leaving Europe in a difficult position. With these challenges in mind, dos Santos suggests that Europe needs to carefully consider the potential costs of imposing sanctions on Russia. While targeted sanctions may be effective in weakening Putin's grip on power, they could also have unintended consequences that harm European businesses and economies. Ultimately, the decision to impose sanctions will require a delicate balancing act between diplomatic pressure and economic stability. Europe must be prepared to accept the potential costs of sanctions while also exploring alternative energy sources and reducing its reliance on Russia in the long term."},{"instruction":"Q: What town is The Crow and Gate located in?

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"\\"Overnight Stay at Hampton by Hilton London Gatwick Airport: A Convenient and Affordable Option\\" Travelling can be a stressful experience, especially with the added inconvenience of airport parking. However, opting for an overnight stay at a hotel near the airport can be a civilised and sensible choice. At Hampton by Hilton London Gatwick Airport, families of four can enjoy a comfortable night's sleep for just £84, with the added convenience of being able to check their bags in the night before. One major advantage of staying at Hampton by Hilton is that the rooms are sound-proofed, ensuring a good night's sleep before a busy day of travel. The hotel also offers a no-quibble guarantee, so guests can feel confident that they are getting the best possible value for their money. When considering the cost of an overnight stay versus the cost of airport parking, it's important to factor in the additional benefits of staying at a hotel. Not only do guests get to enjoy a comfortable bed, they also avoid the hassle of finding a parking space and lugging their bags from the car to the terminal. This can make the cost of an overnight stay at Hampton by Hilton equivalent, or even less than, the cost of airport parking. However, it's important to note that not all hotels near the airport are created equal. Opting for a hotel that is a few miles away may seem like a money-saving option, but can actually end up being a false economy. The additional cost of transport to and from the hotel, as well as the added stress of travelling further, can make the overall cost of the trip higher than expected. In conclusion, an overnight stay at Hampton by Hilton London Gatwick Airport is a convenient and affordable option for families travelling from Gatwick. With comfortable rooms, a no-quibble guarantee, and bags that can be checked in early, guests can enjoy a stress-free, restful night's sleep before embarking on their journey."},{"instruction":"ere is a premise: She is hitting the tennis ball over the line.

Make good eye contact and use open, welcoming gestures. If you want to show interest in a girl, consider buying her a gift that shows you are paying attention to her likes and interests. This personal gesture can be as simple as buying her favorite candy or book. By taking the time to get to know her likes and preferences, you show that you genuinely care about her as an individual. On the occasion where she may be upset or crying, offering her a tissue can show her that you are there for her during her emotional moments. This simple gesture can go a long way in making her feel more comfortable and cared for. When comforting her, don't be afraid to give her a hug or cuddle up together. Studies have shown that physical touch can lead to feelings of comfort and security. Just make sure you approach this with respect and consent - ask her if she's okay with physical contact before offering it.

This kick broke the previous record of 63 yards held by Tom Dempsey (1970), Jason Elam (1998), and Sebastian Janikowski (2011). The second longest field goal was made by David Akers of the San Francisco 49ers on September 9, 2012. Akers nailed a 63-yarder to tie the previous record, but he did so in a much more challenging setting - Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Akers' kick was instrumental in the 49ers' victory over the Packers that day. Making a field goal of this length is an incredible feat that requires a combination of power, accuracy, and favorable conditions. Kickers must have plenty of leg strength to drive the ball that far, but they also need to be precise enough to send the ball through the narrow goalposts. Additionally, altitude and weather conditions can play a significant role in a kicker's success. Although these two kicks stand as the longest field goals ever made, several other kickers have come close to breaking the record throughout NFL history.
