These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement.

Talk to people about it. Turn it into a strength. Change how others think. Denounce accusations as lies.","output":"Forgiveness is an essential component of positive human interactions. However, while it is important to forgive, it is equally important to accept that people might not forget our past mistakes. Whether we have hurt someone or made a mistake that impacted others, it is natural for people to remember it, and it is our responsibility to acknowledge that. Instead of hiding and hoping that people forget, we can choose to talk to people about it. We can acknowledge our mistake or wrongdoing and express our remorse. By doing this, we can turn a negative interaction into a positive one. When we own up to our actions, people are more likely to forgive us, and we can start to rebuild trust. Moreover, we can learn to turn our past mistakes into strengths. Once we have owned up to our mistakes, we can reflect on why we made them in the first place. Perhaps we can use these learnings to become better people and prevent similar mistakes in the future. This way, we can take negativity and turn it into a positive learning experience. As we move forward, we can also try to change others' perceptions. People might hold negative opinions based on our past mistakes, but we can work to show them the person we are today. Through our positive actions and interactions, we can prove to people that we have grown and evolved. Finally, if someone accuses us of something that we didn't do, we can denounce their accusations as lies. It is important to stand up for ourselves and not let false accusations ruin our reputation. By standing our ground and defending our character, we can show others that we will not tolerate false accusations. In conclusion, when it comes to past mistakes, it is important to accept that people might not forget. However, by talking about it, turning it into a strength, changing others' perceptions, and denouncing false accusations, we can take control of our situation and move forward with positivity."},{"instruction":"Q: In what century was the Newer Orthography created?

The field, which was officially launched by Brazilian legend Pele, features around 200 energy-capturing tiles that convert the kinetic energy produced by players into electricity to power the field's lights. This innovative technology uses a piezoelectric system that generates an electrical charge when pressure is applied to certain materials, allowing the players' movements to be converted into a source of renewable energy. This is not the first time that energy-capturing tiles have been utilized for public spaces. Airports, shopping centres, and other public spaces have already recognized the potential of this technology to provide sustainable energy solutions. However, this is the first time that such tiles have been put to use in a football field. The possibility of generating energy from human movement brings up an innovative way to approach urban design and sustainability. As well as aiding in the development of sustainable energy sources, this technology can provide other benefits too. For instance, the football pitch stays illuminated even during blackouts or power outages, ensuring continued use for the sports community. The energy that the tiles capture can also be harnessed to power communities and even cities. Imagine harnessing the energy produced by a city to power itself. Innovations like these are an exciting example of how we can engage with sustainable ideologies to make a lasting impact on the planet. The energy-capturing tiles that take advantage of human motion are an excellent display of how the renewal of old technologies and practices can lead to new and innovative ideas.

Be prepared to call in a veterinarian.","output":"Foaling: When to Observe and Call a Veterinarian Foaling is a delicate process, and every horse owner should be aware of the signs that indicate the onset of labor. The first signs of foaling include restlessness, sweating, and frequent urination. When these signs are observed, horse owners must keep a close eye on their mares, but not interfere with the second stage of labor. This is when the actual foaling takes place, and it must not be interrupted unless there is an emergency. During the second stage of labor, mares may lie down on their sides and push, while the amniotic sac breaks, and the foal's legs and hooves become visible. This is a critical moment that requires owners to exercise patience and restraint, as the mare may take several hours to safely deliver the foal. However, owners must also be prepared to call a veterinarian if they notice any signs of distress in the mare or foal, such as prolonged contractions, a breached foal, or difficulty breathing. A veterinarian plays a crucial role in ensuring that the foaling process occurs smoothly and that both the mare and foal are healthy. If owners are not confident about foaling, they can hire an experienced foaling attendant to assist with the delivery. However, it is essential to note that owners must not attempt to assist with the foaling, as their interference may cause more harm than good. In conclusion, as a horse owner, it is crucial to be aware of the signs of foaling and to keep a close watch on your mare during the second stage of labor without interfering. Additionally, owners must be prepared to call a veterinarian or a foaling attendant immediately if they notice any signs of distress in the mare or foal. By being proactive and cautious, owners can ensure that their horses have a safe and healthy foaling experience."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between Windows and Linux for web hosting?

While they have made efforts to increase security for Shiites, many argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the conflict. In the wake of this latest bombing, there have been calls for increased security measures and for the government to take a stronger stance against extremist groups.

The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies).

Among them are the interview and hiring process of drivers, provision of uniforms for staff members, establishment of clear rules for staff, and the implementation of good employment practices. One crucial step in maintaining a trustworthy transportation service is to hire qualified and skilled drivers. This process involves a thorough interview process that emphasizes the importance of qualifications such as a valid driver's license, a clean driving record, and relevant experience. Additionally, as part of the hiring process, candidates should be vetted for any criminal history, especially those relating to driving offenses. Ensuring that the best drivers are selected is essential in promoting safety and reliable service for customers. Providing uniforms for employees is another critical aspect of proper transportation service management. This step involves creating a recognizable and professional image for the company that reflects a high level of orderliness and structure. Uniforms should be comfortable, practical, and designed to withstand the rigors of daily work, such as easy maintenance and washing. By providing uniforms, employees will have a sense of ownership and pride for their work, making them more committed to delivering exceptional service. Clear rules and guidelines for staff members are essential in creating a respectful work environment. This aspect involves setting clear expectations that are well-communicated to all employees, outlining their responsibilities and what is expected of them. Rules could range from punctuality, dress code, vehicle maintenance, and standards of conduct. Making rules clear from the outset provides a structure that allows for smooth operations and excellent customer experiences. Lastly, good employment practices are essential in creating and maintaining a conducive working environment. Consistently recognizing good work, providing opportunities for growth, and fostering a sense of belonging through inclusive activities or training can motivate employees to provide excellent services. Additionally, providing incentives such as healthcare, retirement benefits, or vacation days can improve the overall quality of life for employees. In conclusion, proper management of a transportation service requires the application of several essential components. These include the hiring process for drivers, provision of uniforms, establishment of clear rules and regulations, and the implementation of good employment practices. By putting these elements into practice, transportation services can improve overall quality, safety, and professionalism, leaving customers feeling satisfied and confident in their service provider."},{"instruction":"The Tree<br>Alex stood at the base of the tree and looked up into the branches.

German, on the other hand, was listed as the eighth most commonly spoken language with just over 1 million speakers. However, if we consider language statistics from different countries or regions, the answer may change. For example, in Germany, German is obviously the most common spoken language, whereas Spanish is not even in the top 10. Similarly, in many Latin American countries, Spanish is the dominant language, and German is not widely spoken. It's important to note that language statistics can vary depending on the source and methodology of the census or survey. Additionally, some individuals may speak more than one language, making it challenging to determine a clear distinction between first and second languages.

Collect larger logs for fuel. Build a teepee structure with the tinder and kindling. Create a fire plough to ignite the kindling and start the fire. Use a fire to keep warm, cook your food, and purify your water.","output":"Starting a fire can be a critical skill for anyone who enjoys outdoor activities such as camping or hiking. With just a few essential tools and materials, building a fire can be a straightforward and rewarding experience. Here's how to create a fire that provides warmth, cooks food, and purifies water: 1. Find tinder: Tinder is the starting material for a fire. Look around for small, dry materials such as leaves, grass, or shredded bark to use as tinder. Ensure that it's as dry as possible to catch the flame easily. 2. Gather kindling: Collect small twigs, dry branches, and other materials to use as kindling. The kindling needs to be dry and thin enough to catch fire quickly but not so thick that it won't ignite. 3. Collect fuel: Larger logs and branches work best as fuel for your fire. Look for dry wood to prevent having to deal with a lot of smoke while you nurture the flame. Avoid using wood prone to putting off sap or that which is wet due to the recent rain. 4. Build a teepee structure: Building a teepee structure is the simplest and most effective way of building a fire. Place the tinder in the center of the fire pit and lean the kindling wood around it loosely in a cone shape, leaving spaces for air to flow through regularly. 5. Create a fire plow: If you don't have matches, creating a fire plow is an excellent alternative. Cut a groove in a flat piece of wood, and rub a stick back and forth in the groove to create friction. This friction will cause heat and eventually a spark, igniting the tinder. 6. Use fire to keep warm: With your fire finally lit, you can use it to keep warm in cold weather conditions. Position yourself close enough to the fire to feel its warmth, but not too close to preserve your clothes and skin. 7. Cook your food: A fire is also suitable for cooking your food. Use your fuel wood as a flame if you have a grill or platter, or craft an improvised cooking surface using available materials like rock surfaces. 8. Purify your water: Finally, use your fire to purify your water. Boiling your water over a fire for about 15 minutes is one of the most effective ways to kill any bacteria, making it ready for consumption. Having the skill to start a fire in the wild is an essential survival skill. By following the steps provided above, you will be able to build a fire and even use it for multiple purposes. Whether it's during camping, hiking, or any other outdoor activity, a fire can keep you warm, cook your food, and purify your water."},{"instruction":"Question: How many South Korean National Assemblyman pledged their allegiance to Seoul?

Whether you're trying to impress a potential employer, build relationships with colleagues, or simply make a good first impression, there are certain things you can do to improve your image. First of all, consider spending time with people who have a positive impact on your image. Surrounding yourself with successful, confident, and well-respected individuals can help boost your own reputation. You can learn a lot from the way they conduct themselves and the way they communicate with others. Dressing to impress is another key factor to improving your image. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing expensive clothes, but rather dressing appropriately for the occasion and ensuring that you look put together. Take the time to groom yourself, style your hair, and choose clothes that flatter your shape and make you feel confident. Another way to leave a lasting impression is to do something that people will remember. This could range from offering a unique perspective in a meeting, to performing a random act of kindness for someone, to simply being consistently reliable and dependable. Whatever it is, make sure it sets you apart from the crowd. While trying to make a good impression, it's also important to stay under control. Avoid excessive drinking or overindulging in food, as this can lead to embarrassing behavior or poor decision-making. Instead, be present in the moment and ensure that you're representing yourself in the best possible light. Knowing your audience is also crucial for improving your image. Consider who you are interacting with and adjust your behavior accordingly. Be mindful of cultural differences that may impact how others perceive you, and try to tailor your communication style to their preferences. Aside from these external factors, basic hygiene is also essential. Observe good personal hygiene habits such as showering, brushing your teeth, and wearing clean clothes to ensure that you're presenting yourself in a positive light. Most importantly, like yourself! Confidence is key when it comes to improving your image. Believe in yourself, your abilities and your worth. Remember to enjoy what you are doing and this will be apparent to those around you. Finally, don't forget to use your sense of humor. Being able to laugh at yourself and tell a good joke can help break down barriers and form connections with others. Just be sure to use good judgment and appropriate humor in different situations. In summary, improving your image involves a combination of factors, such as spending time with positive influences, dressing well, doing something memorable, staying in control, knowing your audience, practicing good hygiene, liking yourself, and using humor. These are simple steps that you can take to become a more confident and memorable person, leaving a positive impression on those you encounter."},{"instruction":"ere is a dialogue: Jenny: Are you protesting with the crowds in Budapest?

New tables were launched by Transport Minister Stephen Hammond.","output":"According to new tables launched by Transport Minister Stephen Hammond, rural Herefordshire is the deadliest place in the UK to drive. The tables reflect the number of fatal road accidents per million vehicle miles travelled in each local authority area. Other rural areas that made the top ten list of deadliest places to drive include Powys, the Isle of Anglesey, Cumbria, and Devon. One reason for this is that rural roads are often narrow and winding, with many blind corners and hidden dips. These roads can be particularly treacherous during bad weather, with ice, snow, and flooding making driving even more challenging. However, it's not just the roads themselves that are a problem. Rural areas often have poorer transport links, which can make it harder for emergency services to reach the scene of an accident quickly. This means that injured drivers and passengers may have to wait longer for medical treatment, which can increase the risk of serious injury or death. There are a number of things that can be done to reduce the risk of accidents on rural roads. For example, local authorities can invest in road safety initiatives, such as installing speed cameras, improving road markings, and providing training for drivers. They can also work to improve public transport links, which could encourage more people to leave their cars at home. In addition, individual drivers can take steps to improve their own safety on the road. This includes making sure that their vehicle is well-maintained, driving at an appropriate speed, and avoiding distractions such as using a mobile phone while driving. Overall, the new tables highlighting the deadliest places to drive in the UK should serve as a wake-up call for both local authorities and individual drivers. By working together, we can help to reduce the number of fatal accidents that occur on our roads, particularly in rural areas where the risks are often highest."},{"instruction":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: a student works with the help of his teacher at a computer","output":"student, works, help, teacher, computer."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

He began building ships and recruiting sailors, but the Boyar Duma's decree was necessary to establish a formal naval force. The new navy was initially called the Russian Baltic Fleet and consisted of four frigates and two smaller ships. It was based in the city of St. Petersburg and commanded by Franz Timmerman, a Dutch captain who had been hired by Peter the Great to help modernize the Russian navy.

Rinsing the almonds ensures that any residue or debris is washed away, making them cleaner and more hygienic to eat. You can also gently rub the almond's skin with your hands to remove any excess fibrous material and further clean them. Your raw almonds are now ready to eat.

Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his Opus Majus. Pierre Duhem's provocative thesis of the Catholic Church's Condemnation of 1277 led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277.

In fact, you can unclog a sink yourself using simple ingredients commonly found in your pantry. All you need is baking soda, vinegar, boiling water, and a pair of rubber gloves. To begin, put on your rubber gloves and push one cup of baking soda down the sink drain. Make sure to distribute it evenly around the drain. Then, pour one cup of vinegar into the opening of the drain. You’ll immediately see some fizzing and bubbling as the vinegar reacts with the baking soda.

While it may not be one of the largest economies in the region, Paraguay has made significant strides in its energy sector over the past few years. Hydropower is a major component of the country's energy mix, and Paraguay has been leveraging this resource to generate electricity for domestic and international consumption. As of 2021, Paraguay co-owns two major hydroelectric power plants with neighboring countries. The first is the Itaipu Dam, which Paraguay shares with Brazil. Itaipu is one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world, with a capacity of 14 GW. The plant was built in the 1980s and provides an important source of electricity for both Brazil and Paraguay. The second hydropower plant is the Yacyretá Dam, which Paraguay co-owns with Argentina. Yacyretá has a capacity of 3.1 GW and was also built in the 1980s. The dam is located on the Paraná River and provides electricity to both Paraguay and Argentina. Both of these hydropower plants have been instrumental in helping Paraguay to become a net exporter of electricity. In fact, the country is one of the largest exporters of electricity in South America, thanks in large part to these two dams. The revenue generated from selling electricity has been an important source of income for the country's economy. However, there have been some concerns about the environmental impact of these dams. Critics argue that building large dams can have negative effects on local ecosystems, particularly in terms of disrupting fish populations and altering river flow. There have also been social and economic concerns related to the displacement of local communities. Despite these challenges, Paraguay has continued to invest in hydropower as a key component of its energy mix. The country has also been exploring other renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to further diversify its energy portfolio. As Paraguay continues to grow and develop, it will be interesting to see how its energy sector evolves and how it balances economic needs with environmental and social considerations."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: i like an oak oak trees yeah Sentence 2: I don't like oak trees.

Furthermore, different sports have different scoring systems, so the number of points by which the Jets lost could vary depending on the sport in question. In American football, for example, the final score is determined by the combined number of touchdowns, field goals, and extra points scored, making the point differential a crucial factor in determining the winner. In basketball, on the other hand, the team that scores the most points within the allotted time wins. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"How many points did the Jets lose by?\\" cannot be answered accurately without further information about a specific game. Nevertheless, it's safe to say that like any other team, the Jets have experienced victories, and losses by different margins."},{"instruction":"@kristinabitch I can't believe shes going to be gone in less than 24 hours.

As a result, several lives have been lost, and many others are still missing. Reports indicate that dozens of people have died in India's northern and eastern parts, while more than 100 people have lost their lives in Nepal. The downpour has caused much damage and destruction, making it one of the worst flood-related incidents that the region has faced in recent years. Many remote villages and towns in the affected regions have been cut off from the outside world, making it challenging for rescue teams to reach the affected people. Thousands of people are still trapped, with limited access to basic necessities such as food, water, and medical care. The situation in Nepal is particularly dire, with the government struggling to cope with the sheer magnitude of the disaster. The Nepalese authorities have appealed for international assistance to help them deal with the situation. The country is still reeling from the devastating 2015 earthquakes, making it even more challenging to recover from the latest calamity. The heavy rains have not only caused massive flooding but also led to landslides, making travel impossible in many places.

The disaster has once again highlighted the need for better disaster management systems and infrastructure in the region. With increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, it is essential to be prepared for such events, especially in countries like India and Nepal. It is important to invest in systems that can provide better warning and evacuation measures, thus minimizing the loss of life.

Here are three tips that can help you improve your chicken-keeping skills. Install a chicken coop: If you haven't already, getting a proper chicken coop is essential for your birds' safety and comfort. A coop provides shelter from the elements, protection from predators, and a place to lay eggs. Make sure that the coop is well ventilated, secure, and spacious enough for your chickens to move around. Try diatomaceous earth: Diatomaceous earth is a natural product that can help prevent pest infestations in your chicken coop. It is made of ground-up fossils and works by dehydrating insects and their larvae. Sprinkle a thin layer of diatomaceous earth around the coop and nesting boxes to prevent fleas, mites, and other pests from bothering your chickens. Be sure to wear a mask and gloves when handling diatomaceous earth, as it can irritate your lungs and skin. Set out sticky traps: If you have a rodent problem in your yard or coop, setting out sticky traps can help control their population. Place the traps near areas where mice or rats are likely to travel, such as around the coop or near food storage. Check the traps regularly, and dispose of them properly to avoid attracting other pests. By following these tips, you can help keep your chickens healthy, happy, and safe. Remember to research, learn, and experiment to find what works best for your particular situation.

Learn a few tricks.","output":"\\"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.\\" This age-old adage can be particularly relevant when it comes to managing our daily lives. One effective way of ensuring productivity and reducing stress is by setting a daily routine. A routine sets a pattern that makes it easier to accomplish tasks with less effort, time and decision-making. This inevitably leads to more time and freedom to explore other areas of interest. Another great way to stay organized is to create a weekly schedule. This is especially useful for those with a busy and demanding work or school schedule. By having a clear picture of upcoming events and obligations for the week, it becomes easier to plan and allocate time accordingly. This prevents last-minute cramming or forgotten commitments that could potentially cause undue stress. Keeping things clean and tidy is also essential to maintaining a harmonious and comfortable living space. Experimenting with different cleaning products can help to find the most effective ones for various tasks. It's also beneficial to be handy around the house, as it eliminates the need for expensive repairs or hiring outside help. Learning the basics of plumbing, electrical work or carpentry can potentially save thousands of dollars in the long run. Organizing one's realm is another great way to maximize space and reduce clutter. This applies not only to our physical living space but also to digital devices and online accounts. A clean and organized laptop or smartphone can save time and stress associated with finding documents and contacts. Lastly, mastering the laundry is a crucial life skill that can potentially save time and money. Learning how to sort clothes, remove stains and properly operate a washing machine can make a significant difference in one's quality of life. Learning a few laundry tricks such as using vinegar to remove odors or reviving faded clothes with salt can also come in handy. In conclusion, incorporating these simple habits into our daily routine can lead to a more organized, efficient, and stress-free life. It takes time and practice to make these habits stick, but the benefits will be well worth it."},{"instruction":"Does At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. contain the correct answer to At the lowest level of the brain and spinal cord, are what areas?

Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.:885 Now answer this question: Follicles inside a male insect's reproductive system connect to what?","output":"Follicles inside a male insect's reproductive system connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens."},{"instruction":"Those fled back to the friars upset at the loss of their companions What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"Those fled back to the friars, upset at the loss of their companions."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Adam has a stomach flu. .","output":"Person 1: How are you feeling today, Adam?

This has been a fascinating discovery for astronomers who are always keen to learn more about these cosmic phenomena. Abell 30 is a planetary nebula, which means it is made up of a glowing gas shell that surrounds a central star. This type of nebula occurs when a star enters the final stages of its life and begins to shed its outer layers. As the star's core shrinks and heats up, it ionizes the surrounding gas, making it glow brightly. Abell 30 has already shed its outer layers and created its gassy shell. However, it has recently been discovered that the nebula has burst back into life, casting more gas shells out into the surrounding space. This is an exciting development for astronomers as it suggests that the life of a planetary nebula may not be as straightforward as once thought. The fate of Abell 30 is thought to mimic that which probably awaits our own solar system in a few billion years. As our sun begins to run out of fuel, it will expand into a red giant, engulfing the inner planets before shedding its outer layers and creating a planetary nebula. This process takes millions of years to complete, but it will eventually leave behind a white dwarf, which is the remnant core of the star. Studying planetary nebulae like Abell 30 can provide valuable insights into the future of our own solar system. By understanding the processes that occur during the final stages of a star's life, we can gain a better understanding of the universe around us. Abell 30's recent burst of activity has given astronomers a lot to think about and it is sure to continue to be the subject of much research in the years to come."},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: The Exel strap World Cup offers individual adjustment options and a very easy use.","output":"TheExelstrapWorldCupoffersindividualadjustmentoptionsandaveryeasyuse."},{"instruction":"Same meaning?

These buttons can be incredibly useful in activating objects, such as doors or dispensers, without having to physically interact with them. To use a stone button, simply place it on the side of a block. However, it is important to ensure that the button is placed next to the object that requires the charge, such as a door or dispenser. Once placed, players can interact with the button by pressing it, which will activate the object it is connected to. Aside from doors and dispensers, there are many other items that can benefit from the use of a stone button. For example, players may choose to use a button to activate a piston or to turn on a redstone lamp. Experimenting with different objects and setups can lead to some creative and practical uses for stone buttons. It is important to note that players cannot create stone buttons themselves. They can only be found naturally formed in strongholds. Therefore, players should keep an eye out for them while exploring and make sure to pick them up when they come across them. In conclusion, stone buttons can be a valuable tool for players to activate objects in Minecraft. By placing the button on the side of a block, and ensuring it is placed next to the object requiring the charge, players can activate doors, dispensers, pistons, and more. While they cannot be generated by players, they can be found naturally formed in strongholds.

His mother is depressed, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister is somewhat accepting. The relationship looks good with his boyfriend/exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn't mean anything. Our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves, dumping his new lover and starting over. We are left with him starting over and viewing, not participating, in happiness. So maybe things will go better for him in the future. The ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so I will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

It details a sensor that detects physical activity and emits odours. A builtin spray would activate and a fan would direct the fragrance. This could be used to counteract the smell of sweat, for example. Wearable sensor can also provide directions to avoid friends that could be ‘offended’ by any odour emitted. And users would be able to change the fragrance, or stop it being released. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Google has been awarded a patent for a unique wearable sensor that can detect physical activity and emit fragrances to counteract unpleasant odours. The patent, filed in August 2012, details a built-in spray that can be activated and controlled by a fan to direct the fragrance. This innovation could be used to combat the smell of sweat after physical exercise, for example. The sensor is also designed to provide users with directions on how to avoid friends who could be offended by any odours emitted. This feature is particularly useful for individuals who suffer from body odour or who are sensitive to strong fragrances. Additionally, users would have the ability to change or stop the fragrance being released altogether. The technology introduced by Google can revolutionize the fragrance industry and improve the overall hygiene of individuals. The ability to detect physical activity and adjust the fragrance accordingly has the potential to provide an optimal user experience. This new technology will eventually lead to creating personalized fragrances for wearers, ensuring that their personal scent is unique to them. While the technology raises concerns about privacy and the ethics behind tracking user activities, the potential benefits could outweigh the negative aspects. With Google constantly pushing the boundaries of technology, it will be interesting to see how this patent will be implemented and bring even more innovative products to the market."},{"instruction":"Read this: Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice.
