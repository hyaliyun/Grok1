Brady, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, threw his second longest touchdown pass during the 2011 NFL season while playing for the New England Patriots. The pass was an 99-yard bomb to wide receiver Wes Welker during a game against the Miami Dolphins. This impressive feat put Brady in the record books, as it is the second longest touchdown pass in football history. The longest touchdown pass, which was thrown by Peyton Manning in 2004, was one yard longer at 100 yards. Of course, there are many other quarterbacks who have thrown long touchdown passes over the years. Some notable examples include Warren Moon, who threw an 89-yard touchdown pass in 1990, and Brett Favre, who threw an 82-yard touchdown pass in 2007. However, when it comes to the second longest touchdown pass in football history, it is clear that Tom Brady is the man to beat. In summary, the answer to the question of which player threw the second longest touchdown pass in football history is Tom Brady. His impressive 99-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker in 2011 puts him in the record books and solidifies his place among the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game."},{"instruction":"w do I download videos from Udemy?

However, over time they can become cloudy and yellow, which not only diminishes their effectiveness but also detracts from the overall appearance of the car. In order to maintain the clarity of your headlights, it is important to clean them regularly. Here is a simple guide on how to clean your headlights using 1500 grit paper. The first step in cleaning your headlights is to gather all the necessary supplies. You will need a microfiber cloth, masking tape, 1500 grit sandpaper, and water. You may also want to use a headlight restoration kit, which can be purchased at your local auto supply store. Once you have your supplies, the next step is to wash your headlights thoroughly with soap and water. This will help to remove any dirt, grime, or residue that may have accumulated on the surface of the headlights. Using a microfiber cloth is recommended, as it is gentle and won't scratch the surface of the headlights. After washing your headlights, it is time to apply the 1500 grit paper. Start by taping around the edges of the headlight with masking tape, to protect the surrounding areas from damage. Then, wet the surface of the headlight with water, and gently rub the 1500 grit paper back and forth in a circular motion. Be sure to keep the paper wet to avoid scratching the surface. Repeat this process on the same lens until you have achieved the desired level of clarity. Once finished, rinse the lens with water and dry it thoroughly with a microfiber cloth. In conclusion, maintaining the clarity of your headlights is crucial for both safety and aesthetics. By following these simple steps and using 1500 grit paper, you can easily clean and restore your headlights to their original condition. Remember to wash your headlights regularly to prevent them from becoming cloudy and yellow in the first place."},{"instruction":"Article: This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| A Guatemalan man on Thursday pleaded guilty in U.S. Federal Court in Trenton to attempting to smuggle three kilograms of heroin that had been coated in chocolate.

The answer to that question is actually quite simple: Dick Hoak. Hoak was a standout athlete in high school and played college football at Penn State. He was drafted by the Steelers in the seventh round of the 1961 NFL Draft and went on to have a successful career with the team. In fact, he spent his entire playing career with the Steelers, retiring after the 1970 season. But it was in the team's first season, on October 8, 1933, that Hoak made history by scoring the Steelers' first ever touchdown. The game was against the Giants, and although the Steelers lost 23-2, Hoak's touchdown was a moment to remember. Hoak's touchdown wasn't just significant because it was the team's first; it was also an impressive play. According to reports from the game, Hoak caught a pass from quarterback Jack Spinks and broke several tackles on his way to the endzone. Hoak went on to have a successful career with the Steelers, both as a player and later as a coach. He was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor in 2018, and his legacy continues to live on in the franchise's history.

Touchdowns in football occur when a player carrying the ball crosses the opponent's goal line, or when a receiver catches a pass in the end zone. On the other hand, a field goal is scored by kicking the ball through the opponent's uprights. Field goals are typically attempted when a team is in range to do so but may not be able to score a touchdown. In general, touchdowns tend to result in more yards gained than field goals, as they typically involve longer runs or passes. However, the frequency of scoring plays can also play a role, and a team that attempts many field goals may ultimately gain more yards from those attempts than another team that scores fewer but longer touchdowns. To analyze a specific game, we would need to gather data on the scoring plays and calculate the total yardage gained by touchdowns and field goals. Without this information, it is impossible to definitively say which type of score resulted in more yardage over the entire game. In summary, determining whether there were more yards of touchdowns or field goals over the entire game depends on the specific game being analyzed and the total yardage gained by each type of score."},{"instruction":"Who will win the election in united states?

However, when it comes to planting a pine tree, there are some important things to consider to ensure that the tree thrives in your soil and climate. First, it is important to choose the right species of pine for your soil and climate. Some species are better suited to dry or wet conditions, while others thrive in colder or hotter climates. Researching the most suitable pine species for your area is key in ensuring success. Next, you will need to decide whether to use bare-root seedlings or seedlings grown in a container.

Container-grown seedlings have a more established root system and are easier to plant, but are more expensive.

Make sure to choose a spot that receives enough sunlight and isn't too close to other trees or structures. When it comes time to plant, choose a good day that isn't too hot or too cold.

Tran, who has been working two jobs to keep her family afloat since her parentsâ divorce, was forced to spend a night in a Texas jail due to the insufficient funds her family had to pay off her fines. Despite her trying predicament, Tranâs story generated support and empathy from across the nation. A group in Louisiana even helped raise more than 91,000 for the student, who takes care of her siblings while trying to pursue her dreams of going to college. The tragic plight of Diane Tran highlights the harsh reality that many hardworking students face. Sometimes, life throws unexpected challenges and obstacles in the way of academic success. Tranâs parentsâ divorce and the subsequent financial burden upon her shoulders was enough to derail her academic record, leading to her arrest for truancy. She expressed deep remorse for her absences and assured everyone that she was trying her best to balance her family obligations and schoolwork. Tranâs experience serves as a reminder of the importance of supporting youth in education. It further highlights the need for better education policies that accommodate high-achieving students from challenging backgrounds. By providing support and resources for students like Tran, we can help them to stay on the path to success. In the end, the support that Tran received from all over the country helped her to overcome a deeply troubling situation.

Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called Alpine.

The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.

Coleman, along with many other experts, is optimistic about Libya's economic future due to the population's high literacy rate of nearly 90%. An educated population can significantly contribute to the country's growth by generating new ideas and innovation. Furthermore, Libya has billions of dollars in the bank, which creates a wealth of opportunities for investment and development. This vast amount of capital could be used for creating jobs, infrastructure, and other economic ventures that benefit the country's citizens. In addition to the cash reserves, Libya also has even more funds in frozen foreign assets. These assets provide a vital source of revenue that can be used to finance the country's economic recovery and accelerate growth.

The uncertainty has likely discouraged foreign investors, which could thwart the country's progress.

Digital cameras often use infrared blockers. Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can see intense nearinfrared, appearing as a bright purplewhite color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IRbright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called 'Tray' imaging, which is imaging using farinfrared or terahertz radiation.

During this period, the Russian Black Sea Fleet was operating against Ottoman coastal traffic between Constantinople (currently named Istanbul) and the Caucasus ports, while the Ottoman fleet sought to protect this supply line.

The battle outraged opinion in UK, which called for war. There was little additional naval action until March 1854 when on the declaration of war the British frigate Furious was fired on outside Odessa harbour. In response an AngloFrench fleet bombarded the port, causing much damage to the town. To show support for Turkey after the battle of Sinop, on the 22th of December 1853, the AngloFrench squadron entered the Black Sea and the steamship HMS Retribution approached the Port of Sevastopol, the commander of which received an ultimatum not to allow any ships in the Black Sea.

The decision has caused outrage among the victim's family as they feel the court has put the paedophile's rights above their daughter's safety. The ruling came after the court heard that the sex offender would suffer if he was forced to leave his home. The decision, however, has been met with discontent by those who feel that the court has not prioritised the well-being of the victim. The victim's family has voiced their concern, stating that the court's decision puts the paedophile's rights ahead of their daughter's welfare. The ruling has left them questioning the finality of the justice system and the value placed on the rights of those who have been wronged. The decision to allow the sex offender to continue residing opposite his victim signifies a larger gap in the justice system, which fails to recognise the psychological impact on victims of sexual assault. It also raises the issue of whether a paedophile's rights to freedom are more important than the well-being of their victim. The case highlights the need for judicial reform and a more victim-centred approach. It is essential to listen to the needs of those who have suffered at the hands of their perpetrator and take steps to ensure their safety and well-being. This case is a reminder that we need a justice system that holds perpetrators accountable and protects the vulnerable, not one that prioritises the rights of criminals over those they have harmed."},{"instruction":"Spy Corps is a spy film for Christian families that was written and directed by J David Baker.

Release the bird.","output":"When you come across a bird that needs your help, there are a few things to keep in mind before releasing it back into the wild. One important step is to check the waterproofing of the bird's feathers. Birds rely on their feathers to keep them warm, dry, and buoyant in the water. If their feathers are not properly waterproofed, the bird can become waterlogged, which can be fatal if left untreated. To check if a bird's feathers are waterproofed, you can spray some water over the bird's back and observe if the water beads up and rolls off or if it soaks into the feathers. If the water soaks in, it means that the bird's feathers are not properly waterproofed. In this case, you may need to bring the bird to a wildlife rehabilitation center for professional assistance. Another crucial step in caring for a bird is to provide it with nutritious food and fluids. This is especially important if the bird has been injured, in shock, or dehydrated. Offer the bird small amounts of water or electrolyte solutions, such as Pedialyte, to keep it hydrated. You can also feed the bird with proper bird feed or soaked insects or fruit, depending on the bird species. After the bird has received proper care, it is time to release it back into the wild. Find a safe location with plenty of vegetation and water sources that the bird can easily access. Avoid releasing the bird near roads, buildings, or other hazards that could harm the bird. Then, carefully release the bird and watch as it takes flight back into its natural habitat. By following these steps, you can help ensure that the bird is able to survive and thrive in the wild. Remember that caring for a bird requires patience, knowledge, and proper handling to provide the best possible care."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = Midsummer House, eatType = restaurant, food = Chinese, customer rating = low, near = All Bar One.

Like most Roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant 'Peace of Flaminius' was designed utterly to crush the power of the defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, Philip's fleet was surrendered to Rome, and Macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the citystates of southern Greece, and land in Thrace and Asia Minor. The result was the end of Macedon as a major power in the Mediterranean. What empire won the Second Macedonian War?

Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar.

States, some with GOP governors, had asked for flexibility in handing out funds.","output":"The Romney campaign recently released an advertisement stating that President Obama \\"gutted\\" welfare reform. The crux of their argument is that the Obama administration made changes to the existing welfare rules that would allow states to receive waivers from the current work requirements. The Romney campaign contends that this decision will result in a reduction in the number of people required to work in order to receive welfare benefits. The White House denies this claim, explaining that they did not eliminate the work requirement. Rather, they offered certain states the flexibility to make changes to the program as long as they could meet the same standards of accountability as the original welfare reform. It is true that the White House granted waivers to some states, including several with Republican governors. However, the states receiving the waivers had asked for flexibility in how they could distribute welfare funds to their citizens. The waivers aim to allow states to better use available resources while still requiring accountability for results. Many political analysts see the Romney ad as an attempt to rally his base and cast doubt on Obama's credibility. It is important to note that the welfare reform has been a contentious issue since its inception in the 1990s, with lawmakers from both parties holding differing views on how best to serve those in need.
