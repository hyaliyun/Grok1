Carry a nice purse or satchel with you.","output":"One of the keys to putting together a stylish and polished outfit is choosing the right accessories to accentuate your clothes. When it comes to accessories, there are several elements to consider, including shoes, scarves, ties, belts, jewelry, and purses. By selecting the right pieces, you can elevate your style and make your outfit pop. First things first, always ensure that your shoes are clean and match the outfit you are wearing. A nice pair of shoes can complete your look and make you appear more put together. It's best to stick with neutral colors like black, brown, or nude as they are versatile and can match with a variety of outfits. If you want to add some color to your outfit, consider incorporating scarves, ties, or belts. These accessories can create a pop of color that draws the eye in. Adding a red or patterned scarf to your outfit can make it more interesting and stylish. Belts are also a great way to accentuate your waistline and add a pop of color or pattern. When it comes to jewelry, it's important not to overdo it. Always wear one statement piece at a time, such as a bold necklace or large earrings. This will draw attention to the piece and make it the focal point of your outfit. However, if you want to add some more subtle pieces, bracelets or delicate necklaces can be layered to create a more textured look. Finally, don't forget to carry a nice purse or satchel with you. Your purse or bag is just as much a part of your outfit as your clothing, so make sure it complements your outfit well. A structured bag like a tote or satchel can add sophistication to your look, while a crossbody or clutch can be more casual. In conclusion, accessories are an essential part of any outfit. By choosing the right pieces, you can elevate your style and make your outfit stand out. Remember to keep it simple and focus on one statement piece at a time. With the right accessories, you can feel confident, put together, and ready to take on the day."},{"instruction":"f There are three people sitting on a bench outside a building and one man standing next to it looking at a newspaper., does it logically follow that The people are talking.?

However, with the right instructions, it's a straightforward process that can be done quickly and efficiently. It all starts with the international access code, which is what allows you to dial out of your own country to another. The first step to making an international call is to dial your country's international access code. For example, if you're calling from the United States, the international access code is 011. This code is universal across the country, so no matter where you're located in the United States, dialing 011 will get you started on your international call. Once you've dialed 011, you'll need to enter the country code for the country you're calling. The country code is a three-digit code that identifies each country. For example, the country code for China is 852. You'll need to look up the country code for the country you're calling, as each country has its own unique code. After you've entered the country code, the next step is to enter the phone number of the person you're calling. Be sure to include the area code and any other necessary digits. In most cases, international phone numbers are eight digits long, but this can vary depending on the country. Once you've entered the phone number, simply press the send button to complete your call. Within a few seconds, you'll connect with the person you're calling, and you'll be able to carry out your conversation as usual. If you're calling from another country and need to reach someone in another country, the process is a bit different. You'll need to dial your own country's international access code, followed by the country code of the country you're calling, and then the phone number of the person you're trying to reach. Overall, making an international call doesn't have to be complicated. By following these simple steps, you can quickly and efficiently connect with friends, family, and colleagues around the world."},{"instruction":"pper foot 1: pick up 192123 sts for domino squares as before and work 3 domino squares on upper foot.

Both played in eras known for their dominant ground games, and both enjoyed tremendous success during their respective careers. However, when it comes to the question of total yards, one clearly stands above the other. Over the course of his 10-year career, Jim Brown gained a total of 12,312 rushing yards. This impressive total puts him in the top 10 all-time among NFL rushing leaders. However, when you consider John Riggins' career, Brown's numbers pale in comparison. Riggins played for 14 seasons, split between the New York Jets and the Washington Redskins. During that time, he rushed for a total of 11,352 yards. While this is a bit less than Brown's total, it's important to consider Riggins' remarkable playoff success. In 19 playoff games, he rushed for an additional 2,044 yards, including a record-setting performance in Super Bowl XVII that saw him rack up 166 yards and a touchdown. When you add up Riggins' regular season and playoff totals, his career rushing yards come to 13,394. This total is a full 1,082 yards more than Jim Brown's career total. Riggins' success in the postseason is a big reason for this disparity, but even if you only consider regular season numbers, he still has a slight edge over Brown. In conclusion, when it comes to the question of total yards, John Riggins is the clear winner over Jim Brown. While both were exceptional runners in their own right, Riggins' combination of regular season and playoff success was enough to put him ahead in the overall yardage category."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: (d) to persons of Canadian citizenship who were members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom including the Prime Ministers of Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justices, and some Cabinet Ministers of Canada including the Leader of the Government in the Senate 19211930 and 19351942 the Right Honourable Senator Raoul Dandurand appointed to the United Kingdom Privy Council in 1941; Hypothesis: he was leader in 1923n OPTIONS: Yes It's impossible to say No","output":"It's impossible to say.

This then allows aircraft to take the most direct approach path to the runway and land without worrying about interference from other aircraft. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on prescheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.

Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.

This will induce an additional current in the antenna element, changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory.

Noah Porter, moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simpleminded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply longestablished ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.

The transfer of the prison had been a long-standing demand of the Afghan government, which had criticized the U.S. for holding prisoners without charge. President Karzai thanked America for its support during the handover ceremony. The U.S. has been a major donor to Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, providing billions of dollars in aid and supporting the Afghan security forces.

In a recent sermon, Lord Carey highlighted what he sees as a dangerous trend of the Church trying to follow political fashions, rather than remaining true to its core beliefs. The former Archbishop warned against what he called a \\"dangerous\\" trend of the Church trying to follow political fashions. Lord Carey argued that the Church must remain true to its core beliefs in order to avoid internal ruptures. He also expressed concern about the impact that trends in ministry, marriage, and sexuality are having on the Church. Lord Carey's comments come at a time of significant change and debate within the Church of England. Issues such as same-sex marriage and the ordination of women as bishops have sparked heated debate within the Church, with some traditionalists threatening to break away if the Church moves too far away from traditional teaching. Lord Carey's comments will be seen by many as a warning to the Church to maintain its traditional teachings and not to be swayed by the pressures of modern society. However, his comments will also be viewed by some as an attempt to stifle debate and progress within the Church. The former Archbishop is known for his conservative views, particularly on matters of sexuality and marriage. However, his warnings about the need for the Church to remain united and true to its core beliefs will be welcomed by many within the Church. In conclusion, Lord Carey's sermon highlights the challenges facing the Church of England today. His warning against trying to follow political fashions and his call for the Church to get its house in order will be seen by some as a conservative stance, while others will view it as a reflection of the Church's traditional teachings. Whatever the interpretation, it is clear that the Church of England is facing a time of significant change and debate, and that its future will be shaped by how it responds to these challenges."},{"instruction":"This must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely AfricanAmerican cast.

Following their accession in 1936, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code.

Consuming a balanced diet that is rich in certain nutrients is vital for maintaining healthy hair. Here are six nutrients that can help give your hair the boost it needs. 1. Keratin: Our hair is primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Eating foods that contain keratin helps to strengthen hair and promote growth. Foods like eggs, poultry, fish, and meat are all good sources of keratin. 2. Protein: Eating a protein-rich diet is essential for healthy hair growth because the hair shaft is comprised of protein. Incorporate sources like beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products into your diet. 3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Omega-3s play a crucial role in the health of our skin and hair. Consuming an adequate amount of omega-3s can help prevent dry and brittle hair. Some foods to incorporate into your diet include salmon, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and walnuts. 4. Vitamin C: Our body needs vitamin C to produce collagen, which is important for maintaining healthy hair. Eating foods like citrus fruits, kiwi, strawberries, and peppers can help up your vitamin C intake. 5. Biotin: Biotin is a B vitamin that helps our body produce keratin. Eating foods like eggs, almonds, peanut butter, and sweet potatoes can help increase biotin levels. 6. Cystine: Cystine is an amino acid that helps to strengthen hair and prevent damage. Eating foods that contain cystine such as eggs, poultry, and red peppers can help promote healthy hair growth.

In a statement, Street made clear that unless the government addresses the issue of tax avoidance, companies that use tax havens will be able to \\"out-invest and ultimately out-trade us.\\" The warning comes after high-profile grilling sessions with bosses from Amazon, Google and Starbucks by MPs over their \\"immoral\\" tax avoidance schemes. These companies, along with many others, are using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of UK taxes. The use of tax havens is a controversial issue, with many arguing that it is immoral and unethical. Tax havens provide a way for companies to avoid taxes by moving their profits to low-tax jurisdictions, where they can pay minimal rates of tax. Street's warning highlights the need for action from the government to address this issue. Unless action is taken to close tax loopholes and address tax avoidance, UK businesses will continue to be outperformed by those that use tax havens. The UK government has already taken some steps to address the issue of tax avoidance, with recent changes to the tax laws intended to crack down on this practice. However, more needs to be done to ensure that all companies pay their fair share of UK taxes. In the wake of Street's warning, it is clear that the issue of tax avoidance must be taken seriously.

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment.

Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert.

One of the key elements to developing a believable and engaging character is to craft an interesting backstory. This includes thinking about where your character comes from, their family and upbringing, and any significant events that may have shaped them. Once you have established your character's backstory, it's important to consider who their friends and allies will be. This can include close friends, family members, and even love interests. These relationships can help to bring your character to life and add depth to their personality. No story would be complete without a villain or enemy for the protagonist to overcome. This can range from a traditional antagonist such as a sinister mastermind or evil sorcerer, to a more internal struggle such as addiction or self-doubt. This creates a compelling conflict that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. It's also important to consider where your character fits into the timeline of your story. Are they a new arrival in a strange land, or have they been part of the world for generations? This can help to shape their personality and behavior, as well as provide context for their actions within the larger story. Finally, don't be afraid to get creative and draw or write stories about your finished character. This can help to flesh out their personality and backstory even further, and can also serve as a valuable tool for brainstorming future plot points and character development. Overall, creating a rich and engaging character is a vital part of crafting a captivating story. By considering their backstory, relationships, enemies, place in the timeline, and creating additional content around them, you can bring your character to life in a way that keeps readers invested and eager for more."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

According to Roos, they were entertained by Hamid for the entire flight, while the co-pilots smoked, chatted, and even took photos with the two young women.

The disappearance of MH 370 is one of the most baffling aviation mysteries in history. Despite extensive searches, no wreckage has been found, and no one knows what truly happened to the plane and its 239 passengers and crew members. Roos' claim that she was able to enter the cockpit and spend time with one of the pilots during a flight raises concerns about the security measures in place at the time. It also adds to the speculation that there may have been other breaches in security on board MH 370. It is not yet clear whether Roos' claim has been corroborated or validated by other sources. Malaysian authorities have not yet commented on the matter. The tragedy of MH 370 remains a sobering reminder of the fragility and complexity of air travel, as well as the importance of maintaining robust safety and security protocols to prevent such disasters from occurring in the future.

First, it's important to remove any loose dirt or debris before getting started with the cleaning process. This can be done by shaking out the mats or using a broom or vacuum to get rid of larger particles. Once the loose dirt has been removed, it's time to give the mats a good rinse with the spray attachment of a garden hose. This will help to get rid of any remaining dirt and debris and prepare the mats for the next step. After rinsing, it's time to apply some soapy water and scrub the mats with a brush. Be sure to choose a brush that is gentle enough to avoid damaging the mats, but effective enough to get them clean. A mild soap or detergent can be used to create a soapy solution for cleaning. Focus on scrubbing any particularly dirty or stained areas, making sure to cover the entire surface of the mats. This step may take some time, but it's important to be thorough to ensure that the mats are as clean as possible. Once the mats have been scrubbed and cleaned, it's time to rinse them off once again. This will help to remove any remaining soap or detergent, which can leave a residue if not properly removed. After rinsing, be sure to dry the mats thoroughly using a microfiber towel. This type of towel is perfect for drying mats because it is absorbent and soft, which means that it won't scratch or damage the mats as they are being dried. By following these basic steps, anyone can successfully clean their mats and keep them looking great for years to come. Whether you have doormats, floor mats or car mats, regular cleaning is key to keeping them in good condition and ensuring that they continue to serve their purpose effectively.

Your core muscles, which include your abdominals, hips, and lower back, are responsible for supporting your spine and pelvis, maintaining good posture, and generating the power and stability needed for many everyday activities and sports. One effective way to build core strength is through targeted exercises. Here are five exercises you can incorporate into your fitness routine: 1. Plank - The plank is a classic core exercise that targets your abs, back, and shoulders. To perform a plank, start in a push-up position and lower yourself onto your forearms. Hold your body in a straight line for as long as you can, keeping your core engaged and your hips lifted. 2. Side plank - The side plank is a variation on the plank that specifically targets your obliques, the muscles on the sides of your abs. To perform a side plank, lie on your side with your forearm on the floor and your feet stacked on top of each other. Lift your hips off the ground and hold for as long as you can. 3. Leg lifts - Leg lifts are an effective exercise for targeting your lower abs. To perform leg lifts, lie on your back with your legs straight and lift them up to a 45-degree angle. Keep your core engaged and lower your legs back down, without touching the floor, and repeat. 4. Side leg lifts - Side leg lifts are a variation on leg lifts that target your outer thighs and hips. To perform side leg lifts, lie on your side with your legs straight and lift your top leg up to a 45-degree angle. Keep your core engaged and lower your leg back down, without touching the floor, and repeat. 5.

Incorporating kettlebell training into your routine can help improve your overall core strength and stability.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received a complaint about the advertising campaign, which starred the footballer prominently and emphasized the drink's use of \\"fine French hops.\\" The complaint argued that the adverts misleadingly suggested the hops were a key ingredient in the drink. However, the ASA investigation found that the hops in question were only used in small quantities and did not contribute significantly to the flavour of the drink. The ASA ruled that the adverts were in breach of the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) code, which states that advertisements must not mislead consumers about the characteristics, ingredients, and efficacy of the advertised product. This ruling highlights the importance of transparency in advertising, ensuring that consumers are not misled into believing that ingredients or characteristics of a product are more significant than they actually are. It also shows the role that the ASA plays in investigating complaints and enforcing the codes of conduct for advertising in the UK. In response to the ruling, the brew company stated that they would ensure that their advertising is \\"clear and transparent\\" going forward. The footballer has not yet commented on the issue. Overall, the ruling serves as a reminder to advertisers to be mindful of their claims and to ensure that they accurately reflect the product they are promoting.

Fiftyfour percent of nonwhites say Wilson should be charged with murder, while 23% of whites hold that view. The poll is out Monday and is from CNN/ORC international.","output":"A recent poll conducted by CNN/ORC international has found that there is a significant division between whites and non-whites when it comes to the issue of whether or not former police officer Darren Wilson should face murder charges. The poll, which was released on Monday, revealed that 54% of non-whites believe that Wilson should be charged with murder, while only 23% of whites hold the same view. This divide in opinion highlights the ongoing issue of racial tensions in America, particularly in relation to cases of police brutality and unjustified use of force against people of color. It is clear that there is a stark difference in how non-whites and whites view incidents where police officers are involved. While non-whites are more likely to believe that police officers should be held accountable for any unjust use of force, whites seem to be less likely to support such action. The case of Darren Wilson, who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, has garnered national attention and sparked protests and demonstrations across the country. While Wilson was not charged with murder, the incident has become a symbol of the systemic racism and bias that exists within law enforcement. The findings of this poll suggest that there is much work to be done in terms of creating a more equitable and just society, where everyone is treated fairly and without prejudice.

The study focused on the cognitive abilities of the wealthiest individuals in the world and analyzed their performance in various tasks that required critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. The findings of the study are significant as they shed light on the contribution of cognitive abilities in attaining financial success. The study also challenges the notion that wealth accumulation is solely driven by factors such as luck, privilege, or inheritance. The study's lead author, Jonathan Wai, says that the results provide a valuable insight into the skills and abilities that are required for achieving financial success. Wai also adds that cognitive abilities play a crucial role in other areas of life and are essential for social mobility, job success, and academic performance. The study also found that most billionaires had an average IQ of 130, which is significantly higher than the average IQ of the general population. Furthermore, the study found that billionaires had a higher likelihood of being in the top one percent for other traits, such as creativity and openness to experience. However, the study does not offer a definitive explanation for why cognitive ability is related to wealth accumulation. It is possible that individuals with high cognitive ability are better equipped to identify opportunities and make decisions that result in greater financial success. Alternatively, they may be more adept at navigating complex financial systems and making profitable investments. Overall, the study highlights the importance of cognitive abilities in achieving financial success, and offers valuable insights into the skills and abilities required for success in other areas of life.

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

An antiterrorism strategy without diplomacy is a shortterm fix, President says. Obama presented a lawyerly defense of his foreign policy to date.","output":"US Officials Question Yemen Military; President Rejects Short-Term Fixes The United States officials are deliberating the Yemeni military's ability to secure its territory amid growing threats from terrorist organizations – a task that is complicated by the country's civil war. Although the US has traditionally relied on Yemen as an ally in the fight against terrorism, the instability plaguing the country has left questions surrounding its ability to effectively combat the threat. “This is a country that has been going through a civil war now for several years, and it will take time for them to build up the capacity … to secure their own borders and their own territory,” said US Defense Secretary James Mattis. Despite the concerns surrounding Yemen's capability, President Obama warned against short-term strategies and argued the importance of diplomacy in any anti-terrorism efforts. The president defended his foreign policy, maintaining that a focus on diplomacy, in addition to military action, is essential in fighting terrorism in the long-term. “The notion that the answer to terrorism is to go ahead and deploy a larger military footprint, even if it may be temporarily effective, as an anti-terrorism strategy, is a mistake,” Obama said during a speech at the Pentagon. Instead, he urged the need for successful efforts in building international alliances and encouraging diplomatic solutions in order to focus on long-term solutions. Obama's defense of his foreign policy was described by many as \\"lawyerly,\\" as the President methodically laid out the longstanding challenges to U.S. national security, such as the war in Syria and the fight against ISIS. While emphasizing the importance of diplomatic and political solutions in resolving these issues, the President also stressed the need to stay vigilant with military tools to combat extremist threats. In the end, Obama’s message was clear: Diplomacy must be an essential component of the long-term strategy against terrorism. While acknowledging that there are no easy solutions to the global threat of terrorism faced by the United States, the President made a compelling case for a balance between military might and diplomatic finesse, in addition to maintaining an unwavering commitment to effectively thwarting terrorism in all its forms."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","output":"\\"The movie was an absolute delight!

How Morgan Freeman's unnamed character psychically (not physically)arrives to where he meets this jaded checkout girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter two people on opposite sides of the coin of society is deceptively simple.
