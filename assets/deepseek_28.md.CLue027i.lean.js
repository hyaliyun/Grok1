For his rushing touchdowns, Addai had a total of 2,153 rushing yards in his career. Dividing this total by his 29 rushing touchdowns gives an average of 74.31 yards per rushing touchdown. For his receiving touchdowns, Addai had a total of 1,448 receiving yards in his career. Dividing this total by his 10 receiving touchdowns gives an average of 144.8 yards per receiving touchdown.

There is some debate as to whether roasts with large marbling were particularly tasty late in the roasting process (e.g.. 1sketed beef the better cut you're going for). Look for cuts of beef that come from the rib, short loin or sirloin section of the steer. These parts of the animal are found between the front and hind legs along the top portion of the animal. Making a note of the cut and marbling in advance of roasting will let you steer a more accurate and timely input into these details later.

They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848‚Äì1925) and Bertrand Russell (1872‚Äì1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the socalled verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.

The show had its fair share of problems, including an early flying mishap for Williams while Walken was accused of bad lip syncing. Last year, the show was also slammed by many who called Underwood's acting 'amatuer' and panned other actors' singing.","output":"On Thursday night, NBC aired its second live musical production, Peter Pan Live, and the numbers are in: 9.1 million viewers tuned in to watch the beloved story of Peter Pan come to life on their screens. While this is certainly a respectable number, it pales in comparison to the viewership of last year's broadcast of The Sound of Music, which drew a whopping 18.6 million viewers. Despite the lower turnout, Peter Pan Live still had plenty to offer viewers. Allison Williams, best known for her role in Girls, starred as the titular character, and Christopher Walken took on the role of Captain Hook. The production was sleek and visually stunning, with elaborate sets and costumes that brought Neverland to life. Of course, no live production is without its hiccups, and Peter Pan Live was no exception. Williams suffered an early flying mishap during the opening number, but managed to laugh it off and carry on with the show. Walken, on the other hand, was criticized by some for his supposed bad lip syncing during several musical numbers. This isn't the first time NBC's live musicals have been met with mixed reviews. Last year's production of The Sound of Music, which starred country singer Carrie Underwood, was slammed by many for its amateurish acting and weak vocal performances from some of the other cast members. Despite these criticisms, NBC seems committed to making live musical productions a holiday tradition.

The first step is to turn off the power at the circuit breaker to ensure that there is no electricity flowing through the wires. Once you have done this, you can proceed to remove the light bulbs.

Once the screws are removed, you can gently pull the fixture away from the ceiling or wall. At this point, you will be able to access the switch that needs to be replaced. Before you remove the switch, you need to unscrew the nut that is located on the side of the fixture that holds the switch. This will allow you to pull out the switch and inspect the chain more closely. Check for any signs of wear or damage that may be causing the switch to malfunction. If you notice any damage to the switch, it is important to replace it as soon as possible. You can purchase a replacement switch from your local hardware store or online. Make sure that you choose a switch that is compatible with your light fixture and wiring. Once you have your new switch, it is a simple matter of connecting the wires and screwing it back into place. Make sure that you follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and double-check all of your connections to ensure that they are secure.

Attend events where you can learn about observational learning. Enroll in relevant degree or nondegree granting programs that focus on related problems.","output":"Observational learning, also known as social learning, is a powerful tool for acquiring new knowledge and skills by observing others. This process involves watching others perform particular tasks, and then attempting to replicate that behavior in our own lives. There are different approaches toward observational learning that can help individuals to better understand and master this skill. One approach to observational learning is to watch experts in action. This could involve attending events where individuals can observe professionals in a particular field performing their duties. For example, aspiring chefs could attend cooking classes where they can observe experienced chefs prepare meals. Similarly, aspiring musicians may attend concerts to watch accomplished musicians perform. By watching experts, individuals can gain insights into how professionals approach different tasks and learn from their strategies. Another approach is to learn from peers. Observational learning doesn't necessarily have to come from experts or professionals. Learning from peers who have experienced similar challenges can also be an effective approach. For instance, individuals who are learning a new language can benefit from finding a conversation partner who already speaks that language fluently. They can then observe and learn from their partner's language use, and attempt to replicate their methods. Finally, enrolling in relevant degree or non-degree granting programs can provide individuals with a structured approach to learning about observational learning. Such programs could include courses in psychology, education, and social sciences that focus on how individuals learn through observation. These programs can provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of observation methods and how to effectively apply them in various contexts. In conclusion, observation learning can be a powerful tool for personal and professional growth. Different approaches toward observational learning including observing experts, learning from peers, and enrolling in degree or non-degree programs can enhance our observational learning skills. Therefore, individuals should aim to apply these approaches in their lives so that they can acquire new knowledge and skills by observing others."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Englandsfarere (English: We Leave for England ) is a 1946 Norwegian war film directed by Toralf Sand√∏, starring Knut Wigert and J√∏rn Ording.

The answer to this question is a matter of debate, as there are several quarterbacks who have thrown impressive long touchdown passes throughout the history of the NFL. According to the official NFL record books, the longest touchdown pass in NFL history was thrown by a Chicago Bears quarterback named Ed Brown in 1951. Brown's pass traveled an incredible distance of 99 yards and was caught by his teammate Bill Wightkin for a touchdown. However, some football fans and experts argue that there have been longer touchdown passes thrown in exhibition games, college football, or other non-NFL leagues. In fact, some sports historians have documented touchdown passes that traveled over 100 yards! However, these records are not officially recognized by the NFL or its governing body. Other notable long touchdown passes in NFL history include a 98-yard pass by Tom Brady to Wesley Welker, a 97-yard pass by Brett Favre to Robert Brooks, and a 96-yard pass by Eli Manning to Victor Cruz. These plays all required incredible arm strength, accuracy, and timing from the quarterbacks involved. Despite the impressive feats of these quarterbacks, it's worth noting that a long touchdown pass is always a team effort. The quarterback needs to have time to throw the ball, the receiver needs to run the right route and make the catch, and the offensive line needs to block effectively. Without each of these important elements working in concert, a long touchdown pass can be difficult if not impossible to achieve. In conclusion, the answer to the question of who threw the longest touchdown pass in history is somewhat subjective. Officially, the record belongs to Ed Brown of the Chicago Bears. However, there have been other impressive long touchdown passes throughout NFL history, each of which required incredible skill and teamwork from the players involved."},{"instruction":"feels like forever since I ' ve posted here .

The first step is to choose a grout stain that complements your tile color and style. There are many different options available, including classic shades like white and gray or more modern colors like blue or green. Be sure to choose a stain that is appropriate for your specific type of grout. Once you have your stain, the next step is to thoroughly clean your tile and grout. This is important to remove any dirt, grime, or debris that could interfere with the stain adhering properly. You can use a commercial tile and grout cleaner or make your own with a mixture of vinegar and baking soda. After cleaning, allow the grout to dry completely before applying the stain. Follow the instructions on the stain package, which will typically include using a small brush or applicator to spread the stain over the grout lines. Be careful not to get any stain on the tile itself, as it can be difficult to remove. Depending on the color and coverage you want to achieve, you may need to add additional coats of stain. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Finally, once you are satisfied with the color and coverage of your grout stain, it is important to seal the grout to protect it from future staining or damage. There are many different grout sealers available, including spray-on or brush-on options. You can also choose between a natural or glossy finish. By following these simple steps, you can easily stain and seal your grout to give your tile floors a beautiful new look that will last for years to come."},{"instruction":"This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close.

However, maintaining the quality and lifespan of a wig can be a challenge, particularly when it comes to detangling. Thankfully, with the right tools and a few tips, you can easily detangle your wig and keep it looking its best. To begin, place the wig on a head or mannequin to keep it in place while you work. Next, start detangling the ends of the wig with your fingers and a wide-tooth comb, working your way up towards the roots. This helps to prevent any unnecessary pulling or damaging of the wig fibers. For added help, consider using a detangling product such as a spray or lotion to assist in the process. Simply spray or apply the lotion to the wig and gently comb through the strands. This will help to further loosen any knots or tangles, making it easier to comb through. If you don't have a detangling product on hand, you can also use a diluted fabric softener to help soften and loosen the fibers. Combine one part fabric softener with three parts water in a spray bottle and mist over the wig. Let it sit for a few minutes before gently combing through the strands. Remember, when detangling your wig, it's important to be gentle and patient. Avoid harsh pulling or tugging that could damage the fibers and always work slowly and methodically.

Be honest and straightforward about your feelings and give the other person the respect they deserve. Stress is a common factor in many breakups. It‚Äôs important to recognize the ways that stress can impact your actions and emotions during this time. Practice self-care and find ways to manage your stress, such as exercise or talking to a trusted friend or therapist. This will help you approach the breakup with a clear and level head.

Closure can take many forms, such as having a final conversation or simply taking time for yourself to reflect and heal.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Cash machine thefts have become a growing problem in the UK, with a tripling of incidents reported in the past year alone. The police have identified that 90% of these thefts are linked to Romanian immigrants. The rise in these thefts has also led to an increase in the cost of card fraud, which is expected to reach ¬£400 million by the end of the year. In the first four months of 2013, there were 7,572 reported cash machine card thefts, compared to only 2,553 in the same period last year. This indicates a worrying trend of increasing thefts, which is set to continue unless action is taken. Many experts believe that the increase in cash machine thefts is due to the ease with which criminals can access cash and card information. This is compounded by the fact that many card users do not take sufficient precautions when using cash machines, making it easy for fraudsters to steal their information. The police have identified that a large proportion of these thefts are carried out by Romanian immigrants, highlighting the need for tighter controls on the movement of people and greater cooperation between national law enforcement agencies. The rise in cash machine thefts is not only damaging to those individuals affected, but is also having a wider economic impact, with the estimated cost of fraud set to reach ¬£400 million by the end of the year. This underscores the need for individuals and businesses alike to take measures to protect themselves from card fraud and other forms of financial crime. In conclusion, the rise in cash machine thefts is a concerning trend which requires a collaborative effort from law enforcement agencies, financial institutions and individual cardholders to combat. Enhanced security measures, tighter controls on movement, and greater public awareness are all necessary steps to prevent further losses and ensure the security of our financial systems."},{"instruction":"Sentence: They want to leave the meeting.

To ensure that both you and your pet are living in a clean and healthy environment, it's important to establish a regular cleaning routine. The first step in establishing a cleaning routine is to clean up pet messes immediately. Whether it's a spill or an accident, it's crucial to get rid of the mess as soon as possible. This will not only prevent stains and odors from setting in but will also prevent the spread of bacteria and germs. Another important aspect of pet care is washing toys, bedding, and accessories regularly. These items can quickly accumulate dirt, hair, and bacteria, which can be harmful to you and your pet. By washing them at least once a week, you can keep them smelling fresh and clean. Keeping your pet well-groomed is another important part of pet care. Regular brushing, bathing, and trimming can help keep your pet's fur and skin healthy and clean. This will also help prevent mats and tangles from forming, which can be uncomfortable for your pet. Wiping your pet's paws before they come inside is also a simple yet effective way to keep your home clean. This will prevent dirt, mud, and other debris from being tracked inside, which can wreak havoc on your floors and carpets. Putting a washable cover on your furniture is another great way to keep your home clean. This will protect your furniture from pet hair, scratches, and accidents, while also providing a comfortable place for your pet to relax. Lastly, keeping the litter box clean is crucial for both your pet's health and your home's cleanliness. Regularly scooping out waste and replacing litter can help prevent odor and bacteria buildup. In conclusion, establishing a regular cleaning routine is essential for every pet owner. By cleaning up messes immediately, washing toys and bedding regularly, keeping your pet well-groomed, wiping paws before they come inside, putting a washable cover on furniture, and keeping the litter box clean, you can create a clean and healthy environment for both you and your pet."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? sndag den 23 november 2014","output":"Sunday, November 23, 2014."},{"instruction":"Keywords: mushroom, olive, onion, pizza What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","output":"I would like a pizza with mushrooms, olives, and onions as toppings."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Inpremiseswhere,forvariousreasons,anoverallceilingcannotbeused,e.g.wheretemperatureisregulatedviathejoists(concretecoreactivation)orwheretherearelargeareasofglass,absorbentraftsareonewayofcreatingacceptableacousticenvironments.Theabsorbentacousticraftscanbedesignedasbafflesorhorizontallysuspendedunits.","output":"Absorbent rafts are a solution in premises where an overall ceiling cannot be used, such as where temperature is regulated via the joists (concrete core activation) or where there are large areas of glass, for creating acceptable acoustic environments.

Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming handpicked for sports.

Additionally, when presenting a solution, it‚Äôs important to consider how it will affect the company. Will it improve productivity or revenue? Will it save time and resources? Emphasizing the positive benefits of the solution can help get buy-in from managers and colleagues. However, simply highlighting the good points isn‚Äôt always enough. Confirming actions before taking them can help prevent any misunderstandings or miscommunication. Making sure everyone is on the same page can also help ensure that the solution is successfully implemented. It‚Äôs also important to document how the solution will be followed up on. Will there be check-ins to see how the solution is working? Will there be a report on how the solution has affected the company? Documenting these steps can help measure the success of the solution and can also be useful in solving similar problems in the future. In conclusion, when presenting a solution to a problem at work, it‚Äôs important to have a plan, consider the impact on the company, emphasize the good points, confirm actions, and document how the solution will be followed up on. By following these steps, solutions can be implemented more successfully, leading to a more efficient and productive workplace."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = less than ¬£20, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes, near = Burger King.

A recent survey conducted in Australia found that a staggering 85 percent of gay people have either experienced or witnessed homophobia while playing sports, or as spectators. The survey, which was completed by 2,500 Australians, also found that half of those surveyed had been the target of homophobic slurs, verbal threats, ongoing bullying, or exclusion from social groups. The experiences of Brennan Bastyovanszky, who was subjected to homophobic slurs when he joined a Sydney rugby team a decade ago, are unfortunately all too common. So ostracized was he that he didn't play rugby for four years. This kind of negativity and exclusion can have a deeply damaging impact on athletes and their sense of self-worth. The issue of homophobia in sports is a serious one and requires urgent attention. Sports organizations and governing bodies need to work together to create inclusive environments where everyone feels safe and welcome, regardless of their sexuality. This may involve implementing policies to punish players who engage in homophobic behavior, providing diversity training to coaches and officials, and working closely with LGBT+ advocacy groups to raise awareness and promote inclusivity. Ultimately, we need to recognize that sports should be a space for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By taking action to address homophobia in sports, we can help ensure that athletes like Bastyovanszky are never again made to feel like outsiders in the world of sports. It is time for all of us to step up and make sports a truly inclusive space, where everyone can feel safe and welcome to participate."},{"instruction":"ere is a premise: and then i like the they have a new one now the Star Trek the Next Generation which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and Here is a hypothesis: I think fans of the old Star Trek series will enjoy the new movie.

She revealed that when she was first rescued, she actually thought that the rescuers were burglars who had broken into the house. Her experience had conditioned her to expect the worst, and so she was hesitant to believe that help had finally arrived. Knight went on to share that her initial reaction was to plead with the police not to let her go, as she had been so conditioned to rely on her captor, Ariel Castro. Despite the crime and torture that he had inflicted upon her, Knight still felt a sense of attachment and dependence on Castro - a common experience among Stockholm syndrome victims. When asked about Castro's suicide in prison, Knight revealed that she didn't feel any ill will towards him. Rather, she felt sadness that he didn't have the opportunity to receive the help he so clearly needed. She pointed out that, while she was able to survive and heal from her trauma, Castro never received the support or therapy he needed to overcome his twisted desires and violent tendencies. Overall, Knight expressed that the past year had been \\"overwhelming but amazing as hell.\\" While she acknowledges the ongoing struggle of healing from such a traumatic experience, she also feels immense gratitude for being given a second chance at life. She has focused on writing, advocating for victims of abuse, and cherishing the relationships she has with her loved ones.

The 1990s brought a brief period of budget surpluses, but the debt began to climb again in the late 1990s due to various factors, including increased spending on entitlements and defense, as well as tax cuts. By the end of 2000, the national debt had risen to 5.7 trillion. The early 2000s saw a continuation of tax cuts and increased spending on military operations overseas, resulting in an even higher national debt. By 2008, the debt had reached 10.6 trillion. The Great Recession of 2008 brought about a period of economic slowdown and reduced tax revenues, leading to an even greater increase in the national debt. By the end of 2019, the national debt had surpassed 23 trillion. In summary, it took approximately 12 years for the public debt to increase from 712 billion to 2.052 trillion. However, a variety of economic and political factors have contributed to significant increases in the public debt over the past several decades."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Locate the gear app icon on the homescreen or app drawer, and tap it.

Apply a gentle scrub. Rinse your face with water and pat dry.","output":"Keeping your face clean is essential to maintain healthy and radiant skin. The accumulation of dirt, oil, and residue from cosmetics and environmental pollutants can clog pores and lead to breakouts, dullness, and premature aging. A simple skincare routine can help you remove impurities and exfoliate dead skin cells that can interfere with your complexion's natural glow. The first step in any skincare routine is to cleanse your face. Use a gentle cleanser that is suitable for your skin type and make sure to remove any makeup or sunscreen before washing your face. Gently massage the cleanser onto your face in circular motions, paying close attention to your T-zone and areas prone to acne. Rinse with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel. Once you have a clean canvas, it's time to exfoliate. A gentle scrub can help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, leaving your skin smoother and brighter. Choose a scrub with fine particles that won't irritate your skin or cause micro-tears. Apply a small amount of the scrub onto your fingertips and gently massage onto your face in a circular motion. Rinse with water and pat dry. After exfoliating, it's essential to restore the natural moisture balance of your skin. Apply a lightweight moisturizer that is suitable for your skin type to nourish and hydrate your skin. Gently massage the moisturizer onto your face, neck, and decolletage to provide a protective barrier against environmental stressors. Remember to repeat this routine every day, preferably before bedtime, to keep your skin healthy and radiant. Regular cleansing and exfoliating will remove impurities, promote collagen production, and improve cell turnover, thereby reducing the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines. In conclusion, cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing are essential steps to ensure healthy, radiant skin. Follow this simple skincare routine every day to remove impurities, unclog pores, and restore your skin's natural glow. With time and patience, you'll achieve a youthful, even complexion that radiates beauty from within."},{"instruction":"Generate a negative review for a place.","output":"The place was a complete disappointment.

One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrelcage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its preWorld War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not selfstarting.

Putting is one of the most important aspects of golf, as it is the shot that finishes off a hole. To improve putting skills, players should practice with soft hands. Soft hands help to control the speed and direction of the ball. Another area that players can work on is chipping. When chipping, players should also use soft hands to help control the ball. Using soft hands can also help to prevent the ball from rolling too far past the hole. Additionally, players should pay attention to the lie of the golf ball. The lie of the ball can affect how the ball bounces and rolls, so it's important to take it into account when chipping. Finally, when pitching, players should use their arms to control the shot. Pitching with the arms helps to generate more power and accuracy in the shot. Additionally, players should also pay attention to the lie of the ball when pitching. By checking the lie of the ball, players can adjust their shot and make sure that it lands where they want it to. In conclusion, improving golf skills requires a combination of practice, patience, and attention to detail. By working on putting, chipping, and pitching skills, players can help to improve their overall game. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced golfer, these tips can help you improve your skills and make your time on the course more enjoyable."},{"instruction":"Data: name = The Golden Curry, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = moderate, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers.
