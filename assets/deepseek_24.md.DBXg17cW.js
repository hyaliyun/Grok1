Some madaris further extended their curriculum to history, politics, ethics, music, metaphysics, medicine, astronomy and chemistry.

Her survival is being attributed to her quick thinking and self-defense skills. Her technique of striking the shark in the snout is a known tactic to scare off the predator, and it seems to have worked for her. Another surfer, Scott Stephens, also survived a shark attack by punching the animal in California. His quick reactions and willingness to fight back allowed him to escape the attack and live to tell the tale. Both incidents demonstrate that punching a shark can be an effective strategy to scare it away. These incidents come at a time when shark attacks are becoming more frequent around the world. While there is no foolproof way to protect oneself against a shark attack, these examples show that learning self-defense techniques and maintaining a clear head in an emergency can save lives.

Post foreboding signs: Install signs or decals around your property informing potential intruders that your home is secured. The warning will make them think twice about entering your home. 6. Don‚Äôt show off expensive stuff: Avoid leaving expensive items outside or in plain sight from the street. Thieves are attracted by the sight of valuable items. 7. Be careful when having workers in your home: Always use reputable contractors or workers and never let strangers into your home without proper identification. 8. Make your valuables hard to access: Keep your most valuable items in a safe or lockbox to prevent them from being easily accessible. 9. Engrave and register valuables: Lastly, engrave your valuable items to make them easier to identify and register them with the police department. This will help get them back to you in case of theft. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your home is safe and secure, giving you peace of mind, whether you‚Äôre at home or away."},{"instruction":"ere is some data: The Vaults food Italian; The Vaults priceRange cheap.

To ensure your message is received as intended, there are several key steps you can take to establish focus and clarity. Firstly, it is crucial to get the other person's attention before attempting to talk or communicate. This not only ensures they are fully present and engaged but also demonstrates respect for their time and willingness to listen. Once you have established their attention, it is helpful to establish the gist of what you are going to talk about. This can be as simple as stating the purpose of the conversation or summarizing the primary points you will be discussing. By outlining the main focus of the conversation at the outset, you can help keep the discussion on track and minimize confusion or misunderstanding. Inevitably, interruptions may occur during the conversation. It is important to acknowledge and address these interruptions as soon as possible, without allowing them to derail the conversation entirely. One approach is to kindly ask for a moment to finish your thought before addressing the interruption. This demonstrates respect for both parties while ensuring your message is received in its entirety. When communicating with someone who is using an interpreter, it is essential to speak directly to the person, not the interpreter. While the interpreter serves as a bridge between the two parties, the conversation must remain focused on the individual being spoken to. By communicating directly, you can ensure that the intended message is received and that any cultural nuances or specific details are accurately conveyed. Finally, you can offer to summarize the conversation to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This not only helps to reinforce the key points discussed but also provides an opportunity to clarify any points of confusion or misunderstanding. By following these key steps to establish focus and clarity in your communication, you can help ensure that your message is received as intended and that your conversations are productive and effective."},{"instruction":"Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist?

Approximately 1 million people in the United States have Parkinson's.","output":"Parkinson's Disease: Understanding a Progressive Disorder of the Nervous System Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. The disorder is characterized by the death of neurons that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for the coordination and control of movements. As the neurons die, the brain is left with a deficit of dopamine, causing a range of physical and cognitive symptoms. These symptoms include tremors, stiffness, slowed movements, difficulty with balance, and speech problems. As the disease progresses, the symptoms typically worsen and can interfere with daily activities. Currently, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms. Medications, such as levodopa, can help increase dopamine levels in the brain and improve mobility. Patients may also undergo physical therapy or occupational therapy, which can help improve strength, flexibility, and balance. It is estimated that approximately 1 million people in the United States have Parkinson's disease, and the disease affects men and women of all ethnicities and ages. While the exact cause of the disease is unknown, research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to its development. Despite the challenges associated with Parkinson's disease, many people are able to maintain a high quality of life with proper treatment and support. It is important for patients with Parkinson's disease to work closely with their healthcare providers and receive ongoing care to manage the symptoms of the disease.

However, keepers have advised that it would not be safe to pair him up with a new mate due to his advanced age. Zoo staff have put up a sign explaining the sad story of Toto for concerned visitors. Toto's story is a poignant reminder of the social and emotional complexities of chimpanzees. These highly intelligent primates form strong bonds with their companions and thrive on social interaction with their peers. Therefore, living alone can be an isolating and stressful experience for them. However, in Toto's case, the experts at Drayton Manor Zoo have made the difficult decision not to introduce him to a new partner. As chimpanzees age, they become less tolerant and more territorial, which can lead to aggression and fighting. Therefore, introducing a new chimp into Toto's enclosure could place both animals at risk. Instead, Toto is receiving excellent care from his dedicated keepers, who provide him with a stimulating and enriching environment. They offer him plenty of opportunities to play, explore, and interact with his human caregivers, which helps to keep him mentally and physically active. Visitors to Drayton Manor Zoo can learn about Toto's story and the challenges that aging chimpanzees face. The sign posted by zoo staff is a reminder that, while zoos play an essential role in preserving endangered species, they also have a responsibility to care for the individual needs of each animal under their care. In conclusion, Toto's story highlights the importance of understanding and responding to the social and emotional needs of chimpanzees. While it may be tempting to pair up animals for their mutual benefit, it is essential to consider the risks involved, particularly for elderly animals like Toto. Drayton Manor Zoo has done an excellent job of caring for Toto and ensuring that he receives the best possible care despite living alone."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: through about 90 minutes of a socalled \` comedy ' and not laugh Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?

The decision comes as a state board voted to deny clemency to Hill just hours before his execution was set to take place. The actions mark the latest developments in a case that has been controversial since Hill's original sentencing. Hill was sentenced to death in 1991 for the murder of his girlfriend, Myra Wright, while he was serving a life sentence for killing a fellow inmate in 1986. Hill's legal team has argued for years that Hill is intellectually disabled, which would make his execution unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedent. Despite numerous appeals and stays of execution, Hill's case has continued to move forward. Most recently, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 3-0 to deny clemency to Hill, stating that \\"there is no doubt that Hill is not intellectually disabled.\\" This decision came just hours before his scheduled execution. Hill's case has become a rallying point for opponents of the death penalty and advocates for the intellectually disabled. His legal team has been fighting for years to have his sentence commuted to life without parole, arguing that Hill's intellectual disabilities make him less culpable for his crimes. Despite those efforts, Hill's execution date drew near. The Supreme Court had previously granted several stays of execution, but ultimately declined to step in and grant another stay. The state of Georgia carried out Hill's execution as scheduled. The case highlights the ongoing debate over the use of the death penalty in cases where defendants may have intellectual disabilities.

When asked about his style, Tarantino had this to say: \\"I'm trying to get you to laugh at things you've never laughed at before.\\" His films often push the boundaries of mainstream cinema, with unconventional humor, graphic violence, and unconventional twists. Tarantino has been criticized by some for his use of violence and provocative themes, but his die-hard fans argue that his films are intended to shock audiences out of their complacency. They are a reflection of the dark underbelly of society and the human psyche, not meant to be taken at face value. Whether you love or hate his movies, there is no denying that Tarantino is a true iconoclast of modern cinema. His films challenge us to look beyond the surface and see the world in a new light, and for that, we should be grateful."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: The sun sets at eight and we dont get to the seafront in time when we finally find a bar with sea view and two ouzos The Lord has pulled the curtain and sea and sky have merged in blackne","output":"\\"The sun sets at eight, and we don't get to the seafront in time.

Rowling, who stands at 5ft 4in, is often pictured in towering heels at red carpet events. However, she revealed that she still has trusty flat boots for walking with her pets. This love affair with shoes is not a new phenomenon. For decades, people across the globe have placed great value on their footwear choices. From the classic Chanel pump to the Nike Air Jordans, shoes have been a way for people to make a statement about their personality, status, and even political views. In fact, some studies have shown that shoes can have a psychological impact on both the wearer and the viewer. Shoes can make a person feel more confident and empowered, while also being a symbol of social status and sex appeal. But what is it about shoes that captivate us so much? For some, it may be the way they complete an outfit, while for others it may be the comfort and practicality they provide. However, there's no denying the allure of a beautifully crafted pair of shoes. As Rowling stated, shoes hold a certain power and fascination over many of us. Whether it's a pair of sky-high stilettos or comfortable walking boots, our shoe choices can say a lot about who we are as individuals.

This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.

If you have blonde, silver, or platinum hair, you may want to consider using purple shampoo to keep your hair color looking fresh and vibrant. However, not all purple shampoos are created equal, and it's essential to choose one that's appropriate for your hair color and type. Here are some tips on how to choose the right purple shampoo for your hair: 1. Find a thick, pigmented purple shampoo When shopping for purple shampoo, look for one that has a thick color and consistency. This is because the darker, more pigmented the formula, the better it will be at toning down unwanted yellow or brassy tones in your hair. 2. Buy a darker purple shampoo for grey, silver, or platinum hair If you have grey, silver, or platinum hair, you'll want to choose a purple shampoo that's darker in color. This is because these hair colors are more susceptible to yellowing, and a darker purple shampoo will help tone down the yellow tones effectively. 3. Pick a brighter purple shampoo if you have blonde hair If you have blonde hair, you may want to choose a brighter purple shampoo. This is because the lighter formula will still help to neutralize any yellow tones in your hair. However, it won't be as effective as a darker purple shampoo would be for darker hair colors. 4. Avoid purple shampoo if you have dark hair If you have dark hair, it's best to avoid using purple shampoo altogether. This is because the purple pigment can actually darken your hair further, making it look dull and lifeless. Instead, opt for a shampoo that's specifically designed for your hair color and type. In conclusion, using purple shampoo can be an excellent way to maintain the vibrancy of your colored hair. However, it's important to choose the right formula based on your hair color and type. By following these tips, you'll be able to find the perfect purple shampoo for your hair and keep it looking beautiful and healthy."},{"instruction":"Write a title: Filter Corporate Email Through GmailShawn Hogan from DigitalPoint actually started filtering his various corporate email accounts through the gmail mail server.

Set the blade. Load your tomato. Cut your tomato. Enjoy!","output":"If you're looking for a quick and efficient way to slice tomatoes, a mandoline is an excellent tool to have in your kitchen. With just a few simple steps, you can set up your mandoline and start cutting perfect tomato slices in no time. First, make sure your mandoline is set up properly. Most mandolines come with various interchangeable blades, so you'll want to choose the one that's best for slicing tomatoes. Once you've selected your blade, attach it securely to the mandoline according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, adjust the blade so that it's at the desired thickness for your tomato slices. Keep in mind that thinner slices will be more delicate and easier to chew, while thicker slices will hold up better in sandwiches or salads. Once you've set your blade to the desired thickness, lock it into place so it stays put while you slice. Now it's time to load up your tomato. Choose a ripe tomato with a sturdy skin, and wash it thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. Cut off the stem end and use a sharp knife to make a very shallow slit or \\"X\\" on the bottom of the tomato. This will help it sit securely on the mandoline without wobbling. Once your tomato is loaded up, carefully slide it back and forth over the blade, using a smooth and steady motion. Keep your fingers away from the blade, and use the hand guard that comes with most mandolines to help keep your hands safe. Depending on the size of your tomato and the thickness of your slices, you may need to stop and readjust the blade a few times. Once you've sliced all the way through your tomato, you should have a perfectly even stack of precise slices. Transfer them to a plate or cutting board, and admire your handiwork. Whether you're making a Caprese salad, a sandwich, or just snacking on fresh tomato slices, your mandoline will help you cut them quickly and easily. So go ahead, load up another tomato and keep on slicing ‚Äì the possibilities are endless!"},{"instruction":"NordiskFilmA/SNordiskFilmistheleadingproduceranddistributoroffilmsintheNordiccountriesandoperatesthebiggestcinemachainsinDenmarkandNorway.NordiskFilmhasdigitalbusinesseswithingiftcards,ticketingservicesandcomputergamesdevelopmentandisthedistributorofPlayStationintheNordicandBalticcountries.

These are the foundations of trust and respect, the building blocks of love and compassion, and the pillars of a strong and lasting relationship. Taking responsibility means acknowledging your own part in the relationship‚Äôs success or failure. It means owning up to your mistakes, taking charge of the situation, and being accountable for your actions. Whether it‚Äôs in a personal or professional context, accepting responsibility helps build trust and respect, as it shows that you value the other person‚Äôs feelings and opinions, and that you are committed to your relationship‚Äôs growth and well-being. Accepting another person‚Äôs flaws is also essential in building strong relationships. Nobody is perfect, and everyone has their weaknesses and imperfections. Accepting and embracing these blemishes is a sign of maturity and empathy, and it shows that you are willing to look beyond their flaws and see the best in them. By accepting each other‚Äôs imperfections, we create a sense of safety and security, and we allow ourselves to be vulnerable and authentic with each other. Heeding warning signs is perhaps the most crucial aspect of building healthy relationships. These warning signs could come in various forms ‚Äì a gut feeling, a red flag or a feeling of unease. They are usually subtle cues that something is off, and ignoring them could spell disaster for the relationship. Whether it‚Äôs a partner‚Äôs unwillingness to compromise, or a friend‚Äôs tendency to gossip behind each other‚Äôs backs, knowing and listening to these warning signs could help us avoid getting hurt, emotionally or physically. In conclusion, building healthy relationships requires effort, patience, and commitment. Taking responsibility for our actions, accepting each other‚Äôs flaws, and heeding warning signs are fundamental elements that will help us create meaningful and lasting connections. By embodying these values, we foster trust, respect, love, and empathy, and we create relationships that are grounded in mutual respect, understanding, and kindness."},{"instruction":"was printed in 1985 by Kids Can Press and published in Hong Kong by Everbest .

Non-affiliated individuals refer to those who do not identify with any particular organized religion, while atheists refer to those who do not believe in a god or gods. One study conducted in 2015 found that approximately 22.8% of Americans identified as non-affiliated, while only 3.1% identified as atheists. This trend was mirrored in other parts of the world, as a study conducted by WIN/Gallup International in 2017 found that 25% of the global population identified as non-affiliated, while only 9% identified as atheists. It is important to note that these numbers may be subject to variation due to different survey methodologies and cultural factors. In some countries, identifying as an atheist may carry negative social implications and as a result, individuals may be hesitant to openly identify as such. Additionally, some individuals who identify as non-affiliated may still believe in a god or gods but do not associate with any particular organized religion.

However, there's now a solution that benefits both parties involved. Collars are being used to alert rangers when predators, such as lions, venture out of the Nairobi National Park. GPS coordinates are then sent by text messages to the rangers' mobile phones. This new approach is a win-win situation. Farmers can protect their livestock while the lions can safely roam in their natural habitat.

Proper care and attention to the sheep's needs can prevent diseases and conditions that can harm their health and income. To maintain the health of your sheep, you need to perform preventative health care, keep an eye on general health, de-worm your sheep, and maintain their hooves properly. One of the essential tasks in maintaining the health of your sheep is hoof trimming. Sheep hooves grow continuously, and if not attended to, can cause pain, infections, and lameness. Regular trimming at least once a year is a critical step to keep your sheep healthy and happy. Shearing is another important aspect of maintaining sheep health. Shearing helps to remove the thick wool, preventing overheating during hot seasons and reducing the chances of parasitic infestations. You need to shear your sheep at least once a year to assist them in maintaining proper body temperature and hygiene. Preventive health care, such as vaccinations and regular checkups, is vital in sustaining healthy sheep. This measure helps you to detect and prevent diseases before they occur, saving both money and time. Work with a veterinarian to determine the best preventative measures for your flock. There is a need to keep an eye on the general health of your sheep regularly. Look out for signs of illness, stress, or any changes in behavior that may indicate ill-health. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the spread of diseases and sickness in your flock. Lastly, it is crucial to de-worm your sheep regularly to prevent parasitic infestations. Parasites can lead to anemia, weight loss, and decreased productivity in your flock. Consult with a veterinarian to determine the appropriate medication for your sheep's de-worming. In conclusion, maintaining the health of your sheep is critical for their well-being and productivity. Perform regular preventative health care, keep an eye on general health, de-worm your sheep, maintain their hooves properly, and shear them at least once a year.

The imposition of a curfew in Srinagar is a necessary measure to maintain law and order in the city. However, it has not been enough to stop the violent demonstrations.

Despite the grievances raised by the drivers, council bosses have maintained that the signs and cameras in place are adequate.

It's important for local authorities to ensure that warnings are clear and visible, so that drivers can avoid issuing penalties.

Juggling multiple tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities can easily leave us feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. However, there are several practical strategies that we can use to boost our productivity and reduce stress in our daily lives. 1. Break Tasks Down into Manageable Sizes One of the most effective ways to manage a large workload is to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. By breaking a project or task into smaller steps, you can create a clear roadmap for completing it and make progress more easily. This not only helps you stay more structured and focused, but it also reduces the likelihood of procrastination. 2. Try Using Productivity Apps Thanks to technology, there are now a plethora of productivity apps available that can help us stay on track and manage our time better. These apps can help with task management, time tracking, calendars, and reminders. Some popular productivity apps include Trello, Todoist, and Focus@Will. 3. Take Mental Health Breaks It's important to take regular breaks throughout the workday to avoid burnout and give ourselves a chance to decompress. Rather than scrolling through social media or browsing the internet, consider taking a short walk, meditating, or doing some simple stretching exercises. 4. Reward Yourself for Completing Tasks Sometimes, the best motivation comes from setting a goal and rewarding ourselves for achieving it. Whether it's a small treat like a cup of coffee or a more significant reward like a night out, setting incentives can help us stay on track and keep our eye on the prize. 5. Have an Accountability Partner Having someone to hold us accountable for our goals and milestones can be a powerful motivator. Consider finding a like-minded colleague or friend who shares similar work goals and hold each other accountable through regular check-ins or meetings. 6. Set a Timer to Keep You on Track Setting a timer for tasks can help us stay on track and ensure that we complete tasks within a reasonable timeframe. It can also help us avoid getting sidetracked by other tasks or distractions. There are several apps available that can help with this - including Pomodoro Technique. In conclusion, there are many effective strategies for boosting productivity and reducing stress. By breaking tasks down into manageable sizes, using productivity apps, taking mental health breaks, rewarding ourselves for completing tasks, having an accountability partner, and setting a timer, we can accomplish our work goals more efficiently and with less stress."},{"instruction":"Think of it as a bend and not a break If I can I will scan the X ray that shows it the clearest and post it here .

The government aims to help minimize this impact by assessing the quality of the parent's relationship. In an effort to promote family stability and well-being, the government will be monitoring whether parents report having a \\"good quality relationship\\" in surveys. This new approach in assessing family stability is meant to encourage parents to work on improving communication and conflict resolution skills to minimize the potential negative effects of separation on their children. There is no question that children suffer when their parents separate or divorce. Studies have shown that the impact can manifest in various ways, including poorer academic performance, mental health issues, and an increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. While divorce or separation can never be completely avoided, the government's new approach is designed to promote relationship education that will help parents manage conflict better, reduce stress, and promote stability within households for their children. It is important to note that the government's new approach is not about dictating how parents should live their lives or whether they should stay together at all costs. It is, however, about understanding that the family structure does matter in a child's development and promoting healthy communication and relationships between parents is vital for a positive impact on the child's mental health and well-being. Ultimately, the government aims to promote strong and healthy families by providing parents with the tools to strengthen their relationships, reduce stress on their children, and minimize the impact of separation or divorce."},{"instruction":"Premise: well they they should work their way they you know they should should be able to work their self out of it or you know why why why intervene in another country's you know problems and things like that why why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that but i think just a lot of times if we don't then then it will then that influence will affect our country too for one and for two you know that it does help i mean you know i think the people in those countries do want our help the people that are you know under conditions that are you know not favorable to this their rights Hypothesis: I don't think we need to concern ourselves with the troubles of other entities; they should be able to work it out for themselves.

First, we can simplify by moving all terms that include y on one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. Thus, we can add 11y to both sides of the equation to get: -11y + 11y + 3 = -12y + 11y Simplifying this expression gives: 3 = -y To solve for y, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get: y = -3"},{"instruction":"the word approach used in the same way in the following two sentences?

Earlier coalgas methods had been used for lighting since the 1820s, but they were expensive. Gesner's kerosene was cheap, easy to produce, could be burned in existing lamps, and did not produce an offensive odor as did most whale oil. It could be stored indefinitely, unlike whale oil, which would eventually spoil. The American petroleum boom began in the 1850s. By the end of the decade there were 30 kerosene plants operating in the United States. The cheaper, more efficient fuel began to drive whale oil out of the market. John D. Rockefeller was most responsible for the commercial success of kerosene. He set up a network of kerosene distilleries which would later become Standard Oil, thus completely abolishing the need for whaleoil lamps.
