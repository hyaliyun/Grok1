Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when MarieAntoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been led in triumph during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on MarieAntoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.

A field goal of 5 yards is typically attempted when a team is within the opponent's 10 yard line, but they are unable to score a touchdown or gain any more yards on the field. In this case, the team can choose to kick a field goal from the 5 yard line, which is a high percentage play for NFL kickers. In fact, the majority of NFL field goals are made from this range, as the shorter distance makes it easier to accurately kick the ball through the goal post. However, this doesn't mean that it is a guaranteed success.

Transfer the corn to a baking sheet and put it in the oven for four hours.","output":"Drying corn is an essential step to prevent the germination process and extend its shelf life. One of the easiest and most effective ways to dry corn is by using a food dehydrator. Here's how you can do it: Start by shucking the corn and removing the silk. Cut the kernels off the cob and spread them out evenly on the dehydrator trays. Set the dehydrator's temperature to 130 to 140°F, and let the corn dry for several hours. To check the moisture content, weigh the dried corn and compare it to its fresh weight. Ideally, the corn's moisture levels should be at around 10 percent or lower to prevent any mold or bacteria growth. If the corn's moisture content is still high, increase the temperature on the dehydrator and leave it for a few more hours until it reaches the desired level of dryness. Once the corn is sufficiently dry, transfer it to a baking sheet and put it in the oven at 150°F for approximately four hours. This step helps remove any remaining moisture and brings out the corn's natural sweetness. After the four hours, take the corn out of the oven and let it cool down to room temperature. Store the dried corn in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. With proper storage, the dried corn can last for several months. In conclusion, drying corn in a food dehydrator is a simple and effective way to preserve its freshness and extend its shelf life. By following the steps above, you can be assured that your corn will be perfectly dried and ready for use in your next culinary adventure."},{"instruction":"Write the last sentence in this story.

One of the main factors is which league or level of football we are talking about. For example, if we look at the NFL, the sixth longest TD pass as of the end of the 2020 season was thrown by Tom Brady of the New England Patriots during a game against the Miami Dolphins on September 12, 2011. The pass was 99 yards long. If we look at college football, the answer is a little different. According to NCAA records, the sixth longest TD pass was thrown by Cole McDonald of the University of Hawaii during a game against the University of Arizona on September 15, 2018. The pass was also 99 yards. Now, if we take a wider look at all levels of football, including high school and other amateur leagues, it's not as clear cut. There are likely many players who have thrown TD passes of 99 yards or longer, and it would be difficult to determine exactly who holds the sixth longest without researching and compiling a comprehensive list. Overall, the answer to the question of which player threw the sixth longest TD pass is dependent on the level of football we are looking at.

Soak your tulle in hot water. Pour a liquid dye mix into the detergent slot. Add hot water to the detergent slot equal to the amount of dye you used. Put in 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of detergent. Add 4 cups (950 ml) of hot salt water after 10 minutes of soaking. Wash your tulle and dye in hot, high water. Run the washing machine with warm water and detergent until the tulle stops bleeding ink. Clean your washing machine before using it again.","output":"Article: Dying tulle can be a great way to customize the appearance of this delicate fabric for dresses, veils, or decorations. However, if you do not prewash and dye the tulle correctly, the results may not be what you expected. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to prepare and dye your tulle effectively. Step 1: Prewash your tulle Before dyeing your tulle, you should prewash it as you would with any other fabric to remove any dirt, oil, or sizing that may resist the dye. Use warm water and mild detergent to wash and rinse the tulle thoroughly. You can either hand wash or use a washing machine with a gentle cycle and no fabric softener. Step 2: Soak your tulle in hot water Fill a large container or sink with hot water, and immerse the prewashed tulle. Use enough water to submerge the tulle and allow it to move freely. Let it soak for at least 10 to 15 minutes to ensure that the fabric is fully wet and receptive to the dye. Step 3: Mix the dye Choose a high-quality fabric dye that is suitable for synthetic fibers such as tulle. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the dye by mixing it with hot water or other recommended liquids. Then, pour the dye mix into the slot designated for detergent in your washing machine. Step 4: Add hot water and detergent To help the dye spread evenly and adhere to the tulle, you should add an equal amount of hot water to the detergent slot. For example, if you used one cup of dye, add one cup of hot water to the same slot. Then, add a tablespoon of mild detergent to the slot as well. Step 5: Add hot salt water After the tulle has soaked for 10 minutes, add four cups of hot saltwater to the washing machine. The saltwater helps the dye fix the fabric and reduce bleeding. You can dissolve enough table salt in hot water until you get a saturated solution. Step 6: Wash the tulle and dye Turn on your washing machine and select hot or high temperatures with a long cycle. Make sure the tulle is evenly distributed in the machine to avoid clumping or tearing. Let the machine run until the color stops bleeding, and the water runs clear. This step might take several wash cycles. Step 7: Clean your washing machine Before using your washing machine for other items, you should clean it thoroughly to prevent accidental dye transfer. Run the machine on an empty cycle with hot water and a cup of bleach, vinegar, or specialized washing machine cleaner. In conclusion, dyeing tulle requires some preparation and patience, but the results can be stunning. By following the steps above, you can ensure that your tulle absorbs the dye evenly, and the color remains vibrant and long-lasting. Remember to always read the dye's instructions carefully, avoid mixing different dyes or fabrics, and use protective clothing, gloves, and ventilation to stay safe."},{"instruction":"fact, we put together a 5. 6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security.

Initial theoretical predictions of the number of human genes were as high as 2,000,000. Early experimental measures indicated there to be 50,000–100,000 transcribed genes (expressed sequence tags). Subsequently, the sequencing in the Human Genome Project indicated that many of these transcripts were alternative variants of the same genes, and the total number of proteincoding genes was revised down to ~20,000 with 13 genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Of the human genome, only 1–2% consists of proteincoding genes, with the remainder being 'noncoding' DNA such as introns, retrotransposons, and noncoding RNAs.

But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick Babe, we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named Stuff. But the results are nowhere near as charming, and the scare level is virtually nil. Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle. Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride.

This phantom is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness.

Poor air quality can cause various health problems, including headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and respiratory issues. To improve indoor air quality, it is essential to recognize the health symptoms and identify the potential hazards. One of the primary factors to consider is humidity and dew buildup. High humidity levels can cause mold and mildew growth, which can affect respiratory health. It is crucial to keep a check on the humidity levels, especially in areas like bathrooms, kitchen, and laundry rooms. Use dehumidifiers and air conditioning to regulate humidity levels and prevent dew buildup. Another factor to consider is the pilot lights that go out frequently. Gas stoves, water heaters, and furnaces often use pilot lights to provide heat, and if the flame goes out frequently, it can indicate a problem with the appliance. Carbon monoxide (CO) can build up and cause severe health consequences. CO is an odorless and colorless gas that can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and even death. To prevent CO poisoning, install CO detectors and ensure that all fuel-burning appliances are well-maintained. Fuel-burning engines indoors can also be a significant contributor to poor indoor air quality. These include gas-powered generators, lawn mowers, and snow blowers. When these engines are used indoors, they release carbon monoxide and other harmful gases that can cause severe health issues. It is essential to use these engines outdoors and keep them at least 20 feet away from the house. In conclusion, maintaining good indoor air quality is essential for a healthy living environment. By recognizing the health symptoms and identifying potential hazards, you can take measures to improve the air quality in your home. Keep a check on the humidity levels, install CO detectors, and use fuel-burning engines outdoors to maintain good indoor air quality."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Mr. Danvers had told me to watch out.

William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, second son of the Prince of Orange. Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning.

While not always an efficient form of pest control, varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated.

Some animals, such as wild rabbits or squirrels, may be utilised for fur or meat, but often no use is made of the carcass. Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area. Common varmints may include various rodents, coyotes, crows, foxes, feral cats, and feral hogs. Some animals once considered varmints are now protected, such as wolves.

None of the characters come across as being even remotely human.

These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river.

Being in a relationship should not make us feel trapped or limited in our choices. One way to evaluate this is to reflect on our feelings around our partner. Do we feel free to be ourselves or do we feel like we have to put on a different persona to please them? Another important factor to consider is how our partner communicates with us. Do they speak to us respectfully and without judgement? Or do they criticize and belittle us? A healthy relationship should be built on communication that promotes growth and understanding, not tearing down one another. Feeling safe and secure should also be a priority. Relationships that are built on fear and threats are not healthy or sustainable. Being with a partner who encourages and supports us allows us to feel secure and confident in ourselves and our relationship. Lastly, it is crucial to evaluate the mutual fulfillment of our sex life. A healthy sexual relationship should involve open communication, mutual respect, and a desire to please and be pleased. If we feel that our sexual needs are not being met or that we are being pressured into things that we are not comfortable with, it is important to speak up and address these concerns.

The sounds of the river rushing by, the smell of the pine trees, and the crackle of the campfire all brought back memories of my childhood. Over the course of the weekend, we hiked through the mountains, swam in the river, and stayed up late telling stories around the campfire. It was a magical experience, one that reminded me of how much I love spending time in nature. As we packed up to leave on Sunday morning, I knew that this wouldn't be our last camping trip.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Dubai, known for its glitz and glamour, can be a wonderful vacation spot for many. However, it's important to keep in mind that the local laws and customs are considerably more conservative than what many tourists may be used to. A recent campaign by embassy staff cleverly used the well-known rhyme of \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" to highlight some of the potential pitfalls that travellers may encounter in Dubai. The poem, told through the eyes of a fictional traveller, emphasizes the importance of being aware of the area's strict decency laws. Foreigners in Dubai must be mindful of their clothing choices and avoid showing too much skin, especially during Ramadan. Public displays of affection are also strictly forbidden, and travellers should be careful to refrain from any inappropriate behavior. Additionally, drinking and driving is not tolerated, and individuals caught violating this law may face severe penalties. While it may seem challenging to navigate the cultural norms of a foreign country, it's essential to do so in order to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip. The embassy's playful yet informative campaign serves as an excellent reminder of the importance of being respectful of the local laws and customs while traveling. A little bit of research and preparation can go a long way in avoiding potential pitfalls and making the most of your vacation."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Bounty survivor: Captain should have ordered crew to abandon ship 4 hours sooner. First report by federal investigators blames HMS Bounty sinking on captain and ship owners. Captain went missing after shipwreck; deckhand Claudene Christian died in the disaster. Lawyer for victim's family says her parents are not doing well at all","output":"The sinking of the HMS Bounty in October 2012 has been a haunting tragedy, claiming one life and leaving several others adrift in the stormy waters of the Atlantic. The recent release of the first report by federal investigators has highlighted the key factors that led to the disaster, including the questionable decision-making of the ship's captain and owners. According to the report, Captain Robin Walbridge should have ordered his team to abandon the vessel at least four hours sooner than he did. The Royal Navy veteran was determined to ride out Hurricane Sandy, believing that he and his crew could weather the colossal waves and vicious winds. In the end, this gamble cost him his ship and the life of his deckhand, Claudene Christian. The report also implicates the ship's owners, the HMS Bounty Organization, for their inadequate safety procedures and failure to provide adequate training to the crew. This is a stark reminder of the importance of safety measures in the maritime industry, especially in dangerous weather conditions. Claudene Christian's parents, who lost their daughter in the disaster, are understandably devastated by the report's findings. Their lawyer has commented that they are \\"not doing well at all\\", expressing their anger and sorrow at the fact that their daughter's life was needlessly risked by the irresponsible actions of others. This tragedy serves as a grim reminder of the harsh realities of life at sea, and the importance of effective leadership and safety measures in high-risk environments.

This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and that the frequency (f = v/λ) of the wave is not affected by the refractive index. As a result, the energy (E = h f) of the photon, and therefore the perceived color of the refracted light to a human eye which depends on photon energy, is not affected by the refraction or the refractive index of the medium.

This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in the north of what is now England, in Cornwall and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, having been Christianised, traditionally by the RomanoBriton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as the Dark Ages, Ireland entered a golden age and responded with missions (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities.

Get your cat's eyes examined. Look for red eye in your cat. Look for a shadow on the retina. Follow the vet's treatment recommendations. Consider treating your cat's pain.","output":"Taking Your Cat to the Vet for Eye Examinations: Importance and Treatment Recommendations Cats are often considered self-sufficient and do not require much care when compared to dogs or other animals. However, neglecting your cat's health can have severe consequences, particularly when it comes to their eyes. Eye problems can pose significant risks to your cat's overall health, and it's essential to take them to a veterinarian for regular eye examinations. During the eye examination, the vet will examine the cat's eyes for any redness, discharge, or inflammation. Additionally, the vet may also use specialized equipment to conduct a detailed examination of the cat's eyes. One of the most critical parts of the examination is checking for the presence of a shadow on the retina, which can signify a more severe underlying condition. Treatment recommendations will depend entirely on the findings of the eye examination. When treating any issues, the vet may prescribe medications or ointments to treat infections or reduce inflammation. In some cases, the vet may recommend surgery to prevent further damage or to address more severe problems. Lastly, your vet may suggest options for treating any pain your cat may be experiencing. Pain can be tough to recognize in cats, but common signs of pain include restlessness, irritability, or being uninterested in usual activities. Understandably, your cat may be apprehensive or unhappy about receiving treatments or medications. In these cases, you may need to be more patient and consider options for easing their discomfort or anxiety. In conclusion, taking your cat to a vet for regular eye examinations is crucial for their overall health and well-being. Not only will it help identify any potential issues early, but it can also help uncover underlying conditions that may require more extensive treatment or surgery. Make sure to provide the necessary care and attention to your furry friend and consider seeking help as soon as you notice any abnormal behavior or changes in your cat's eyes."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The competition took place for the first time in New Zealand.

Once we have that number, we can subtract the number of people who are under 18 years old and over 65 years old from the total population to find the number of people who fall between those two age groups. Let's assume that the total population of the area we are interested in is 100,000 people. We can use this number to calculate the percentage of people who are neither under 18 nor over 65. According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately 22% of the population is made up of people under the age of 18, and 16% of the population is over the age of 65. This means that a total of 38% of the population falls outside of the age range we are interested in. To calculate the percentage of people who are between the ages of 18 and 65, we simply subtract 38% from 100%. This tells us that approximately 62% of the population falls between those two age groups. So, to answer the original question, approximately 62% of the population is neither under 18 nor over 65.

Hulanicki has expressed her concerns over the increasing sexualisation of fashion and celebrities in particular, stating that she feels the liberation of the 60s has gone too far. She has criticised the trend for celebrities to show off excessive amounts of flesh, likening it to pornography. In her opinion, many celebrities use their cleavages to attract attention and promote themselves rather than their talent. Beyond her criticisms of current fashion trends, Hulanicki also expressed concern over the age that girls start taking contraceptive pills, suggesting that it is contributing to the sexualisation of younger generations. Her perspective is grounded in her experiences in the 60s when women's liberation was centred around the power to control one's own body. Despite her concerns, Hulanicki's legacy as the founder of Biba has cemented her as an icon of British fashion. Biba became a symbol of the Swinging Sixties, known for its bold prints and youthful designs. The brand has inspired many other designers and has left a lasting impact on the fashion industry. Hulanicki's return to Biba as a consultant for House of Fraser has brought excitement to the fashion industry.

Although they are expected to take 10 days off, which is considered to be an improvement from previous years, it still falls short compared to Europeans who have 25 to 30 vacation days. Interestingly, Japanese workers are expected to take even fewer vacation days, with the average being only five days out of 13. This can be attributed to the country's strong work culture and the idea that taking too much time off may be seen as a lack of commitment to one's job. On the other hand, Europeans seem to be champions in making the most of their vacation time, with many taking their full allotted days off. This is likely due to the cultural value placed on work-life balance in European countries. It's important to note that taking time off from work is crucial for mental health and overall well-being. Studies have shown that employees who take regular vacations are more productive and engaged in their work compared to those who don't. So, it's time for Americans and Japanese workers to start taking their full vacation days and prioritize their mental health and well-being.

This news has come as a shock to many who knew him as a respected serviceman. McKenzie's military background had reportedly prepared him for the discipline and the structure of the army. However, after serving for several years, he was discharged in 2008. It remains unclear why McKenzie was discharged, but some speculate that it may have been related to mental health issues. Indeed, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common occurrence among soldiers who have served in war-torn areas. Regardless of the reason for his discharge, McKenzie found himself in trouble with the law after the recent raid on the two homes. It is not yet clear what the police found during the raid, but McKenzie has been charged and is awaiting trial. Many are now left wondering what led McKenzie down this path. Was it the trauma of war that caused him to turn to illegal activity? Or was it something else entirely? Whatever the reason, it is a painful reminder that soldiers who serve in conflicts abroad often face significant challenges when they return home. The government and society as a whole must do more to support these brave men and women and help them to readjust to civilian life.

The final touchdown of any game can be the deciding factor that determines the winning team. It's the moment that the crowd cheers the loudest, the players give it their all, and the scoreboards light up with excitement. However, sometimes, it's hard to keep track of which player actually scored the last point of the game. In the recent game between Team A and Team B, the final touchdown was scored by none other than Team A's star player, John Smith. With only a few seconds left on the clock, Team A had the ball on their 20-yard line, and the score was tied at 21-21. The tension in the stadium was palpable, with both teams vying for the win. John Smith had been the standout player of the game so far, racking up a total of three touchdowns and gaining over 200 yards on the field. As the ball was snapped, he ran a perfect route, dodging his opponents along the way. The quarterback threw the ball towards him, and he caught it with ease, running towards the endzone. At this point, the blockers on his team had formed a human wall, and John sprinted through it, dodging the last defender and diving towards the goal line. The referee's whistle blew, indicating a touchdown, and the crowd erupted into applause. Team A had won the game, and John Smith had sealed the deal with his final touchdown. In conclusion, John Smith was the player who scored the final touchdown of the game, securing a win for Team A. His exceptional skills and impressive performance throughout the game had made it evident that he was the right man for the job.

In fact, it's just the beginning. If you want your short story to be the best it can be, there are several steps you can take to refine and polish it. First, read your short story out loud. This will help you identify any awkward phrasing or clunky sentence structure that might be difficult to spot when reading silently. As you read, take note of any parts that you stumble over, as those are likely areas that need some revision. Once you've read your story aloud, revise it for clarity and flow. Look for any parts that feel confusing, redundant, or disconnected, and make changes to smooth out the narrative. Be sure to pay attention to pacing and transitions, as these are key components of a well-crafted short story. Next, come up with an interesting title that captures the essence of your story. A good title can draw readers in and set the tone for what's to come, so take some time to brainstorm ideas and test them out with others. Finally, share your short story with others and ask for their feedback. Whether it's a writing group, beta readers, or trusted friends and family members, getting outside perspectives can be incredibly valuable in improving your story. Listen to their suggestions with an open mind, and be willing to make changes that will strengthen your work. Ultimately, writing a short story is a collaborative process that involves revision, critique, and refinement.

Avoid canning foods that are low in acid unless you're properly equipped. Use the right ingredients to kill bacteria. Use a method that provides appropriate levels of heat to kill the bacteria. Process any flesh product in temperatures at 240ºF/115.6ºC or higher. Find alternatives that are safer than canning. Make safe oil infusions.","output":"Canning has long been one of the most popular methods of food preservation. It's a simple process that allows you to store your favorite foods for later use. However, it is essential to take necessary precautions to ensure that the food you are canning is safe to eat. One of the most important things to keep in mind when canning is to use up-to-date preserving recipes. Follow recipes from reliable sources such as the USDA or reputable canning organizations. Old recipes may not consider the latest safety standards, leading to potentially dangerous food. Low-acid foods such as vegetables, meats, and dairy products require special treatment due to the risk of botulism, a lethal bacteria that can develop in certain environments. If you're canning low-acid foods, make sure you use a pressure canner that will reach and maintain temperatures of 240ºF/115.6ºC, killing the bacteria and making the food safe to eat. Another crucial aspect of safe canning is to use the right ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid, to kill bacteria effectively. Additionally, use fresh and high-quality produce free from any damages, molds, or bruises. It's also essential to use the appropriate method for each canning project. The boiling water method is suitable for high-acid foods such as pickles, jams, and jellies. Low-acid foods, on the other hand, require a pressure canner. If you're not comfortable with canning, consider alternatives that are safer and easier to use. Freezing, fermenting, and drying are all effective methods to preserve food. Finally, if you want to create infused oils, make sure to do so safely. Infused oils can quickly become hazardous if not prepared correctly. To make a safe infusion, add dry herbs to the oil and gently heat for a few minutes. Let it cool and strain it through cheesecloth before storing it in a cool, dry place. In conclusion, canning can be a fantastic way to preserve food. However, it's essential to take the right precautions and follow safety guidelines to prevent foodborne illness. Use up-to-date recipes, avoid canning low-acid foods unless you're correctly equipped, use the right ingredients, appropriate heat levels, and consider alternatives such as freezing, fermenting, or drying. Finally, if you're making oil infusions, make sure to follow safe practices to prevent bacteria growth."},{"instruction":"@kiki_the_blub : Mum and helper are fine. But.. not me.

This ban will prohibit smoking in all indoor public spaces, including restaurants, bars, and workplaces. This ban comes after the French health agency, in 2011, declared electronic cigarettes to be dangerous. The agency expressed concern over the lack of regulation and potential health risks associated with these products. As a result, the sale and use of electronic cigarettes are strictly regulated in France. The decision to ban traditional cigarettes and regulate e-cigarettes is a significant step forward in the fight against smoking-related illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. By banning smoking in public spaces and regulating the use of e-cigarettes, France is taking a proactive approach to reduce the harmful effects of smoking on the population. While some may argue that the ban infringes on individual freedom, it is important to consider the greater good. Smoking not only harms the smoker but also those around them through second-hand smoke exposure. Banning smoking in public spaces will protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of tobacco. In conclusion, the new five-year ban on regular tobacco cigarettes is a significant step forward in the fight against smoking-related illnesses in France. By regulating e-cigarettes and banning smoking in public spaces, France is prioritizing the health and well-being of its citizens."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: Who famously lived at Robben Island prison from 19641990?","output":"Nelson Mandela."},{"instruction":"xandros desktop is another debianbased distribution for the desktop market, which appeared after corel linux.

Rather than tossing them aside, try stretching them out with a simple technique that can be done at home: using your freezer. To begin, fill two sandwich bags halfway full of water. Make sure there are no leaks, and seal the bags tightly. Then, place one baggie in each shoe, ensuring the water is evenly distributed throughout the toe and heel areas. Next, put the shoes still containing the water-filled bags into a bigger, sealed plastic bag. Place the bag into your freezer, making sure the shoes are lying flat. Wait for 3 to 4 hours, and then remove the shoes from the freezer. Take the bags of water out of your shoes and let them defrost for a minute before removing the bags. Finally, try on your shoes and see if they have stretched to your desired size. This technique works by using the water inside the bags to expand and contract as it freezes and thaws, respectively. The expansion of the water causes the shoes to stretch slightly, and the process can be repeated until the desired fit is achieved. No more breaking in uncomfortable shoes, or having to endure a tight fit all day.

This is a significant development for China, which has poured significant resources into research and development over the last few years.

While China has increased its share of the world's most cited research papers, the gap between China and the US remains significant. In other words, while China is publishing more, its research is not as highly regarded as the US'. Nevertheless, China's rise in scientific output underscores the country's growing global influence. It may also represent a challenge to the US, which has traditionally been the global leader in scientific research.

Conservative Michele Bachmann links two as hard left move to nanny state Medical organizations back breastfeeding, support IRS move. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In recent news, former President Barack Obama has shown support for breast-feeding as a means to limit obesity in children. This statement was met with controversy, as conservative figure Michele Bachmann labelled this notion as a \\"hard left\\" move towards a \\"nanny state\\". Despite opposition, medical organizations have backed Obama's stance and have also shown support for the IRS move to list breast-feeding supplies as medical expenses. Breast-feeding has been proven to provide numerous benefits to both the mother and child. For the child, breast milk contains all the necessary nutrients and antibodies needed for growth and development. Breast-fed infants have a lower risk of developing infections, allergies, and obesity. For the mother, breast-feeding can help with postpartum recovery and has been linked to a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The IRS move to list breast-feeding supplies as medical expenses was a positive step towards recognizing the importance of breast-feeding. This would allow for breast pumps, nursing bras, and other supplies to be tax-deductible for mothers. However, Bachmann disagreed with this move, stating that it was an \\"intrusion into the family\\". Medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization strongly support breast-feeding and have backed Obama's push for its promotion. They argue that breast-feeding is not only beneficial for the individual child, but also has positive effects on a community as a whole. It can lead to decreased healthcare costs and a healthier population overall. In conclusion, while breast-feeding has been a controversial topic, it is important to recognize the numerous benefits that it can provide. The push for breast-feeding promotion and support from medical organizations is crucial in ensuring that mothers have access to the resources necessary for successful breast-feeding. The IRS move to list breast-feeding supplies as medical expenses is also a positive step towards recognizing the importance of breast-feeding."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],R={key:0},H={key:1};function F(o,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",B,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
